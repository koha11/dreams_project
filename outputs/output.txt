Dream and analysis: 
Good morning, my professor and assistant professor! 
Thank you for guiding me on this journey. I worked with the angel Caliel with the important question:
"Is my boyfriend a husband fit for my developing quality" (I have asked it for two months) 
Here is my first dream:
My boyfriend and I came back to  his home - not his present house. His family had dinner but we
have not eaten  . I prepared  the meal for both of us. His younger sister showed me the place to
take the food. The preparation was nearly completed with a lack of fish sauce so he was taking it. I
went down to the ground floor   while he was on the high floor . Then he finished making fish
sauce, I went up without his call. When I am on the highest floor, he and my old girlfriend  swinged down by rope and he dropped the
friend off. He intended to ask me to marry but I was at the beginning position  and I was looking down.
The second dream: "I was attacked by a white strong light from both sides when I ran after a friend   I could not open my eyes . I did
Tai Chi weakly before I fainted."  
I am too strict on myself, it prevents me from receiving the reality related to 2 polarities.

The third dream: " My friend, Y and I discovered a white strange paint stain falling down from the roof when my paternal family
gathered to celebrate flew down to find us but we escaped so it flew away. 
A next scene, a white paint stain from the roof fell down on some children , they just dissolved, a big creature attacked, luckily a man hit
the creature and it disappeared. 
A next scent, when the family gathered in the attic , my mother and I saw a paint stain, and I announced dissolving immediately.
Everyone except I and Y ran to the door . We hid to the back, jumped to other roofs to hide and find the signal of the creature. Some of
the adults also found it when he was preparing to attack but it ran away in our way. I was protected by my cousin when I was on the roof.
Then, I was on the way back home . I have just been on a bridge then a big water flowed and brought  a big shark . I held the bridge
and pretended to die and escaped.   When I was at home, I decided to pick my lover up to my house to have dinner. His home is in a
military area . It used to be a school where I spent my time when I was a child. I guaranteed to protect him and I believed I can do it.
When I crossed the military school, it was a big wind but I still took him to his home." 
Third dream is "I was in a class and prepared for an examination . A woman teacher guided me using a cow replace a pig for the
examination ."  
Fourth dream is " a registration of marriage "
There are some memories let me leave off the spiritual way. 
Fifth dream is "I, Oanh Quang  , Nguyen and some friends gathered at a place on a floor  to chat and then moved to a party . We
needed to walk to the party. The street was like a street coming to . There were. many groups dressed in different clothes . I was
suddenly called from a group. The group is 3 girls wearing hoodies . I was invited to dance   together with them on the platform. Then I
moved to another place. All my friends disappeared . I knew they were coming back in the first place, I was waiting for them in anger.
After a long time, they rode across me to leave."
Thank you very much.

Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana 
Wish you have a nice day!!! This period time, I continue focusing to the question: "Is my present job
still suitable for my life program?" I received some dreams from the Up-Above but I cannot
remember.
My company has a big change in the next time. My boss confirmed to sell our company. I can continue working at the present position.
The new owner will invest and expand the company with a big mission. Is it a good sign for myself?   I have not met the new owner. My
manager told me the new owner was a rich group. Buying our company is just a small project. The company can join to a supply chain
with other companies in the group. I think I should ask the Up Above to have an answer more clearly.
I also noted a dream this week as below:
1. I came to Binh Yen Noi - in English, it means a peace place where I and my friends went camping as I told you in last dream journal.  I
came to take a birthday cake ..I reserved. 
2. I was on the way coming to my company.   I try a new way. I went up following 2 young men  They gave up when they were in the
middle of a slope.   I felt the way was not right but I still wanted to try. I went to the highest of the slope   and saw Binh Yen Noi . I told the
waiter   I was lost, he guided me went down  because of no other ways.  will be late at my work. I tried to run to my company . The
company was in a building. I forgot bringing the elevator card I ran to the elevator and received the help from the guards. Coming in the

company, I saw two men who were threatening me   There were a man who we had a deep relationship and a man who I was in a love
relationship. They were protecting me .

Thank you

Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana 
Yesterday, I had an argument with my manager   I did not accept his requirement related to a
notification with other department. I lost my control and after that I regret that. I must spend a little
time to focus doing mantra with Angel Menadel. 
This week, I work with the intention "help find work" and I receive this dream as below:
My friends and I had a trip  to Vung Tau - a coastal city in Vietnam .  We came to a resort  where
we had an intention to stay  After going to bathroom and visiting it, we were announced that it was
full so we must find another place. 
on internet and we decided to move them. My couple and
another couple ( Quang and Oanh)  were the final people leaving from the parking lot . A woman
appeared and offered us her villa   - 22 million Vietnam dong/day. I quickly calculated 220000
VND/person/day. We and others decided to visit her villa. I forced others making decision after
watching it.

Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana, 
This week, I am busy working more than normal to prepare for transferring the owner of our
company. I work hard such as completing my tasks, supporting my teammate, receiving some new
tasks ...I see two opinions appearing: "feeling happy to have more work" and another "feeling tired
because of too much" in my company. A percentage of myself does not like to do too much  But I
understand it lasts a short period. Besides, I hope that I can have more work to do in the future. In
my department, this time, there is a member who has to handle more work than us. We offer to help
her but she refuses because it takes more time to guide us than do by herself She mentioned many
times she was too busy because of too much work. I have a feeling I want to have more work to do this time to balance among our
department  . In the afternoon today, I have a small meeting with my manager. He guides me to do a sales report for the future and he
also has a wish to promote me to Deputy Manager. He gives me pluses: "eager to learn, manage data, work hard, be careful" and minus
"communication". He gives me some ways to improve that soft communication,  Taking care of others,... I am good at an independent job
but I am not sure what I can do for other members if I have a higher position. What can I do in this case?  
I would like to share a dream as below:
An owner - a man allowed me to invest money a long time to his forest I saw some trees  be cut down The cut spots were smeared
with substance . I asked him about that. He said those trees cannot grow again.

Thank you very much

Dream and analysis: 
Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana 
This week, I am working with Angel Jeliel and Angle Haziel. I have asked "Is my boyfriend a suitable
husband for my program?". I received some dreams and I just remembered some images from
them. I would like to share with you the following:
- I forgot to wear a bra when I went somewhere. When I found that , I quickly tried to find something
to cover. 
- I am standing on a small object floating on a large water 
Last week, my boyfriend and I went to a wedding of my best friends. Two of my best girl friends asked my boyfriend about the time we
will marry. I heard from them one of the reason is that my boyfriend is following many goals in his life but I never heard from him or
asked him about it. Is there a point I need to improve? Out of the confirmation from the Universe, what do I need to do for my couple, for
my boyfriend and for myself? I don't understand him enough. I am not sure I take care of him enough. I also have a thought many times
to reject our relationship. Sometimes, I want to be married, sometimes I don't want it. Why do I need to be married? Sister Vandana, what
is the right thing? What should I do? Nearly a long vacation, I do not want to come home or my boyfriend's home, because I will hear the
question: "When do we have a wedding? Why do we not make the final decision?" 

Additionally, I would like to share another story with you. I will leave the present company at the end of this month. My previous manager
offered me a job related to accounting and sales admin in a building for lease. I have not had experience in accounting but I accept to be
trained. My boss is good and the environment is good. My experience does not relate to it but I would like to do it. I will have a chance to
organize, arrange documents, service customers ... Besides, I have studied sql to explore data analytics. It is the beginning of a journey. I
see it is not easy at this age. But I still want to enjoy it. I feel happy when I solve a problem. I do not know how far I can go but I still
continue to discover it. My friend asked me where I want to gain in the long term but I do not have an answer. Is that right? 
Thank you very much,
Duyen

Dream and analysis: 
Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana, 
I would like to share with you the next story related to my couple's relationship. My boyfriend had
told me that he had made a decision for our relationship but he needed more time to inform me
officially. Last weekend, I shared my feelings and thoughts with my boyfriend. I asked him his
emotions and opinions realted to marriage. I talked a lot about my negative thoughts, bad feelings,
pressures, some intentions in marriage and raising a child... 
 He listened to my sharing. I reasked
his opinion. He required me to ask him yes-no questions instead of what, how, why questions Then, I
asked him if we were married? If we will get married in September as per Lunar calendar?. He said
yes and he let me know that his house in his hometown is being fixed. His family will come to my
home early. I am a little happy but a big worry because I have not received the answer from Up
Above for our relationship.
Observing myself and receiving some advice from a DSSI friend, I realized I gave myself many reasons to avoid marriage
- My wrong intention is perfection so I do not accept mistakes, learn from them. The friend reminded me of my intention on a new
journey. I do not follow to be a better person. I let the outside things, the memories, the future affect me a lot and I focus on the negative
too much. Although, I discussed becoming a better person to my boyfriend in the past. Mantra is one of the ways to help me remember
my final intention, rectify my memories and it is a process to be a better person. 

- I use the sentence: "My parents do not teach me about this topic" to avoid taking responsibility. I have a right to improve myself in it. 
- I need to communicate properly with my boyfriend. It is a lesson. I usually keep silent on the subjects related to marriage, babies, the
things I love, the things I hate, money ... with him because I am not confident to show myself.
- I did not improve myself to be a better person every day. I just asked the Up Above and hope they will give me the final answer. This
situation helps me to face the truth, the problems I need to rectify instead of delay.  
Last night, I had two dreams like the one below:
First dream: I dreamed of a case from the Harry Potter series. There was a man who tried to save a person but his younger sister died
.  
Second dream: It happened in my home. There was an elderly man who could not talk . He chose a kind of medicine in a  wardrobe . I
took 3 perfect pills and 1 urgly pill . I asked him to take the urgly pill first to delete it. 
Thank you very much,
Duyen

Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana, 
This week, I continue working on the intention related to my boyfriend. 
One night, after our date , when I crossed an old woman  who was riding a bike  at a turn , my
motorbike  fell because it hit a stone . I just injured my knee a little.
I also received a dream as below:
My friends and I had a party . After I got drunk , I had a short sleep I came back to the party and sat with my female friends  in the middle
of the table while the male friends sat at two sides of the table. My attitude was not friendly at that time  I ate some dishes on the table.
Then I saw myself at a large land. I went to a big road by bicycle and chose a direction. Firstly, I turned right on my intuition. There was
something incorrect I checked the google map and discovered I should turn left . So I turned left and I saw a woman  with two barriers
and two spaces between them. She would like to collect a fee But I ignored her and continued my direction .
I passed by a pagoda where it had a billboard selling a thing in porcelain. I guessed it should be broken to define a real porcelain thing. 
I have had a 4-day holiday at my boyfriend's hometown. My boyfriend spent his time at some parties with his friends. He got drunk. After
a party, he came home and found me. I saw my attitude was the same as my mother's when my father came home after a party. The

attitude is an uncomfortable feeling and a little angry. I used to hate this attitude from my mother and also wished I would not repeat it. 
Thank you very much

Dear Pro. Anthony and Vandana, 
The first DJ is a reminder for me on this spiritual way. Thank you for your guiding and sharing 
 . I
would like to share my dream interpretation this week. 
My mother and I came to check-in at a luxury beautiful hotel .   Firstly, we were in line with a

old friends  helped us bring our luggage to our room

She moved to the hotel lobby.  The friends and I asked the reason but she kept silent and found
something until my aunt  appeared. She was angry and left. 
I am practicing to recognize myself three positive things and one improved thing every day. It is not
easy for me. It also makes me less hard to others, now I still rarely appreciate or give compliment to
other people who do the good things. It is a journey and I continue to do it.

Wish you have a nice day!!!

Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana, 
This week, I feel better than last week after the story I told you. I accepted that the story reflected my
inner world which was unclear about my marriage so I met that case. I came back to work with the
question - "Marrying my boyfriend is the right decision?". I received a dream as below:
I would like to go to the toilet   knew that I could find that in my grandmother's room . I went to
that room . I saw the first grandmother  who was eating at a table  near the door. And the second
grandmother   was taking the toilet beside the room . I waited for the second grandmother. After going to the toilet, the second
grandmother came to the room and asked the first grandmother to clean her . The first grandmother was trying to complete her meal to
do it. I went to the toilet and it has not flushed . I pushed the button two or three times continuously. Suddenly my younger brother  and
an animal        sat on it. They made the toilet clogged   then the whirlpool was very strong then splashed out. When I ran out , I
remembered there was something near it. 
In another day, I had a dream as below:
I saw my male colleague He talked to me to focus the coffee   project by whispering . After that, I woke up at night. 
Thank you

Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana, 
After the seminar of Angel Jeliel, I came back to within more . I am so glad when I can remember the
below dream a lot. I also discovered some memories causing me trouble in my relationship. Firstly, I
would like to share my dream as below:   
I drove a motorbike with my female younger cousin to visit a beach in my hometown . 
I couldn't see clearly but I still tried to move. 
My cousin and I talked a lot about her trip with her parents before they came to my home. 
Then, we met two of my male friends - Ngoc and Hoang They also drove a motorbike. We greeted each other and talked, then we
continued our way. I thought too much, my sharing and my action is not enough so there is a discrepancy 
My cousin and I came to a place where her sister slept in an object on the beach. We woke her up. 
These days, I continue working with the angle on the intention of my boyfriend. We must be fit at 4 levels - spiritual, lectual, emotions and
physical. For me, they are still general. Could you explain to me in detail?

I also shared developing qualities, my learning DSSI, some things I learned from DSSI with my boyfriend. I asked him his opinion, he still
wants to marry me. I saw I didn't pay enough attention to him. He has good actions but I do not say anything, do not encourage, do not
record. I focus more on his wrong actions. I let my negative memories affect me a lot. I used to let my thoughts take control and this time,
I am studying and doing a way to let them go, to give myself and my boyfriend better taking care.  .
My boyfriend and I make love. My thought is always that he just wants my body when he does not take care of me enough  I am scared to
face it if it becomes true. The thought came to nature and last night, when it came, I observed it and understood it is one of the reasons
why I do not believe him fully, I did not record his other good actions, his personality. I just thought about my insecurity. 
Thank you
Duyen

Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana 
I would like to share my dream. I am asking the Up Above "is my boyfriend the right person for me in
this life?". Is it right to ask too much one question? 
I use a masculine wooden ruler   fly with my female friend . It was like a broomstick We went
through a forest to somewhere. THEN I lost her so I came back to find my friend. 
The dream shows me the uncomfortable part I am trying to avoid doing that. It causes myself the
inside too much thought, too much emotion. As I shared I thought negatively too much, I used to force myself to do something instead of
analyzing the meaning of my thoughts. It was a wrong way because it is still there without fixing. In meditation, I can focus on one
thought and find the memories causing that to fix. 
I have not met my friend in a long time. She used to be one of my best friends. We spent our time in our childhood. Once, she and
another friend misunderstood each other. I knew the reason so I explained the story to the friend to help them fix their relationship. My
friend knew that so she thought I was a talkative, unreliable friend and she did not want to meet me anymore. Although I apologized to
her, she did not accept. We didn't meet anymore from that. 
My parents have just called me and asked me an option for my relationship. My family want us to organize a pre-wedding party at my
home on the day a feng shui master told for our couple. I have not received the answer from the Up Above so I do not follow that fully. I
just let my boyfriend know that. I do not dare to share I am waiting for the answer from the Up Above. I only delay and delay. 

I saw myself putting my attention to my boyfriend too much. I always put all of my priorities for him. I schedule my time following his
schedule. It is not right. I like to stand by him. What should I do to fix it? Because it is unbalanced. 
Thank you

Dear Prof Anthony And Sis Vandana 
How are you? Is everything okay? I have not contacted you since our scheduled meeting at 5:30 p.m.
12.10.2022.
This week the Up Above gives me an opportunity to work with the Angel Chavakiah. I see the
synchronization from the Up Above in this week.
My brother is getting married in 2019. He keeps a relationship with a woman in chat, not his wife
from a long time. His wife knew that and she felt unacceptable. She heard the story from the sister of the woman. And she also saw
some messages from my brother's phone. She felt terrible and angry, so she shared it with me. Until now, my brother and she have not
solved it clearly. Besides, my sister-in-law is pregnant. My family wants my brother to take a trip to HCM city to check his health. But my
sister-in-law did not want that, she said my family made the decision without discussing it with her. She thought he just found a reason to
gather with his friends. She was so angry. Then my brother must delay his trip. 
I also received a dream as below:
I shared with my mother many kinds of sweet soups . 
Besides, last night, I also caught the card of Angel Chavakhiah and it reminded me to continue working with it. 

I look forward to hearing from you soon,
Thank you

Dear Prof Anthony And Sis Vandana 
I am glad to hear that everything is okay. I set a new schedule at 5:00 p.m. 25/10 for our meeting. I
hope you can fix that. 
I would like to share my story this week. At the end of last week, after setting up basically the coffee
store all day, I felt tired, exhausted and terrible. I would like to stop working. When I shared my
feelings and my work with my mother, she told me this was a job I chose and I was silly choosing
that. The job does not belong to my major. Besides, some old colleagues also told me the job is more
simple than my ability. I also felt alone when I could not share with anyone. I reminded myself the
purpose of working is developing quality. My feelings at that time were so strong. I cried a lot. I shared them with my boyfriend and he
encouraged me to continue because the job will let me study how to manage a store, staffs. I hugged myself softly. 
The next day I continued working in my tired body. My mind still had a thought about quitting the job. It lasted two days then I became
more comfortable. I have not found the memories causing that. 
Last night, I got a dream as below
I was on the way to my grandfather's house . Then I drove around an area two times .   I put a male stranger  But I avoided him.  I
moved to my female friend's house .

Dream and analysis: 
Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana 
I have just left a party in the middle when most of the members drank beers and I chose to drink
pure water. I am happy because no one pushes me to drink beer. I didn't belong to that. I did not
know which subject I could share with them. I kept silent and smiled.
This week, I had a date with two girlfriends. We had a dinner meal in a vegetarian restaurant. One of
them talked a lot about what another friend and I should do and live in this life esp marriage. I did
not feel comfortable because the conversation was more negative. She tried to push us to take
action. But another friend and I needed to have more time to make decisions under our natural
speed. I observed it, I felt uncomfortable but I knew if I tried to talk at this time, my tone was not
good. I would protect myself. I chose to listen and understand I used to put my opinions on others. My energy went down after the date. I
should be careful in a conversation. Sometimes I can take energy from others. She had a difficult period when she must show her ability
to prove herself in her work. She is a part of myself which is trying to put other parts following. I am too hard on myself. I continue to
work with myself, to give more love to myself and respect others' opinions. , she is on her Besides journey so I should respect it. 
I would like to share my dream of this week as below:
I and my relatives sat and had a party at my grandfather's house  together . I sat next to my grandfather. One relative constantly
speaks provokingly to me . I felt angry. I throw a bowl  four times to remind him.   At the end of the party my grandfather told me a story

from yesterday . My relatives asked a feng shui master about their good day but no one asked for me  . He asked for me . My good day is
December 14th according to the Lunar Calendar . Then he left. I stayed to clean. I did while I cried. I felt sad because no one took care
of me. My cousin asked for help from me. But I rejected him. 
I cried in reality after this dream. I was reminded Evil is education. The negative dream shows the thing I should work. 
Thank you

Dear Prof. Anthony and Vandana, 
Thank you for your encouragement. I would like to share my dream interpretation as below:
I woke up at my cousin's house  Her parents went aboard . I got out of the house and met her.  I
invited her to discover the lake near her house. The lake spread in a large area with many large
stones .  My cousin had a little bit postponed but she still wanted to go. I came back to change from
my dress to my pants for the trip.   was dirt road houses after the stones  .  We stopped at a house
having vines the way.   I fell unconscious and woke up tomorrow morning but my cousin left me at
that house and come back. The owner took me to the beginning point by horse
The next case, I hold my baby  in line to meet a man doctor .  In the line, I saw my boyfriend ,
some women and some children.   My boyfriend was like a stranger. I loved my fragile child.   My
mother and my cousin appeared.  There was an accident, a man wearing a white shirt without pants
somersaulted. He wasn't hurt but his face was a little silly. Many people moved to watch but I came
back to take care of my child. The doctor reminded me to apply for my medical record I gave my
child to my mother before he took my blood from my hand.  My cousin waited too long so she gave a reason for changing oil for our
motorbike to let us come home but the doctor didn't and he gave her some money for changing oil near the place. 

Many memories I accumulated effect to my definition. I have a trouble to define it is plus or minus because I am scared to be criticized of
course I criticize others too much
Thank you.

Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana, 
I would like to share with you one of the dreams from Up Above when I keep asking if my boyfriend
is the right person.
I came to a relative's house (I just felt that) . The house had a bathroom for a woman in another
house A man and I were in front of our house. He confessed his love to me. I was happy and
confused because I also had feelings for him and I was in a relationship with my present boyfriend. I
didn't say anything to him.  
I came into the house. I met 3 female friends going to play  badminton .
Then the man and his male friend came into the house to take a shower . He tries to show his erect penis  to me before going into the
bathroom. At that moment, my brother was also there.  
I went out of the house to move to the bathroom for women. I didn't remember exactly where the bathroom was.   I went into the wrong
house   where I saw a female was sleeping with a very cold atmosphere from the referee  She woke up and saw me. I apologized to her .
She presented the cute things which she was selling I promised to buy them later. Then I went down her staircase. I realized I was lost, I
forgot the relative's house. 

Thank you for your guide. I feel more touched when I have learned more about the dream. The message from Up Above is so profound,
the root cause of my matter.

Dream and analysis: 
Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana
The dream was interpreted by you so profoundly. I am not sure about my feelings for my boyfriend. I
am not sure I want him to become my husband or a father of my children. Sometimes I want,
sometimes, I don't want. I usually arrange my schedule to spend my time with him rather than with
my friend or myself. He schedules and spends his time playing football, having parties with his
colleagues, his friends. I asked myself what kind of our relationship is, what our common things are. 
Sometimes, we walk in a park, visit his relatives but our topic is so limited. Besides, he has never discussed our future plans. Sometimes I
asked him about our marriage. He told me he needed more time. I do not know whether I should talk about this topic because I have not
received the guide from Up Above so I avoided mentioning it. This week, Prof Kaya will decode dreams via zoom. I had an opportunity to
join with 2 friends. But I have not shown my invitation to my boyfriend. I hope that we can share the same topic related to symbolic
language with the life purpose of developing qualities. Going to within, I am scared to be alone. It is one of the reasons why I do not want
to lose him. 
This week, my work is not easy. My staff for the coffee store are sick and I spend most of my time working in the coffee store. I found
more staff to expand the business but I have not found out. I should develop the business but it is not easy. I want to give up. I give
myself the reason related to spiritual way. Then I remind myself the life purpose.   This situation helps me not to be too airy, more
realistic. 
I would like to share my dream this week:

My boyfriend and I were in my room in my house . He did not wear clothes .   We went out of the room to go somewhere. My
grandfather and my father saw us.  He came back to my room. I talked with them about my boyfriend. They advised me not to do that. 
Thank you a lot to be by my side, ...

Dear Prof Anthony and Dr. Mayur
Thank you for your encouragement in the 1st PR.
These days, I have not slept well. I am easy to wake up at midnight. I felt uncomfortable, and tired in
the morning. It likes I have a sleep from midnight and I have not slept enough. There are something
raising from my unconsciousness and I should accept it and meditate with the Mantra to understand
it .
This week, I asked the Up Above whether it is the right time to change my job. I want to share my
dream I received this week:
I went to my relative's house  on my boyfriend motorbike . I drove while my friends rode a bicycle.     The road was terrible. 
I have not come to a specific point. I'm coming back. On my way, there was a point - a low wall . My motorbike could not cross and I
should find another road. Two old women wanted me to put my motorbike next to the wall to let them climb over it, but I rejected it.
They could climb on its ledges. 
I continue my way. Suddenly I found that the license plate was lost. I must go on the previous track. 

Then I saw the place I crossed but now it was closed to motorbikes. I stopped it. One of the two women kicked the ball to my face . She
didn't say sorry. I was angry and shouted at her.  
Thank you
Duyen

Dream and analysis: 
Dear Prof. Anthony and Dr. Mayur 
I lost my sleep tonight. A lot of thoughts come to me. I felt tired and wanted to sleep back. I do not
feel at ease at this time. I saw many problems in me. I want to become better in every aspect of my
life. I separate my life into some fields like my work (What I can do, What should I move in the next
step), my physical body (my skin sick and nose sick), my couple relationship (my marriage), my friend
relationship (some friends have trouble and they are learning spiritual)... I stick to them. I am trying
to fix all of them as quickly as possible. I ask for help from everyone except myself to find an easy
way to all of my problems. I am escaping my life. All my problems are not from the outside. They
come from my heart. I just remember that they are one from a teacher. They are different
experiences to help me evolve qualities and purify my distortions. I should come back.
I want to share my dream this week:
I, my boyfriend , her younger sister , his cousin-sister , and his cousin-sister's daughter were in a strange place. .  The sister, the
cousin, the daughter, and I went along a lake . I made the daughter fall into the lake. The baby did not know how to swim. We didn't
know how to swim. So we went near the lake and blared to find help. No one appeared.   The daughter was taken near the bank. The
cousin took her up. The sister said it was my fault. My boyfriend came to the daughter. He didn't notice me. I felt guilty and angry when I
left. 

I am also thinking whether the right time to leave my present job. I shared my thoughts with my manager. He gave me one week to think
about it carefully. Because this time is not good to change. My director wants to help me when she heard that I have a question from my
colleague. I said it was another time. I notice a point. I am not ready to exchange my opinion with my director.  There is a space and I
asked myself the reason why I felt that. She is an excellent person in business. She runs her previous factory very well under government
laws. She taught my manager very well. She is finding some new projects to expand her business after leaving the factory. I rarely talk
with her. Everyone has a life program. I am not right when I looked at her results at the physical level. I should respect her rightly and
recognize her qualities and distortions. , I am just besides trying to escape my work more than developing my quality.    
Thank you

Dear Prof Anthony and Dr Mayur 
I met a person who is a master in I Ching. He gave me some primary information about my
personality, strengths, and weaknesses depending on my birthday. He applied not only the East's
but also the West's knowledge. The most important thing I should do first is to find my core values.
He guided me on some ways to find that like reading I Ching or Buddhist books. And I thought that it
is developing qualities from UCM last year. These qualities are my core values and they help me
make decisions. Do I understand rightly?
I would like to share the dream I received before my above meeting as below:
I met the person  at a place. When he shared a part of myself, he called my female friend - my high schoolmate to join our meeting.
From that point, he taught her his job and ignored me.  There was a friend  which went around the place. Then he went out. We moved to
another room. He came back with low energy so he could not share anything with me.

Dear Prof Anthony and Dr. Mayur 
I would like to send my dream this week
I was in a school . The school was too strict 
Firstly, Some friends and I investigated the death of a beautiful girl  our school. I was chased when
I tried to solve it. 
Secondly, my class had almost started but I had not brushed my teeth . I moved out of the
classroom to go to the toilet. I moved the movable barrier to get out. But the time was over, so I returned to the class without brushing
my teeth. 
I received a message to move to another better class I have not solved my problem, I have a superior thought, so I moved to another matter . 
My female teacher checked the message before letting me out.  I went to the new class. In the front of the class, I saw some students
who were punished. The male teacher did not want to receive me because the class was full. But I was still there. 
, I had another dream Besides that I was being chased by something. I wanted to solve it, so I stopped and fought against it. My way was
not right, and I died. How can I solve a case in a dream? We will have many cases and many solutions. No patterns for something, right?

Dear Prof Anthony and Dr. Mayur 
I would like to share my dream as below:
I traveled with my boyfriend's company . We lived in an old boarding house. 
The first scene, my boyfriend and I brought the bicycle to the house. There was a helpful woman
who kept it for us. But I was worried it might be lost and I would like to go somewhere by it so I came back to take it. She said it was
locked in a room. A female cleaner brought the key. 
A couple in my boyfriend's team invited me to go out. I got a stomachache, so I went back to a toilet. 
His female colleagues lived full a room so I should move to another room. When I had just sat on the toilet, my boyfriend opened the
small glass door and talked to me. I felt shy so I requested him close it. Then other people came to my room. I was so shy and I wanted
them to leave. But one man said his bathroom was damaged .

Dear Prof Anthony and Sis. Vandana, 
Your revising my dreams is so great 
 . I am encouraged to face difficult memories by compassion,
love, wisdom ... Thank you very much. Last night, I spent my time watching two series of Korea with
two multiples at speed. The contents were not good, the characters fell in love and had sexuality too
fast or they had sexuality without love. I slept around 11:45 p.m. and woke up around 3 am. I was
affected by two films. I did not make a good choice for my soul. 
I would like to share a dream for this week. This dream appeared when I watched the Good Doctors
on Netflix
After school, I went to the library where Dr. Glassman is a bookkeeper. I was looking for my name in a newspaper . I also felt that I
almost found that. But I have not seen it. Some friends had the same purpose as me.   Then a person, Hoang , found the newspaper
having his name.   We finding continued over lunch. Dr. Glassman went to take the lunch and reminded us of having lunch. I still paid
attention to finding it in anger because I nearly had it. I would do it quickly to come home and my mother would not be angry with me.
After looking for a long time, I felt hungry so I stopped to eat.   I came out and met Dr. Glassman came back, I also saw our school was
preparing for the final meeting. I saw many teachers were walking. One of them was Nhan , a homeroom teacher. He was coming back to
the room for homeroom teachers. I remembered I have not completed the exercises from Dr. Glassman. He gave them to me at the end
of this morning. I continued looking for the newspaper.   I brought high newspapers on a window to check but nothing. I realized the
exercises are more important than looking. 

Thank you for being here

Dear Prof. Anthony and Sis. Vandana, 
I hope you have a nice day! I would like to share a dream which I asked the Universe if the job was fit
for my evolution. The dream is as below:
My father and I went to a cinema by motorbike.   We stopped at the parking lot which was
opposite the cinema and at the foot-slope.  There were two female street vendors offering us food
and drink too much. Then we agreed to buy and we ate there. 
 My father suddenly wanted to
gamble with the lotteries  of the vendor. He lost. When everything becomes difficult, I will just do a new
thing with a hope of luck and lack of going deeply to clean the negative memories.    After eating, my
father and I left the waste for the vendor We also received a reminder of cleaning from a female
guard standing far from us but we still continued. The vendor did not clean and left. 
My mother and I went to a cinema by motorbike. Inside of me, I continue comparing myself with
others.  An old girlfriend appeared and went with us.  My ex-boyfriend wanted to meet me but I
rejected and he followed us . My mother and I left our motorbike at a parking lot and walked to the cinema. The cinema was crowded.
There were many people walking too.   The old girlfriend told me a story about my ex-boyfriend. When I was taken to a country, he
betrayed this country to take me back .   My mother and I saw a crowd. I saw my boyfriend fixing his motorbike with my brother. The
motorbike has a chain trouble.   He tried to watch the movie with us. Two girl strangers  told me his other problem - crossing the red
light and getting punished. I was angry because he didn't tell me.   Before bringing his motorbike to be fixed, he and I came to the cinema

to buy a ticket for him. I did not want him to watch because I did not want him to see my ex-boyfriend.   At the main door, there was a
stranger who gave us a ticket - 30 thousand VND. I realized my ex-boyfriend was behind the scene. I rejected buying  My boyfriend and I
came to the ticket office. There were 2 women who sold the tickets for a couple 
Thank you very much,

My boyfriend and I came into a forest to challenge our abilities to join the nation .  We went to a
waterfall with a guide to test the ability to use bows . My boyfriend went somewhere so the guide
and I waited at a big stone .
Then my boyfriend and I lived in an old, abandoned abandoned building with some people.  When
a group of people came to our place to provoke, the men moved to another building to fight the
group.   I had the intention to fight but the men did not accept because I was a woman.  A man from
the group was lost, he loved a girl from our place so he decided to live in our place.
I took a walk around a lake with a girl . Her boyfriend came and said sorry to her because he could not keep his promise. She was angry
and came back to her room.  
Then the men fighting won.They brought back the spoilers  I came back to my room was avoiding a person who was leading a bear so I
came into a room which was near my room and was raising a lion cub . I was started.   I threatened the lion so it wouldn't bite me. 
A girl and I ran into a forest to hide and then we went baking.

Dear Prof. Anthony and Sis. Vandana, 
Dreams are so deep. Every of your guides lets me know which memory I keep. It is not easy to accept
and sometimes, I feel impatient.  
Today, I would like to share you a dream as below:
I was normal on the way from my company to my rented room .  The police caught me so I found
another way. .   I felt hesitant when I drove into a strange road    I saw my brother and some people
crossing me. I followed them and I drove to the end of that road. It was a government building.  I
drove up some floors by stairs but I could not find the way out.  I had the intention to fly across a wall.   Finally, I ran to the back of the
building to get out. The owner of this building caught and asked me. I was very annoyed. I was wrong but still stiff, uncooperative. 
Thank you
Duyen

Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana, 
I would like to share a though with you. My boyfriend and I will have a 2-day trip in a cold area with
four couples of my friends. Everytime, I mentioned to buy a warm cloth. He replied he didn't need it,
he could hug me when he slept. I just thought it was a kidding. Then a couple of my friends joined
the trip. There is a long time we do not contact. I feel I don't like it. I would feel alone, lost if I was
with them. I see a pattern every time I meet a group, I will be too emissive to get attention. The
group is bigger, I feel more difficult. The more they pay attention to me, the more I feel happy. After
realizing, I come back to recognize myself and give myself a courage to pass the old pattern. I also understand the meaning of the
sentence my boyfriend shared. He is not confident in my groups and I will courage him too. How do you think about it? 
Here is my dream for this week
Three families had an appointment at my grandfather's house  Three fathers had a good relationship. They chatted and had some
games together. This was the last time for all of them.
One of three families only had a father, 2 daughters and a cat . The father would go somewhere, one daughter would buy rice with the
mother for donation, one daughter would go somewhere then come back to meet the mother. ..  . I was the final person leaving   When I
had just left in the afternoon, I saw the cat in the room. I push the cat coming out because this room would close too long, the cat would
die when it did not have food The cat came out of this room but it did not come out of the house . But I saw a way to get out for the cat so

I let it there. It clung to me and didn't want to break up. I met a friend who came and chatted with him a little. Then I came to another part
of this house and met my cousin who I really liked.I share the appointment with him and leave.  I do not realize the meaning of the final
scene. The friend I see is a stranger. He is a man. Is it a part from my unconscious related to my action, a strange action? The cousin is a man too,
but I do not remember who he is, I just know I really like him. I come back to my old behavior? Waiting for your sharing  
Thank you
Duyen

Dear Prof. Anthony and Ms. Vandana 
There was a special evening within my trip last week when I was working with angel Achaiah about
"is my work place suitable with my life program?". I experienced camping in a higher land with my friends. 12 members separated to 3
camps. We made BBQ with alcohol. We drank too much. 
One of my friends got tired because of his heart. I felt so worried. He went to sleep. 
My boyfriend gave me some advice to stop drinking. I cried and said I was strong enough to drink more and asked him why he did not
believe me. 
After that, I shared a part of my feeling from my past to my best friend related to the tired friend. I fell asleep quickly and cannot
remember anything from that time.  
Around 4 am, one of our teams screamed because she had a nightmare - she was betrayed by her husband. Just three people came and
helped her. Others were sleeping. In the morning, she remembers her dream. Some friends believed it was caused by a bad ghost living
in that area. We should greet when we come to a strange place. 
I would like to share you my dream as below: 
I came to a food store which had a large sitting area  with 2 men and 1 woman . We were choosing our food. I was watching fish dishes
and I chose a fried fish that was too dried and crispy. Others were still choosing and giving me money  to make payment. 

We saw our enemy  We ran away. I hid below a table . The enemy is a woman wearing black clothes . She caught me. . I left money on the
table to pay for our food.
I was released and returned to the base. I talked with my boss then I came back to my place. ...I met my boyfriend and he hugged me and
said we were alone.
Thank you
Duyen
