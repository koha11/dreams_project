file: A weird proposal; last dream id: D0000; Date of dream: Tuesday, February 15, 2022 Angel: 18 Caliel State of mind: Surprised, Angry, Afraid, Disappoited Dream and analysis: Good morning, my professor and assistant professor! Thank you for guiding me on this journey. I worked with the angel Caliel with the important question: "Is my boyfriend a husband fit for my developing quality" (I have asked it for two months) Here is my first dream: My boyfriend and I came back to his home - not his present house. His family had dinner but we have not eaten . I prepared the meal for both of us. His younger sister showed me the place to take the food. The preparation was nearly completed with a lack of fish sauce so he was taking it. I went down to the ground floor while he was on the high floor . Then he finished making fish sauce, I went up without his call. When I am on the highest floor, he and my old girlfriend swinged down by rope and he dropped the friend off. He intended to ask me to marry but I was at the beginning position and I was looking down. The second dream: "I was attacked by a white strong light from both sides when I ran after a friend I could not open my eyes . I did Tai Chi weakly before I fainted." I am too strict on myself, it prevents me from receiving the reality related to 2 polarities. The third dream: " My friend, Y and I discovered a white strange paint stain falling down from the roof when my paternal family gathered to celebrate flew down to find us but we escaped so it flew away. A next scene, a white paint stain from the roof fell down on some children , they just dissolved, a big creature attacked, luckily a man hit the creature and it disappeared. A next scent, when the family gathered in the attic , my mother and I saw a paint stain, and I announced dissolving immediately. Everyone except I and Y ran to the door . We hid to the back, jumped to other roofs to hide and find the signal of the creature. Some of the adults also found it when he was preparing to attack but it ran away in our way. I was protected by my cousin when I was on the roof. Then, I was on the way back home . I have just been on a bridge then a big water flowed and brought a big shark . I held the bridge and pretended to die and escaped. When I was at home, I decided to pick my lover up to my house to have dinner. His home is in a military area . It used to be a school where I spent my time when I was a child. I guaranteed to protect him and I believed I can do it. When I crossed the military school, it was a big wind but I still took him to his home." Third dream is "I was in a class and prepared for an examination . A woman teacher guided me using a cow replace a pig for the examination ." Fourth dream is " a registration of marriage " There are some memories let me leave off the spiritual way. Fifth dream is "I, Oanh Quang , Nguyen and some friends gathered at a place on a floor to chat and then moved to a party . We needed to walk to the party. The street was like a street coming to . There were. many groups dressed in different clothes . I was suddenly called from a group. The group is 3 girls wearing hoodies . I was invited to dance together with them on the platform. Then I moved to another place. All my friends disappeared . I knew they were coming back in the first place, I was waiting for them in anger. After a long time, they rode across me to leave." Thank you very much.

file: Discovery; last dream id: D0006; Date of dream: Saturday, November 25, 2023 Angel: 32 Vasariah State of mind: Afraid Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Prof Anthony and Dr Mayur, In the past few days, I felt uncomfortable in the left jaw when yawning and I constantly sneezed and had a runny nose because of allergic rhinitis. I often wake up at night because I can't breathe smoothly and need to sneeze. Could you help me to explain this matter symbolically? I want to analyze this dream as below: I stayed in an unknown place where I would learn and live with my friends. I lost 2 times when I found a way to go to the toilet . The first time, I turned in the wrong direction The second time, I went with Tin - my old friend I was angry with him. We even went out of that place. Then we must use the main road to come back. In the next scene, my classroom has a short rest time. I was tired so I went to my room with two friends. Two friends still wanted to return to the class while I was lazy on my bed. In the next scene, there was a fight between two male friends and another in a room. They were hurt. Other people must find a way to take them to the hospital. One of the three friends called a female friend "a mother" so other people told her that it was the right choice, she was criticized. Yesterday, my boss shared our personalities when she was studying a course. She mentioned my pluses and my weakness - too much anger. Sometimes, my anger shows in my work strongly. I see a little bit of resistance when I get this information. Then I accept that it is a part of myself and I am on the way to improving. I have an opportunity to receive comments from my boss and my manager to become a better version. I am also careful not to repress my feelings. It is the final dream journal of this year. I am so grateful and thank you for your guidance, companionship, and patience...I get your explanation with your love and wisdom. It encourages me to step further on the spiritual journey. I wish that all the best things for you. Thank you Duyen
