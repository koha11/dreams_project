C01,D0011,01/05/2025,"I was sitting in a restaurant . There were two friends sitting in front of us and turning around to talk to us and two male friends sitting to my left. While we were there, I overheard something about an upcoming birthday but I wasn't sure whose it was. I also listened to some bad news but I couldn't remember. Eventually, a birthday cake appeared, and we all celebrated— it turned out to be for the male friend beside me, whose nickname was "" Mouse "". Another male friend joined in, pretending it was his birthday too, making everyone laugh. The atmosphere was joyful, and the male friend next to me—who felt like my boyfriend —was gentle and kind and I felt a warm connection between us. Later, the other male friend mentioned that he liked cheerful work, like the kind I do, and asked me to let him know if I heard of any similar job opportunities. That day, I met with some friends who are now very busy with their children. Even though they came to a gathering, they couldn't spend much time with the group. One of my friends called me by an ugly name many times, this time, I stood up for myself and told him not to speak to me that way, but he continued, and it exhausted me. During a short conversation, he asked what I had learned from DSSI and how I could prove my level. I felt uncomfortable. I didn't feel it was the right time or place to explain what I had learned, especially since he seemed focused only on concrete results. I refused to go into detail and kept evolving his questions, though apart from me feared that might damage our friendship. Finally, one of my friends wanted to share something she was passionate about and asked me to listen. But I started to sense that some of what she shared didn't feel right to me—it seemed to deny something negative or even harmful. I felt conflicted. I didn't think she would accept my perspective. I'm still unsure what the right thing is—for me or for her. I know she means well and wants to help, but I also know I need to be true to what I've learned and believe. Additionally, I hurt my right thumb twice recently, which reminded me how easy it is to judge others without seeing the full picture. Maybe what we see as someone's mistake is actually tied to a deeper story—or even karma from past lives. This helped me remember not to judge others. Coming home and observing the way my parents live I understand that there are some renunciations I should do deeply on myself and change myself, not changing others.",Comfortable,From PDF: Nourishing a Right Love

C01,D0015,15/05/2025,"Phap and another friend cycled past where I lived. I've also felt more connected to the love I receive in my life. For example, when some colleagues made mistakes, I initially felt frustrated and thought they should have been more careful. But instead of reacting, I stayed calm and shared my point of view gently. I've become more aware that I'm working with human beings, not robots, and that awareness makes me feel more connected to them. My mother recently reminded me that while I can be a vegetarian, I should consider eating what others eat in social situations, so I can be more easily accepted. At first, I might have resisted this advice, but now I understand it came from a place of love and concern. She's worried about me, and I no longer feel the need to argue like I used to. Instead, I appreciate her perspective and even encourage her to take care of her own health, especially since she was unhappy at the time. I respect the rhythm of my family and the wisdom it brings. I feel happy and softer than before. Of course, I'm still working on my insecurities — especially the desire for love and attention from others — but I'm starting to see that everything I seek already exists within me. And I'm learning to recognize and trust that more each day.",happy and softer than before,From PDF: file

I spoke to him that he should be the one driving me. This dream makes me think about how recently I am trying to make myself in work, I have a fear that if I do not do anything, I will be like a die, I will go down, I will not develop. So even when I want to watch something, I use the English video to help me learn it and become familiar with it. I think I can give myself a little time for breaking to breathe and doing the mantra. Relaxing in the right way is a good thing for my evolution. When I think about the symbol of my boyfriend in my dream, I realize that he is a part of me and he spends most of his time working. Even when his work is over, he can cut all of his time to just work and some basic activities for a long time. He just spent a little time on our relationship after he arranged for his sport, his party with his colleagues. I accept that he needs to relax when he works a lot like that. But his balance is not easy, even though he rarely calls his family. He thinks that he should earn money for the future of my parents, but when he comes back to his home with his family, he spends most of the time gathering and drinking beer.
