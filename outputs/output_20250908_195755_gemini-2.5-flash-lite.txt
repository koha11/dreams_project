file: A weird proposal; last dream id: D0000; Date of dream: Tuesday, February 15, 2022 Angel: 18 Caliel State of mind: Surprised, Angry, Afraid, Disappoited Dream and analysis: Good morning, my professor and assistant professor! Thank you for guiding me on this journey. I worked with the angel Caliel with the important question: "Is my boyfriend a husband fit for my developing quality" (I have asked it for two months) Here is my first dream: My boyfriend and I came back to his home - not his present house. His family had dinner but we have not eaten . I prepared the meal for both of us. His younger sister showed me the place to take the food. The preparation was nearly completed with a lack of fish sauce so he was taking it. I went down to the ground floor while he was on the high floor . Then he finished making fish sauce, I went up without his call. When I am on the highest floor, he and my old girlfriend swinged down by rope and he dropped the friend off. He intended to ask me to marry but I was at the beginning position and I was looking down. The second dream: "I was attacked by a white strong light from both sides when I ran after a friend I could not open my eyes . I did Tai Chi weakly before I fainted." I am too strict on myself, it prevents me from receiving the reality related to 2 polarities. The third dream: " My friend, Y and I discovered a white strange paint stain falling down from the roof when my paternal family gathered to celebrate flew down to find us but we escaped so it flew away. A next scene, a white paint stain from the roof fell down on some children , they just dissolved, a big creature attacked, luckily a man hit the creature and it disappeared. A next scent, when the family gathered in the attic , my mother and I saw a paint stain, and I announced dissolving immediately. Everyone except I and Y ran to the door . We hid to the back, jumped to other roofs to hide and find the signal of the creature. Some of the adults also found it when he was preparing to attack but it ran away in our way. I was protected by my cousin when I was on the roof. Then, I was on the way back home . I have just been on a bridge then a big water flowed and brought a big shark . I held the bridge and pretended to die and escaped. When I was at home, I decided to pick my lover up to my house to have dinner. His home is in a military area . It used to be a school where I spent my time when I was a child. I guaranteed to protect him and I believed I can do it. When I crossed the military school, it was a big wind but I still took him to his home." Third dream is "I was in a class and prepared for an examination . A woman teacher guided me using a cow replace a pig for the examination ." Fourth dream is " a registration of marriage " There are some memories let me leave off the spiritual way. Fifth dream is "I, Oanh Quang , Nguyen and some friends gathered at a place on a floor to chat and then moved to a party . We needed to walk to the party. The street was like a street coming to . There were. many groups dressed in different clothes . I was suddenly called from a group. The group is 3 girls wearing hoodies . I was invited to dance together with them on the platform. Then I moved to another place. All my friends disappeared . I knew they were coming back in the first place, I was waiting for them in anger. After a long time, they rode across me to leave." Thank you very much.

file: Binh Yen Noi campsite; last dream id: D0006; Date of dream: Thursday, May 5, 2022 Angel: 9 Haziel State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana Wish you have a nice day!!! This period time, I continue focusing to the question: "Is my present job still suitable for my life program?" I received some dreams from the Up-Above but I cannot remember. My company has a big change in the next time. My boss confirmed to sell our company. I can continue working at the present position. The new owner will invest and expand the company with a big mission. Is it a good sign for myself? I have not met the new owner. My manager told me the new owner was a rich group. Buying our company is just a small project. The company can join to a supply chain with other companies in the group. I think I should ask the Up Above to have an answer more clearly. I also noted a dream this week as below: 1. I came to Binh Yen Noi - in English, it means a peace place where I and my friends went camping as I told you in last dream journal. I came to take a birthday cake ..I reserved. 2. I was on the way coming to my company. I try a new way. I went up following 2 young men They gave up when they were in the middle of a slope. I felt the way was not right but I still wanted to try. I went to the highest of the slope and saw Binh Yen Noi . I told the waiter I was lost, he guided me went down because of no other ways. will be late at my work. I tried to run to my company . The company was in a building. I forgot bringing the elevator card I ran to the elevator and received the help from the guards. Coming in the company, I saw two men who were threatening me There were a man who we had a deep relationship and a man who I was in a love relationship. They were protecting me . Duyen Thank you

file: Vegetable Rows in a House; last dream id: D0008; Date of dream: Wednesday, April 2, 2025 Angel: 15 Hariel State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle, I would like to analyze this dream as below: I saw vegetable rows in a house , and I want to water them. There were Vy and Sao . I pulled the hose to water them, and had to go around in all sorts of ways. I also met a female water seller in front of the house, who didn't want me to pull the hose through her position because she felt it was quite annoying. She still let me pass. AS SAID ABOVE, Everyone told me to water them too much . The seller accidentally had an unexpected event at home and needed money. , so she asked Sao if he could pay back some of the money he owed. He went in and took out some of the water bottles to pay. That morning, before going to work, I dropped a small bottle of perfume on the ground. The bottle did not break, but a little spilled out. I did not realize that the perfume had spilled into the box of vegetables I cooked to bring to the company to eat. When I analyzed my dream, I asked myself how emotions ("water") can nourish emotions ("vegetables"). I did not realize that point consciously and it's time to work on that. It shows that I think too much more than I feel. Emotions are something that I have, but I didn't know how to nourish them. That is the reason why I am at the intellectual level more than at the emotional level. Sometimes, I just find a way to adjust my thoughts and then adjust my feelings. I also see that I do not notice my feelings enough, but I can discern my thoughts when it has a problem. This is one of the reasons making me have difficulty analyzing this dream. I asked myself: "How am I nourishing my emotions? Are emotions important to me?" There were some confusions in me for this topic. I realize that I am trying to go deeply into a topic instead of ignoring that. Thank you Duyen Reviewer's Message: A lovely hello Ân, I would like to share this interpretation with you, it took me a while to do it and I'm not completely sure. Angélique gratitude, Danièle 🙏🌸

file: A deny to connect; last dream id: D0009; Date of dream: Saturday, April 12, 2025 Angel: 44 Yelahiah State of mind: Uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle, I am so touched when I read your revision. Everything is synchronicity when I am working on my emotions with Angel Damabiah, then I receive your revisions. They help me understand myself at the emotional level. , I am on the Besides journey to research a scholarship to learn a Master's in Supply Chain Management in Europe. I want to dive deeply into the major. I have an intention to develop my patience, concentration, and perseverance. Because I discovered that I used to give up many times in learning English, it showed my difficulties in manifestation, and this year, I would like to understand it deeply. I spend every day writing down any subject like a journal, and I see myself giving many reasons not to do things, and I could persuade myself to do my best. I asked myself why I do not write down the beautiful things and the improved things I learned instead of giving up. The resistance is big and I need more time to understand it, coming from and transforming. When I practiced Yana breathing, I felt so heavy in my heart chakra. I tried to breathe through the heaviness, and at the end of this practice, I felt softer and had a strange feeling at my third chakra. I also heard a voice that why I need to force myself to breathe like this, I need to love myself, and do the soft things. I heard this voice many times, when I wanted to learn English deeply after working. The voice told me that I was forcing myself, I needed to respect my rhythm, so I do not make efforts, and I need to change to relax. And I also see my fear that I am not qualified enough to learn a Master's with a scholarship. But this time, I would like to learn to manifest in the right way, so I continue searching, learning English, and listening to Up Above's guidance through my dream and my concrete life. I was recently reminded by a DSSI friend that the spiritual journey is autonomy, I should be careful not to have a dependency on Up Above like I pray, but I do not move my feet. I would like to analyze a dream when I invoked the Angel Yelahiah - my emotional birth angel and I would like to understand why I refuse to face a conflict: I sat down with Ai somewhere. I needed to contact Bang Tuyen urgently in my hometown, because I was careless and gave the wrong information to Tuyen. When Ai knew my fault, she was very angry and required me to fix it immediately. She even started calling and gave the phone to me. But on the other side, some people were joking, so they did not reply . I was uncomfortable, and I asked her to turn off the call, and I would call again later. The previous morning, Ai was a person who asked me whether my relationship with my ex-boyfriend continued or not. Because she and another female friend wanted to kick him out of my friends' chat group that we had been added to. I said he and I stopped, and she could do what she wanted. I asked myself if it was right. He came to my friends' group, but he can be our friend even though he and I broke up. I think I am growing more and more when I improve my concentration and patience in doing the right things. Of course, it can not lack love, but it also has to have the right rigor. Thank you Duyen Reviewer's Message: A lovely hello, An, thank you for your help and comments. I would like to send you this review, as well as for the advice given. Angelic thoughts, Danielle 🙏

I would like to analyze my dream: I was sitting in a restaurant . There were two friends sitting in front of us and turning around to talk to us and two male friends sitting to my left. While we were there, I overheard something about an upcoming birthday but I wasn't sure whose it was. I also listened to some bad news but I couldn't remember. Eventually, a birthday cake appeared, and we all celebrated— it turned out to be for the male friend beside me, whose nickname was " Mouse ". Another male friend joined in, pretending it was his birthday too, making everyone laugh. The atmosphere was joyful, and the male friend next to me—who felt like my boyfriend —was gentle and kind and I felt a warm connection between us. Later, the other male friend mentioned that he liked cheerful work, like the kind I do, and asked me to let him know if I heard of any similar job opportunities. That day, I met with some friends who are now very busy with their children. Even though they came to a gathering, they couldn't spend much time with the group. One of my friends called me by an ugly name many times, this time, I stood up for myself and told him not to speak to me that way, but he continued, and it exhausted me. During a short conversation, he asked what I had learned from DSSI and how I could prove my level. I felt uncomfortable. I didn't feel it was the right time or place to explain what I had learned, especially since he seemed focused only on concrete results. I refused to go into detail and kept evolving his questions, though apart from me feared that might damage our friendship. Finally, one of my friends wanted to share something she was passionate about and asked me to listen. But I started to sense that some of what she shared didn't feel right to me—it seemed to deny something negative or even harmful. I felt conflicted. I didn't think she would accept my perspective. I'm still unsure what the right thing is—for me or for her. I know she means well and wants to help, but I also know I need to be true to what I've learned and believe. Additionally, I hurt my right thumb twice recently, which reminded me how easy it is to judge others without seeing the full picture. Maybe what we see as someone's mistake is actually tied to a deeper story—or even karma from past lives. This helped me remember not to judge others. Coming home and observing the way my parents live I understand that there are some renunciations I should do deeply on myself and change myself, not changing others. THANK YOU Duyen Reviewer's Message: A lovely hello, An. I'd like to send you this review for the advice you gave. Thank you for your help; I'm learning a lot of practical things with Duyen. Angelic thoughts, Danielle 🙏

To see my niece, Cat, I passed by and looked into. Dream 2 : When I lived with a friend In my countryside, . I unintentionally scared a male friend who felt I was harassing him. I didn't explain because I mistakenly thought it was just because he was handsome. Dream 3: I was sitting at the dining table with Quang , Hoang . Then Oanh came in and wanted me to decode her dream. Hoang's attitude is very unpleasant. Dream 4 : Phap and another friend cycled past where I lived. I've also felt more connected to the love I receive in my life. For example, when some colleagues made mistakes, I initially felt frustrated and thought they should have been more careful. But instead of reacting, I stayed calm and shared my point of view gently. I've become more aware that I'm working with human beings, not robots, and that awareness makes me feel more connected to them. My mother recently reminded me that while I can be a vegetarian, I should consider eating what others eat in social situations, so I can be more easily accepted. At first, I might have resisted this advice, but now I understand it came from a place of love and concern. She's worried about me, and I no longer feel the need to argue like I used to. Instead, I appreciate her perspective and even encourage her to take care of her own health, especially since she was unhappy at the time. I respect the rhythm of my family and the wisdom it brings. I feel happy and softer than before. Of course, I'm still working on my insecurities — especially the desire for love and attention from others — but I'm starting to see that everything I seek already exists within me. And I'm learning to recognize and trust that more each day. THANK YOU Duyen Reviewer's Message: A beautiful hello Ân, Short dreams, very subtle, for his guidance. I didn't note the niece's name "Cat", I imagine she dreams in Vietnamese, to avoid creating a judgment. Even if in the next dream we still see a bit of cat-like behavior. Angélique gratitude 🙏🌸, Danièle

file: Restructure; last dream id: D0015; Date of dream: Friday, May 30, 2025 Angel: 68 Habuhiah Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle This week, I achieved significant efficiency by restructuring my coffee business. A team member suggested a better salary, prompting me to reconsider. After discussions with my boss and manager, I implemented a new KPI and Revenue structure for my coffee team, offering increased bonuses for goal achievement. Other new structures were also introduced. While not exactly what she expected, it confirmed I had listened to her concerns. I reflected on why this weighed so heavily on me, realizing my appreciation for her efforts in the store. However, I recognized a need to improve how I manifest my intentions. I must commit to following my structure, including random task evaluations, which will offer a new perspective to the team. I need to act more as a manager and less as just a guide. I accept who I am and will do my best. I also found myself frustrated with a supplier who repeatedly made the same mistake. Attempts to explain were met with refusal, leading to monthly errors. I realized my energy is stronger now, and I questioned whether I could change her or if a different approach would yield better results. I need to use the right energy to communicate with her. I felt paralyzed when I realized I only had a week to submit my exercises. While I made progress this month—preparing the PR early, the Source Code in the middle, and the Angelica Yantra at the beginning—leaving me with less work, I was still exhausted this week. To counter this, I dedicated one evening to meditation and relaxation, simply lying down without doing anything. I understand this exhaustion is an accumulation of memories, and I am learning to transform them. I would like to analyze this dream: The large campus featured a study area and a residential zone, divided by a stream. I ARRIVED early, hoping to rent a temporary room for a nap However, upon entering the right building , I found every room occupied. I spoke with the female manager , alongside two other girls, also seeking accommodation. She informed me that rooms were only rented monthly and that this was the male section. She then led the two girls to the female area across the way. I sensed her discomfort with my presence, but thankfully, one of the girls pulled me along. On the other side, the other male manager said something like There were no rooms available. I saw Ngan there, though she seemed unfamiliar. Then I left. I stopped by the food court and ran into several old friends, both male and female, whom I hadn't seen in a while. They were enjoying themselves at the counter, picking out food, chatting before heading off. I was in another scene, like in a class, and there was a reaction related to lightning . I recently had a dream where I was driving my ex-boyfriend to his company, making a right turn. It felt like a stark reminder that I'm repeating old patterns. I spoke to him that he should be the one driving me. This dream makes me think about how recently I am trying to make myself in work, I have a fear that if I do not do anything, I will be like a die, I will go down, I will not develop. So even when I want to watch something, I use the English video to help me learn it and become familiar with it. I think I can give myself a little time for breaking to breathe and doing the mantra. Relaxing in the right way is a good thing for my evolution. When I think about the symbol of my boyfriend in my dream, I realize that he is a part of me and he spends most of his time working. Even when his work is over, he can cut all of his time to just work and some basic activities for a long time. He just spent a little time on our relationship after he arranged for his sport, his party with his colleagues. I accept that he needs to relax when he works a lot like that. But his balance is not easy, even though he rarely calls his family. He thinks that he should earn money for the future of my parents, but when he comes back to his home with his family, he spends most of the time gathering and drinking beer. His mother told me that he did not share anything." This dream resonated with something I learned from a video about a book, which described a teacher asking four-year-old students if they wanted to repeat the same lesson or try something new. A portion of them chose the familiar option, and I realized I have a similar tendency to stick with what's comfortable, indicating a difficulty in embracing new challenges to learn step by step. Thank you Duyen Reviewer's Message: A lovely hello, Ân. I'm sorry to send you so many validations; I do it less often for other students. Angélique, gratitude, Danièle

file: A Box of Butterflies; last dream id: D0019; Date of dream: Saturday, June 7, 2025 Angel: 44 Yelahiah Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle Initially, I read this dream in Vietnamese in my journal, but I couldn't understand what happened, so I chose something else. However, when I returned to select a dream again, I understood this one and would like to analyze it. There's something crucial I need to grasp because while working with my emotional birth angel Yelahiah, I've noticed continued resistance. I even avoid sleeping well and struggle to remember my dreams in detail. My friends came over to my place, including Dieu and her second son , who could already talk, plus two or three other friends . We were doing something when her son wanted to leave . I went to the convenience store to buy something. Then I called a ride for her and her son. When the car arrived, she and her sat in the back with a large car seat . They sat next to another passenger. The car dropped that person off first, then her and her son. After I got back and we continued hanging out, I suddenly remembered I had a meeting at 2 PM that I'd completely forgotten about. A friend even messaged me asking why I wasn't online. I thought to myself, if I'd remembered, I wouldn't have been goofing around like this. Then I noticed the bedroom had a display box on the wall filled with butterflies and other winged insects I'd forgotten to clean it out. Before I could even touch it, they all flew out. This week, I've been reflecting on my struggle with sharing and having deep conversations, one of my ex-boyfriend symbol's distortions that I had a resonance with. Diving deeper, I realized a root cause lies in my childhood: during a conflict with my brother, my mom told me to "keep silent, don't say anything." This left me crying uncontrollably, trying to make no sound. This experience created a shadow, leading me to withhold problems from my parents, even in the abuse cases I've mentioned. To this day, they remain unaware of what happened to me. This has formed a blocking within me, preventing me from sharing any feelings. Additionally, I'm now more prone to realizing my own actions, sometimes fearing that current issues, if repeated, could create similar future blockages. Additionally, I've felt itchy and my nose has been stiff ever since hearing about a dream of a man's infidelity. I find that it comes from my resonances when I do not follow my principles. I also need to work on it. THANK YOU Duyen Reviewer's Message: A lovely hello, An, I would like to send you these tips. I wasn't sure if we should bring up the question of whether she could communicate with her parents. But with a program where she has never said things, she might be led to do so. I thought that Heaven will send her dreams and that it might not be necessary to bring up the subject now. What do you think? Thank you with all my heart, Angélique, Danièle Angelic thoughts from the bottom of my heart dear DANIèlE, thank you for the beautiful review,

file: An investment; last dream id: D0022; Date of dream: Friday, May 27, 2022 Angel: 36 Menadel State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana, This week, I am busy working more than normal to prepare for transferring the owner of our company. I work hard such as completing my tasks, supporting my teammate, receiving some new tasks ...I see two opinions appearing: "feeling happy to have more work" and another "feeling tired because of too much" in my company. A percentage of myself does not like to do too much But I understand it lasts a short period. Besides, I hope that I can have more work to do in the future. In my department, this time, there is a member who has to handle more work than us. We offer to help her but she refuses because it takes more time to guide us than do by herself She mentioned many times she was too busy because of too much work. I have a feeling I want to have more work to do this time to balance among our department . In the afternoon today, I have a small meeting with my manager. He guides me to do a sales report for the future and he also has a wish to promote me to Deputy Manager. He gives me pluses: "eager to learn, manage data, work hard, be careful" and minus "communication". He gives me some ways to improve that soft communication, Taking care of others,... I am good at an independent job but I am not sure what I can do for other members if I have a higher position. What can I do in this case? I would like to share a dream as below: An owner - a man allowed me to invest money a long time to his forest I saw some trees be cut down The cut spots were smeared with substance . I asked him about that. He said those trees cannot grow again. Thank you very much Duyen

file: A complex thought; last dream id: D0023; Date of dream: Friday, August 19, 2022 Angel: 2 Jeliel State of mind: Afraid Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana This week, I am working with Angel Jeliel and Angle Haziel. I have asked "Is my boyfriend a suitable husband for my program?". I received some dreams and I just remembered some images from them. I would like to share with you the following: - I forgot to wear a bra when I went somewhere. When I found that , I quickly tried to find something to cover. - I am standing on a small object floating on a large water Last week, my boyfriend and I went to a wedding of my best friends. Two of my best girl friends asked my boyfriend about the time we will marry. I heard from them one of the reason is that my boyfriend is following many goals in his life but I never heard from him or asked him about it. Is there a point I need to improve? Out of the confirmation from the Universe, what do I need to do for my couple, for my boyfriend and for myself? I don't understand him enough. I am not sure I take care of him enough. I also have a thought many times to reject our relationship. Sometimes, I want to be married, sometimes I don't want it. Why do I need to be married? Sister Vandana, what is the right thing? What should I do? Nearly a long vacation, I do not want to come home or my boyfriend's home, because I will hear the question: "When do we have a wedding? Why do we not make the final decision?" Additionally, I would like to share another story with you. I will leave the present company at the end of this month. My previous manager offered me a job related to accounting and sales admin in a building for lease. I have not had experience in accounting but I accept to be trained. My boss is good and the environment is good. My experience does not relate to it but I would like to do it. I will have a chance to organize, arrange documents, service customers ... Besides, I have studied sql to explore data analytics. It is the beginning of a journey. I see it is not easy at this age. But I still want to enjoy it. I feel happy when I solve a problem. I do not know how far I can go but I still continue to discover it. My friend asked me where I want to gain in the long term but I do not have an answer. Is that right? Thank you very much, Duyen

file: Marriage; last dream id: D0025; Date of dream: Friday, August 26, 2022 Angel: 18 Caliel State of mind: Surprise, neutral Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana, I would like to share with you the next story related to my couple's relationship. My boyfriend had told me that he had made a decision for our relationship but he needed more time to inform me officially. Last weekend, I shared my feelings and thoughts with my boyfriend. I asked him his emotions and opinions realted to marriage. I talked a lot about my negative thoughts, bad feelings, pressures, some intentions in marriage and raising a child... He listened to my sharing. I reasked his opinion. He required me to ask him yes-no questions instead of what, how, why questions Then, I asked him if we were married? If we will get married in September as per Lunar calendar?. He said yes and he let me know that his house in his hometown is being fixed. His family will come to my home early. I am a little happy but a big worry because I have not received the answer from Up Above for our relationship. Observing myself and receiving some advice from a DSSI friend, I realized I gave myself many reasons to avoid marriage - My wrong intention is perfection so I do not accept mistakes, learn from them. The friend reminded me of my intention on a new journey. I do not follow to be a better person. I let the outside things, the memories, the future affect me a lot and I focus on the negative too much. Although, I discussed becoming a better person to my boyfriend in the past. Mantra is one of the ways to help me remember my final intention, rectify my memories and it is a process to be a better person. - I use the sentence: "My parents do not teach me about this topic" to avoid taking responsibility. I have a right to improve myself in it. - I need to communicate properly with my boyfriend. It is a lesson. I usually keep silent on the subjects related to marriage, babies, the things I love, the things I hate, money ... with him because I am not confident to show myself. - I did not improve myself to be a better person every day. I just asked the Up Above and hope they will give me the final answer. This situation helps me to face the truth, the problems I need to rectify instead of delay. Last night, I had two dreams like the one below: First dream: I dreamed of a case from the Harry Potter series. There was a man who tried to save a person but his younger sister died . Second dream: It happened in my home. There was an elderly man who could not talk . He chose a kind of medicine in a wardrobe . I took 3 perfect pills and 1 urgly pill . I asked him to take the urgly pill first to delete it. Thank you very much, Duyen

One night, after our date , when I crossed an old woman who was riding a bike at a turn , my motorbike fell because it hit a stone . I just injured my knee a little. I also received a dream as below: My friends and I had a party . After I got drunk , I had a short sleep I came back to the party and sat with my female friends in the middle of the table while the male friends sat at two sides of the table. My attitude was not friendly at that time I ate some dishes on the table. Then I saw myself at a large land. I went to a big road by bicycle and chose a direction. Firstly, I turned right on my intuition. There was something incorrect I checked the google map and discovered I should turn left . So I turned left and I saw a woman with two barriers and two spaces between them. She would like to collect a fee But I ignored her and continued my direction . I passed by a pagoda where it had a billboard selling a thing in porcelain. I guessed it should be broken to define a real porcelain thing. I have had a 4-day holiday at my boyfriend's hometown. My boyfriend spent his time at some parties with his friends. He got drunk. After a party, he came home and found me. I saw my attitude was the same as my mother's when my father came home after a party. The attitude is an uncomfortable feeling and a little angry. I used to hate this attitude from my mother and also wished I would not repeat it. Thank you very much Duyen

Anthony and Vandana, The first DJ is a reminder for me on this spiritual way. Thank you for your guiding and sharing . I would like to share my dream interpretation this week. My mother and I came to check-in at a luxury beautiful hotel . Firstly, we were in line with a crowd attending an event of Pros. Kaya and Pros. Christian to take hotel slippers Everyone I met were easily angry . I saw two pairs of pink slippers in the basket; I took one slipper and another from a person. I suddenly recognized and apologized him but he was so angry to accept . He took a slipper without retaking. Some girls were noisy so I lost my attention. I needed to take a paper for check-in. My mother and I went along the corridor to our room, we could see all beds in all rooms there. Their walls were like a door to go through. A woman staff stood in the middle of the corridor to test and she asked me. I answered rightly so she let my mother and I go through. Two old friends helped us bring our luggage to our room I said something made my mother angry. She moved to the hotel lobby. The friends and I asked the reason but she kept silent and found something until my aunt appeared. She was angry and left. I am practicing to recognize myself three positive things and one improved thing every day. It is not easy for me. It also makes me less hard to others, now I still rarely appreciate or give compliment to other people who do the good things. It is a journey and I continue to do it. Wish you have a nice day!!!

I accepted that the story reflected my inner world which was unclear about my marriage so I met that case. I came back to work with the question - "Marrying my boyfriend is the right decision?". I received a dream as below: I would like to go to the toilet knew that I could find that in my grandmother's room . I went to that room . I saw the first grandmother who was eating at a table near the door. And the second grandmother was taking the toilet beside the room . I waited for the second grandmother. After going to the toilet, the second grandmother came to the room and asked the first grandmother to clean her . The first grandmother was trying to complete her meal to do it. I went to the toilet and it has not flushed . I pushed the button two or three times continuously. Suddenly my younger brother and an animal sat on it. They made the toilet clogged then the whirlpool was very strong then splashed out. When I ran out , I remembered there was something near it. In another day, I had a dream as below: I saw my male colleague He talked to me to focus the coffee project by whispering . After that, I woke up at night. Thank you Duyen

file: Sea; last dream id: D0032; Date of dream: Thursday, September 22, 2022 Angel: 2 Jeliel State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana, After the seminar of Angel Jeliel, I came back to within more . I am so glad when I can remember the below dream a lot. I also discovered some memories causing me trouble in my relationship. Firstly, I would like to share my dream as below: I drove a motorbike with my female younger cousin to visit a beach in my hometown . I couldn't see clearly but I still tried to move. My cousin and I talked a lot about her trip with her parents before they came to my home. Then, we met two of my male friends - Ngoc and Hoang They also drove a motorbike. We greeted each other and talked, then we continued our way. I thought too much, my sharing and my action is not enough so there is a discrepancy My cousin and I came to a place where her sister slept in an object on the beach. We woke her up. These days, I continue working with the angle on the intention of my boyfriend. We must be fit at 4 levels - spiritual, lectual, emotions and physical. For me, they are still general. Could you explain to me in detail? I also shared developing qualities, my learning DSSI, some things I learned from DSSI with my boyfriend. I asked him his opinion, he still wants to marry me. I saw I didn't pay enough attention to him. He has good actions but I do not say anything, do not encourage, do not record. I focus more on his wrong actions. I let my negative memories affect me a lot. I used to let my thoughts take control and this time, I am studying and doing a way to let them go, to give myself and my boyfriend better taking care. . My boyfriend and I make love. My thought is always that he just wants my body when he does not take care of me enough I am scared to face it if it becomes true. The thought came to nature and last night, when it came, I observed it and understood it is one of the reasons why I do not believe him fully, I did not record his other good actions, his personality. I just thought about my insecurity. Thank you Duyen

file: Advance by a stick; last dream id: D0033; Date of dream: Friday, September 30, 2022 Angel: 2 Jeliel State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana I would like to share my dream. I am asking the Up Above "is my boyfriend the right person for me in this life?". Is it right to ask too much one question? I use a masculine wooden ruler fly with my female friend . It was like a broomstick We went through a forest to somewhere. THEN I lost her so I came back to find my friend. The dream shows me the uncomfortable part I am trying to avoid doing that. It causes myself the inside too much thought, too much emotion. As I shared I thought negatively too much, I used to force myself to do something instead of analyzing the meaning of my thoughts. It was a wrong way because it is still there without fixing. In meditation, I can focus on one thought and find the memories causing that to fix. I have not met my friend in a long time. She used to be one of my best friends. We spent our time in our childhood. Once, she and another friend misunderstood each other. I knew the reason so I explained the story to the friend to help them fix their relationship. My friend knew that so she thought I was a talkative, unreliable friend and she did not want to meet me anymore. Although I apologized to her, she did not accept. We didn't meet anymore from that. My parents have just called me and asked me an option for my relationship. My family want us to organize a pre-wedding party at my home on the day a feng shui master told for our couple. I have not received the answer from the Up Above so I do not follow that fully. I just let my boyfriend know that. I do not dare to share I am waiting for the answer from the Up Above. I only delay and delay. I saw myself putting my attention to my boyfriend too much. I always put all of my priorities for him. I schedule my time following his schedule. It is not right. I like to stand by him. What should I do to fix it? Because it is unbalanced. Thank you Duyen

Is everything okay? I have not contacted you since our scheduled meeting at 5:30 p.m. 12.10.2022. This week the Up Above gives me an opportunity to work with the Angel Chavakiah. I see the synchronization from the Up Above in this week. My brother is getting married in 2019. He keeps a relationship with a woman in chat, not his wife from a long time. His wife knew that and she felt unacceptable. She heard the story from the sister of the woman. And she also saw some messages from my brother's phone. She felt terrible and angry, so she shared it with me. Until now, my brother and she have not solved it clearly. Besides, my sister-in-law is pregnant. My family wants my brother to take a trip to HCM city to check his health. But my sister-in-law did not want that, she said my family made the decision without discussing it with her. She thought he just found a reason to gather with his friends. She was so angry. Then my brother must delay his trip. I also received a dream as below: I shared with my mother many kinds of sweet soups . Besides, last night, I also caught the card of Angel Chavakhiah and it reminded me to continue working with it. I look forward to hearing from you soon, Thank you Duyen

I set a new schedule at 5:00 p.m. 25/10 for our meeting. I hope you can fix that. I would like to share my story this week. At the end of last week, after setting up basically the coffee store all day, I felt tired, exhausted and terrible. I would like to stop working. When I shared my feelings and my work with my mother, she told me this was a job I chose and I was silly choosing that. The job does not belong to my major. Besides, some old colleagues also told me the job is more simple than my ability. I also felt alone when I could not share with anyone. I reminded myself the purpose of working is developing quality. My feelings at that time were so strong. I cried a lot. I shared them with my boyfriend and he encouraged me to continue because the job will let me study how to manage a store, staffs. I hugged myself softly. The next day I continued working in my tired body. My mind still had a thought about quitting the job. It lasted two days then I became more comfortable. I have not found the memories causing that. Last night, I got a dream as below I was on the way to my grandfather's house . Then I drove around an area two times . I put a male stranger But I avoided him. I moved to my female friend's house . Thank you Duyen

file: My grandfather; last dream id: D0036; Date of dream: Friday, November 11, 2022 Angel: 69 Rochel State of mind: alone, sad Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana I have just left a party in the middle when most of the members drank beers and I chose to drink pure water. I am happy because no one pushes me to drink beer. I didn't belong to that. I did not know which subject I could share with them. I kept silent and smiled. This week, I had a date with two girlfriends. We had a dinner meal in a vegetarian restaurant. One of them talked a lot about what another friend and I should do and live in this life esp marriage. I did not feel comfortable because the conversation was more negative. She tried to push us to take action. But another friend and I needed to have more time to make decisions under our natural speed. I observed it, I felt uncomfortable but I knew if I tried to talk at this time, my tone was not good. I would protect myself. I chose to listen and understand I used to put my opinions on others. My energy went down after the date. I should be careful in a conversation. Sometimes I can take energy from others. She had a difficult period when she must show her ability to prove herself in her work. She is a part of myself which is trying to put other parts following. I am too hard on myself. I continue to work with myself, to give more love to myself and respect others' opinions. , she is on her Besides journey so I should respect it. I would like to share my dream of this week as below: I and my relatives sat and had a party at my grandfather's house together . I sat next to my grandfather. One relative constantly speaks provokingly to me . I felt angry. I throw a bowl four times to remind him. At the end of the party my grandfather told me a story from yesterday . My relatives asked a feng shui master about their good day but no one asked for me . He asked for me . My good day is December 14th according to the Lunar Calendar . Then he left. I stayed to clean. I did while I cried. I felt sad because no one took care of me. My cousin asked for help from me. But I rejected him. I cried in reality after this dream. I was reminded Evil is education. The negative dream shows the thing I should work. Thank you Duyen

I came back to change from my dress to my pants for the trip. was dirt road houses after the stones . We stopped at a house having vines the way. I fell unconscious and woke up tomorrow morning but my cousin left me at that house and come back. The owner took me to the beginning point by horse The next case, I hold my baby in line to meet a man doctor . In the line, I saw my boyfriend , some women and some children. My boyfriend was like a stranger. I loved my fragile child. My mother and my cousin appeared. There was an accident, a man wearing a white shirt without pants somersaulted. He wasn't hurt but his face was a little silly. Many people moved to watch but I came back to take care of my child. The doctor reminded me to apply for my medical record I gave my child to my mother before he took my blood from my hand. My cousin waited too long so she gave a reason for changing oil for our motorbike to let us come home but the doctor didn't and he gave her some money for changing oil near the place. Many memories I accumulated effect to my definition. I have a trouble to define it is plus or minus because I am scared to be criticized of course I criticize others too much Thank you. Duyen

I came to a relative's house (I just felt that) . The house had a bathroom for a woman in another house A man and I were in front of our house. He confessed his love to me. I was happy and confused because I also had feelings for him and I was in a relationship with my present boyfriend. I didn't say anything to him. I came into the house. I met 3 female friends going to play badminton . Then the man and his male friend came into the house to take a shower . He tries to show his erect penis to me before going into the bathroom. At that moment, my brother was also there. I went out of the house to move to the bathroom for women. I didn't remember exactly where the bathroom was. I went into the wrong house where I saw a female was sleeping with a very cold atmosphere from the referee She woke up and saw me. I apologized to her . She presented the cute things which she was selling I promised to buy them later. Then I went down her staircase. I realized I was lost, I forgot the relative's house. Thank you for your guide. I feel more touched when I have learned more about the dream. The message from Up Above is so profound, the root cause of my matter. Duyen

file: Try to do the best; last dream id: D0040; Date of dream: Friday, December 2, 2022 Angel: 35 Chavakhiah State of mind: Scared Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana The dream was interpreted by you so profoundly. I am not sure about my feelings for my boyfriend. I am not sure I want him to become my husband or a father of my children. Sometimes I want, sometimes, I don't want. I usually arrange my schedule to spend my time with him rather than with my friend or myself. He schedules and spends his time playing football, having parties with his colleagues, his friends. I asked myself what kind of our relationship is, what our common things are. Sometimes, we walk in a park, visit his relatives but our topic is so limited. Besides, he has never discussed our future plans. Sometimes I asked him about our marriage. He told me he needed more time. I do not know whether I should talk about this topic because I have not received the guide from Up Above so I avoided mentioning it. This week, Prof Kaya will decode dreams via zoom. I had an opportunity to join with 2 friends. But I have not shown my invitation to my boyfriend. I hope that we can share the same topic related to symbolic language with the life purpose of developing qualities. Going to within, I am scared to be alone. It is one of the reasons why I do not want to lose him. This week, my work is not easy. My staff for the coffee store are sick and I spend most of my time working in the coffee store. I found more staff to expand the business but I have not found out. I should develop the business but it is not easy. I want to give up. I give myself the reason related to spiritual way. Then I remind myself the life purpose. This situation helps me not to be too airy, more realistic. I would like to share my dream this week: My boyfriend and I were in my room in my house . He did not wear clothes . We went out of the room to go somewhere. My grandfather and my father saw us. He came back to my room. I talked with them about my boyfriend. They advised me not to do that. Thank you a lot to be by my side, ... Duyen

These days, I have not slept well. I am easy to wake up at midnight. I felt uncomfortable, and tired in the morning. It likes I have a sleep from midnight and I have not slept enough. There are something raising from my unconsciousness and I should accept it and meditate with the Mantra to understand it . This week, I asked the Up Above whether it is the right time to change my job. I want to share my dream I received this week: I went to my relative's house on my boyfriend motorbike . I drove while my friends rode a bicycle. The road was terrible. I have not come to a specific point. I'm coming back. On my way, there was a point - a low wall . My motorbike could not cross and I should find another road. Two old women wanted me to put my motorbike next to the wall to let them climb over it, but I rejected it. They could climb on its ledges. I continue my way. Suddenly I found that the license plate was lost. I must go on the previous track. Then I saw the place I crossed but now it was closed to motorbikes. I stopped it. One of the two women kicked the ball to my face . She didn't say sorry. I was angry and shouted at her. Thank you Duyen

file: A falling; last dream id: D0042; Date of dream: Thursday, February 23, 2023 Angel: 36 Menadel State of mind: Surprise, Angry, Afraid Dream and analysis: Dear Prof. Anthony and Dr. Mayur I lost my sleep tonight. A lot of thoughts come to me. I felt tired and wanted to sleep back. I do not feel at ease at this time. I saw many problems in me. I want to become better in every aspect of my life. I separate my life into some fields like my work (What I can do, What should I move in the next step), my physical body (my skin sick and nose sick), my couple relationship (my marriage), my friend relationship (some friends have trouble and they are learning spiritual)... I stick to them. I am trying to fix all of them as quickly as possible. I ask for help from everyone except myself to find an easy way to all of my problems. I am escaping my life. All my problems are not from the outside. They come from my heart. I just remember that they are one from a teacher. They are different experiences to help me evolve qualities and purify my distortions. I should come back. I want to share my dream this week: I, my boyfriend , her younger sister , his cousin-sister , and his cousin-sister's daughter were in a strange place. . The sister, the cousin, the daughter, and I went along a lake . I made the daughter fall into the lake. The baby did not know how to swim. We didn't know how to swim. So we went near the lake and blared to find help. No one appeared. The daughter was taken near the bank. The cousin took her up. The sister said it was my fault. My boyfriend came to the daughter. He didn't notice me. I felt guilty and angry when I left. I am also thinking whether the right time to leave my present job. I shared my thoughts with my manager. He gave me one week to think about it carefully. Because this time is not good to change. My director wants to help me when she heard that I have a question from my colleague. I said it was another time. I notice a point. I am not ready to exchange my opinion with my director. There is a space and I asked myself the reason why I felt that. She is an excellent person in business. She runs her previous factory very well under government laws. She taught my manager very well. She is finding some new projects to expand her business after leaving the factory. I rarely talk with her. Everyone has a life program. I am not right when I looked at her results at the physical level. I should respect her rightly and recognize her qualities and distortions. , I am just besides trying to escape my work more than developing my quality. Thank you Duyen

He gave me some primary information about my personality, strengths, and weaknesses depending on my birthday. He applied not only the East's but also the West's knowledge. The most important thing I should do first is to find my core values. He guided me on some ways to find that like reading I Ching or Buddhist books. And I thought that it is developing qualities from UCM last year. These qualities are my core values and they help me make decisions. Do I understand rightly? I would like to share the dream I received before my above meeting as below: I met the person at a place. When he shared a part of myself, he called my female friend - my high schoolmate to join our meeting. From that point, he taught her his job and ignored me. There was a friend which went around the place. Then he went out. We moved to another room. He came back with low energy so he could not share anything with me. Thank you Duyen

The school was too strict Firstly, Some friends and I investigated the death of a beautiful girl our school. I was chased when I tried to solve it. Secondly, my class had almost started but I had not brushed my teeth . I moved out of the classroom to go to the toilet. I moved the movable barrier to get out. But the time was over, so I returned to the class without brushing my teeth. I received a message to move to another better class I have not solved my problem, I have a superior thought, so I moved to another matter . My female teacher checked the message before letting me out. I went to the new class. In the front of the class, I saw some students who were punished. The male teacher did not want to receive me because the class was full. But I was still there. , I had another dream Besides that I was being chased by something.

We lived in an old boarding house. The first scene, my boyfriend and I brought the bicycle to the house. There was a helpful woman who kept it for us. But I was worried it might be lost and I would like to go somewhere by it so I came back to take it. She said it was locked in a room. A female cleaner brought the key. A couple in my boyfriend's team invited me to go out. I got a stomachache, so I went back to a toilet. His female colleagues lived full a room so I should move to another room. When I had just sat on the toilet, my boyfriend opened the small glass door and talked to me. I felt shy so I requested him close it. Then other people came to my room. I was so shy and I wanted them to leave. But one man said his bathroom was damaged . Thank you Duyen

Vandana, Your revising my dreams is so great . I am encouraged to face difficult memories by compassion, love, wisdom ... Thank you very much. Last night, I spent my time watching two series of Korea with two multiples at speed. The contents were not good, the characters fell in love and had sexuality too fast or they had sexuality without love. I slept around 11:45 p.m. and woke up around 3 am. I was affected by two films. I did not make a good choice for my soul. I would like to share a dream for this week. This dream appeared when I watched the Good Doctors on Netflix After school, I went to the library where Dr. Glassman is a bookkeeper. I was looking for my name in a newspaper . I also felt that I almost found that. But I have not seen it. Some friends had the same purpose as me. Then a person, Hoang , found the newspaper having his name. We finding continued over lunch. Dr. Glassman went to take the lunch and reminded us of having lunch. I still paid attention to finding it in anger because I nearly had it. I would do it quickly to come home and my mother would not be angry with me. After looking for a long time, I felt hungry so I stopped to eat. I came out and met Dr. Glassman came back, I also saw our school was preparing for the final meeting. I saw many teachers were walking. One of them was Nhan , a homeroom teacher. He was coming back to the room for homeroom teachers. I remembered I have not completed the exercises from Dr. Glassman. He gave them to me at the end of this morning. I continued looking for the newspaper. I brought high newspapers on a window to check but nothing. I realized the exercises are more important than looking. Thank you for being here Duyen

We were taken care of by our fat older sister She and her husband had a conflict. She . Fortunately she was rescued in time. She was taken to our home by boat. Her underwear floated and came to us first. We were scared to see that . Then the boat brought her back. She was naked We were so happy. Each of us hugged her. One of us was shy. The next scene: There was a beautiful house surrounded by a garden . I was looking after Ken, my young nephew . I had a stomachache . I came in and called his mother who was on a call to replace me. But when I saw her, she was sleeping so I woke her up. I went to the toilet in the back of the garden. I saw wild boars was about to butt each other. I just remembered there was a toilet in the house, I ran in. I closed the door in time. I suddenly remembered my nephew was in the front of the garden so I had an intention to rescue him. . On Wednesday, I had a date with my friends. One of my friends has been in a bad mood for a period. She was on the negative side when she felt lost in her marriage. All of the things she shared that day were the faults of her husband and his family. She loses most of her energy when she tries to get attention and compliments from outside. When we talked to her, it should be changed. She said she knew that but her thoughts were too strong so she was finding a teacher to solve the problems. I saw her rejection of our ideas. Her masculine energy is too strong now. I hope she can recover soon. Thank you Duyen

file: A Scare; last dream id: D0050; Date of dream: Sunday, April 9, 2023 Angel: 4 Elemiah State of mind: Afraid Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Dr. Mayur I would like to share the story of my couple. I asked my boyfriend if he was ready for our wedding. He said yes and he will propose to me. I waited. He didn't do or say anything. I asked him when he did it. He said it would be soon. Last week, I thought we can prepare some things for our wedding constantly. When I asked him if he was ready for our wedding. He said ready does not exist in this matter. But he did not answer directly so I reasked him the next day. He talked he was not ready at this time. I felt a little bit disappointed and did not understand what was wrong. I came back home and asked the Up Above if he was the right person. I doubted. I used to ask about him and I received a dream he proposed to me with the UCM Vietnam team at the beginning of this year. That night, I had a dream: I was alone in the big field at night . I felt scared. I didn't know where I should go. I suddenly woke up after this dream. I fell into a scared state. I felt lost, insecure, and alone. I tried to be calm by invoking Angel 24 but I cannot remember the name of Angel 24th although I worked with the angel many times and it was also my angel of this year. Every time, I closed my eyes, I was in a large black area. My scare appeared. I opened my eyes. It lasted about 30 minutes. I can sleep again and I received another dream named Preparing a Wedding. My relatives came to my house to congratulate my marriage . My house was beside the sea . . My parents and she came to the place to take wedding photos first. I saw the guests off before leaving there. We had thought about how many clothes we should bring. I thought it should be four . I also wanted to bring a dress but I could not because . I brought jeans and shirts. When I took clothes to the place, I should go to a canal. The place to take photos was far. I could not walk so I rented a bicycle for 5 hours. Then I came to the place.

My father became a tiger trying to chase my mother and me. My mother hid in a small house near our house. I was afraid so I ran back and forth along the corridor to see where my father was. Then my father discovered me, so I ran to my mother to ask her to let me hide. My mother and I hid in that tiny house. We were scared. The door was closed and bolted inside. The door had a large gap at the bottom. My father started to scratch continuously at the gap but we could avoid it. He lifted the roof , took the whole bucket of water next to the house, and poured it on us. The thoughts and feelings appear to try to solve. This dream shows me, my model, when I feel insecure. I have a tendency to seem okay but my inner world is terrible. This dream lets me review my childhood. When I was a child, I stole my parents' money to give to my brother. He used it to play games on the Internet and bought something for me. My parents discovered that and it is the first time my father beat me (my mother used to beat me for my faults). They said I was the one who ruined my brother's future when I gave him money to play games. He was addicted to that and he did not want to study more. I felt guilty for a long time. The second time, my father beat me when I lied to my parents I said I would go to study but I joined an event at my school. My father felt angry. I am not ready to show my opinion to my family. I become too sensitive every time like that. I hide my personality, my decisions, and my opinions. Thank you Duyên

file: A sick; last dream id: D0053; Date of dream: Friday, May 12, 2023 Angel: 13 Iezalel 18 Caliel State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Dr. Mayur Thank you for your profound sharing. After receiving your last message on my DJ, I am a little bit shocked because I am known I am not open enough with my boyfriend. I was so certain about what I should do for our relationship as I shared. I realize that he was so difficult to share every time I asked him about his thoughts and feelings. I asked myself what I should do to let him open with me. Last night, I had a date with him after a silent period. I reminded myself to open with him in my mind. I thought I need to ask and listen to him fully. I learn to be patient, not compare, and let him feel free to share his opinion, right? I asked him how he felt at this period of time. He took a lot of time to say what he thought. He said his mind has been confused about our relationship from the time when his family visited my family in 2021 and we have been in a couple since 2018. This meeting happened from his parents' plan, not from him and at that time he did not have enough courage to exchange his opinion with his family. From that time, every time, he puts me, he has pressure, and over time, his feeling decreases for me. Until now, he does not know what he should do with me, continue or not. I also do not know what I can do for myself and for him. Why do we fall into this situation? What should I do for myself and for him? The couple is not depending on feelings , it should include physical level, emotion level, thought level, and spiritual level. I used to think about how we can have the best emotions, and look forward to making them... It limits the way we experience when we just think and focus on the emotional level. It comes from the memories we recorded in our lives. I accept what he feels, what he thinks, and what he acted. It is his choice and he is learning like me. He is thinking is a plus. He wants to do the right thing for him and for me. What do I suggest to him to help him have the right choice? How about we review our past without living in the present? Is it right when he and I have discussions about our past experiences and what we learn from them? I do not want to put my opinions, emotions on him. They should be shared and understood by each other. I also have a thought, I observe his past actions, and I still see them as love gestures. It is not his complete responsibility to lie to me. Every thought and every feeling should be noticed and rectified when they are not right. I would like to analyze a dream I received from Up Above recently when I worked with the Angel 18 Caliel if I continue or not with him. My paternal family had a big party with many adults and children. Some of them were my uncles and aunts. I feel competitive so I took a beer for my younger sister after she borrowed a beer from someone. But she rejected me so I must drink and I was drunk. I walked around to find someone who helped me drink the balance of my beer. Everyone was drunk but the children. I met my boyfriend . He was also drunk too. He took me to find a place to sleep. We go up the stairs. He tripped. After that, he took his phone to talk with Bo, his cousin in Ha Noi about an upcoming football match. At this time, I got a cold. It is a sign for me not to transform quickly. It takes time. Thank you Duyen

file: Separating class; last dream id: D0055; Date of dream: Monday, May 22, 2023 Angel: 19 Leuviah State of mind: Embarrassed Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Dr Mayur, I am okay at this time. I learned a lot in this seminar. It is an opportunity to apply the Law of Resonance for my relationship. A part of myself prevented me from accepting this is my fault. I open another view. Sometimes I try to please someone to get love. To a point, I felt too lost, empty so I asked myself who I was. There was a discrepancy between my inner world and my outer world. I feel very touched after reading your revision this week. It encouraged me to continue working. I saw a part of my resistance. It does not want to change, to step. I asked myself what the thing I wanted to do. It is the way I must step but I am scared to step. I am not sure I can commit to do it or not. I am scared that one time I will run away, I will compromise. I thought I used to do it. I compromised many times and I got karmas so the light is clear and I need to step although my negative parts are there to keep me. These days, I got dreams every night, and I practiced mantras every time I have time. I saw an important thing it is the way I sing for myself. In the previous sometimes my way is not polite, not sacred. I change the way I sing, I would like to give the best voice with the softness for my soul. It is so blessed, so beautiful. The mantra helps me calm through the feelings alone, emotional dependencies, and emotional difficulties when my negative thoughts appear. Firstly, when I put a tax officer. I was scared because it is related to justice, sometimes I felt difficult every time it was related to government. This time, I just felt a little bit scared and everything is okay, he guided me clearly on what I should do. It can be easy to ask about my concerns. Secondly, today I just realize the love I received. As I shared, sometimes I felt disconnected. I can't feel the love for me. This morning, my boyfriend's sister contacted me to give me a present from my boyfriend's mother. I was confused if it is right to receive it at this time. I feel it is okay, it is a gift and I receive it with my appreciation. I called to my mother and talked about my niece and some normal stories. Sometimes I felt a little bit uncomfortable when my mom talked something. Then I spent one hour to talk with my boyfriend's mother about her gift, her life, ... naturally. After these two conversations, I felt a stranger feeling. I remembered the questions my mom asked me about the food, my difficulty, ... I feel so appreciated. I feel the love from my mother when I am far from my family. I feel the love from my boyfriend's mother. She told me the stories, and answered my questions. She also shared her health, her work naturally. Calling is one of the ways to show our love, our care. One more time, it helps me realize she represents my boyfriend's inner world, it always has pluses and minuses. My relationship is an experiment for us to learn and to do the right things. Sometimes, I felt difficult to deal with my negative thought. But I remember a guide from Prof Kaya in this seminar. Life is always a challenge. I am studying the way to give unconditional love with wisdom. I would like to analyze this dream as below: Separating class , Y and I studied with another female teacher about civic education. In the beginning, the teacher sat between I and Y at the round table. We joined the test. Y sat at the table beside the door, the teacher and I sat at the table opposite that table, between two tables was a wall. The test was the list of dishes. I arranged the order suitably. The principal appears with a friend. They sat on my right side. The principal asked me and watched me the way I cooked. When I looked at my notebook, I discovered my notebook was cluttered with paper shortages and I noted other subjects on that. I feel embarrassed for the principal. I remembered the third dish I chose was a kind of soup. My teacher must give me the material because it was very special. This week, I analyzed my dream almost finished but it happens a mistake when I try to save it. It is a reminder for me to be planned for the next time better. This dream is related to the right authority. When I let the positions and the ages affect me the way I communicate and act with others. I should respect everyone in terms of soul. Thank you Duyen

file: My anger; last dream id: D0056; Date of dream: Friday, June 2, 2023 Angel: 37 Aniel State of mind: Sad Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Dr Mayur, This week my feelings are not good. I work concentrated but when I returned home, I felt tired and let myself watch short videos related to anime and cartoons. My feeling changes sometimes up sometimes down. My boyfriend still keeps silent after my message to exchange. I call him but he is busy with a party so I will call back later. This week, my mother asked me about my couple's status. I said it broke. She gently encouraged me to live freely. Another point I discovered was my anger. When I worked with Angel Aniel related to breaking the old pattern. I repeat a pattern . When someone did not agree with my work, I quickly became angry to show up my abilities and my other's wrong points. I have a tendency to find weak proof from others to force them to follow my point without listening fully although maybe their opinion is not suitable at this time but their intention is good. In the first story, I spent a lot of time making a file shortly, precisely but another colleague does not believe my data, so he tries to reject it. My manager also talked to me that if I am more receptive, he will let me support the customers more. Sometimes, the customer will not be satisfied and has some bad words but I should learn to deal with it politely. In the second story, my older brother called me about checking out a famous hospital for my father. It is the first time my father accepts going to check his health condition at a hospital in HCM city (now they are in my hometown far from HCM city around 600km). My father does not want to check because It will let him know his health status. My brother wants to choose the best hospital and do all the tests including gastroscopy although my father does not have pain in the stomach. I use our financial condition and the hurt in gastroscopy to reject his idea. My brother shouted at me. He said I only ignore his ideas for many reasons. I felt angry too and I do not want to continue our call. I observe my intensity. I keep silent for a minute, I see my resistance then I note his opinion. I told him I would do the things and replied to him later. We talked like that many times in a long time. Every time, he puts his opinion on others, he becomes too sensitive, he did not want to listen to others and he thought he understood this matter more clearly. I also have this like him. Esp when he is my brother. I do not like that, I used to become gentle with him in that case but it was a facade. Inside me, I still think I was right and he was wrong. I repressed my feelings and my thoughts until I didn't keep them inside anymore. When it was a facade it did not solve the matter. My brother triggered me many negative thoughts every time I met him. I see myself I have a tendency to avoid him . This lesson is very important and I should do it soon. In the third story, my roommate kept the gate key for almost a month since our owner gave her . When I asked her to give it to me because I need to go out in the early morning. She gave me two keys and said she could not remember what is the right key. I asked her to check and give me the right key. But she rejected it. I felt angry without understanding her case. And she ignored me and didn't say anything. These cases make me feel tired, hard and do not want to do anymore. I realized the Up Above brings them to teach me, to stop me nourishing my anger. It took a lot of energy and the aura was terrible. I practice a lesson. I imagined each above story and I changed the way of talking from my brother, my roommate, and mine around these matters to gentle and right before sleeping. I understand they are parts of me, and I am improving my communication. Do I understand right? These days, my stomach does not feel good. I felt a little bit uncomfortable. The stomach is related to my feeling centers, I have difficulty digesting and nourishing my feelings . I would like to analyze this dream: My boyfriend , my mother and I were on the way. I saw Hoang . So I called him, my mother became angry but I argued with her. Thank you Duyen

file: A movement; last dream id: D0057; Date of dream: Wednesday, June 7, 2023 Angel: 61 Umabel State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Dr. Mayur This week, I observed one of my points of view in my life. Life is so short and I must save my time. Sometimes I make the decision in a hurry. If I didn't do it, I would regret it in the future. It is not right when we are a soul. We must follow the natural movement under developing the qualities. It is also an aspect of patience. I would like to share with you some good news. I met my boyfriend and we had a beautiful meeting. I almost felt soft and comfortable. I shared my feelings, and my intentions for my couple: developing qualities with 3 options (continue with the right intentions, pause in one month and stop our relationship). He had difficulty making decisions. I was patient to let him think, give him the plus and the minus of each option, and share what I have learned from UCM in the three years since I knew UCM and the way of making decisions under developing qualities. He did it. He chooses option 3, stopping our relationship. I respected his choice. I felt sad but the process of sharing gives me the courage to continue to advance. The pain is still there. I discovered some new parts of myself: some patterns in love, and some wrong intentions in owning a person, ...When I observed my miss of my boyfriend, I thought a part of it came from my possession , my instinctual needs. I love the knowledge from UCM but I see my resistance. How could I work it rightly? This week I would like to analyze this dream as below: I joined a party with my aunt 's friends and some of my uncles at a beautiful house , which was made from bamboo and raised on stilts over the surface of the soil. The party was done in the middle of the house. The front of the house is a beautiful lobby. People sit in a long line, female, male, and then female. I sat at the end of the line. Sitting a little bit, I went to the front to take photos of my aunt and nephew. But I couldn't take a beautiful photo. I took a rest. It rained. The ceiling was not sealed. Some friends started leaving. My aunt, uncle, and some nephews sat in a great place to take photos. Those friends needed to take shoes at the place I took photos so I was reminded to go out. But the photos were not beautiful so we stopped. One of those friends lost the vehicle card. Thanh Linh gave his card to the friend. My boyfriend was also at the party but in the beginning, he was so strange to me. Until now he reminded me Thanh Linh used to help me like this. Although at that time, his help was not successful, I did not remind. Then I leave but I still want him to keep me back but he was still strange to me. I heard from 2 men why the owner did not let the bank rent this place because the owner must rent the guard but letting the bank rent will get more money. Thank you Duyen

file: Visiting a cinema; last dream id: D0058; Date of dream: Monday, March 28, 2022 Angel: 38 Haamiah State of mind: Afraid Dream and analysis: Dear Prof. Anthony and Sis. Vandana, I hope you have a nice day! I would like to share a dream which I asked the Universe if the job was fit for my evolution. The dream is as below: My father and I went to a cinema by motorbike. We stopped at the parking lot which was opposite the cinema and at the foot-slope. There were two female street vendors offering us food and drink too much. Then we agreed to buy and we ate there. My father suddenly wanted to gamble with the lotteries of the vendor. He lost. When everything becomes difficult, I will just do a new thing with a hope of luck and lack of going deeply to clean the negative memories. After eating, my father and I left the waste for the vendor We also received a reminder of cleaning from a female guard standing far from us but we still continued. The vendor did not clean and left. My mother and I went to a cinema by motorbike. Inside of me, I continue comparing myself with others. An old girlfriend appeared and went with us. My ex-boyfriend wanted to meet me but I rejected and he followed us . My mother and I left our motorbike at a parking lot and walked to the cinema. The cinema was crowded. There were many people walking too. The old girlfriend told me a story about my ex-boyfriend. When I was taken to a country, he betrayed this country to take me back . My mother and I saw a crowd. I saw my boyfriend fixing his motorbike with my brother. The motorbike has a chain trouble. He tried to watch the movie with us. Two girl strangers told me his other problem - crossing the red light and getting punished. I was angry because he didn't tell me. Before bringing his motorbike to be fixed, he and I came to the cinema to buy a ticket for him. I did not want him to watch because I did not want him to see my ex-boyfriend. At the main door, there was a stranger who gave us a ticket - 30 thousand VND. I realized my ex-boyfriend was behind the scene. I rejected buying My boyfriend and I came to the ticket office. There were 2 women who sold the tickets for a couple Thank you very much, Duyen

file: A break; last dream id: D0059; Date of dream: Thursday, June 15, 2023 Angel: 16 Hekamiah State of mind: uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Dr. Mayur This week I received some signs related to angle Achaiah, I woke up at 2:2 then I watched the online course from An Nguyen about skin, I read a message from my mother to inform my father was hurt in an accident. He got some damage but they are not significant. But his left shoulder was not good, his hand could not lift up. He took an X-ray scan but his bones are okay, Now he should follow it in a period of time. I watched the course "The Birth of a Dream" by Prof Kasara. It is so touching, profound, and inspiring. It is very very beautiful. Prof Anthony and Prof Kasara are joining the project in equilibrium. I asked myself why I miss my relationship and still hope when we are not balancing and mixing many things. I continue to work on my memories to be myself within and outside. My family has a problem related to my brother's couple. He does not share or give money to his wife esp when they have just had a baby. It is an accumulated matter for a long time since they married. Their marriage and their having a child are a push from family so it is not right in their attitude. His wife does not respect him. It is a lesson to let them learn. I also need to cleanse my memories related to that. Next, my brother found compensation from outside by talking to a woman. It is not the right way to solve a problem. How do I use money rightly at my personal, couple, and family level? When we move to a higher level, we must manage money in the right way. Maybe two members should give 50/50 or 40/60... to a common account and arrange it clearly. One day, I asked myself what next after our relationship's status. I felt scared to face the truth. When my friend asks me about our relationship, I am not ready to share it. I saw myself keeping hope to come back. That night, I received two dreams as below: 1. Quang returned home from the Philippines . He invited my friends, me and my ex-boyfriend) to meet for a drink . I sat at a table near their table. I needed to complete a task before meeting them. I missed my task a little bit. When I lack concentration, my task could take more time to complete and I just want to complete it quickly. My intention and the process are very important. When I completed my task, they were ready to leave the party after sitting overnight. I saw Oanh 's face was very wet. A difficulty to transform emotions in the right way when I have a facade and expectations. I stood at the parking at a distance from them. I only met Quang. I explained the reason why I could not join and my relationship's status because my ex-boyfriend was also in the party. He sympathized with my story. 2. The second dream I received after noting the first dream, most of the characters are strange. Some friends and I were in a rented house . That night, two girls were very noisy for a matter. One of the two girls must pick up her mother and boss at the airport. My ex-boyfriend, the other girl, and I sat next to the window for talking. Then a couple came. I thought it was a coincidence but the girl had an appointment with them. They left. I asked my ex-boyfriend how to use a notebook . I kissed his cheek before I left him to take my notebook while he arranged his notebook. I reminded myself it was not right in my mind. He did not react. When I come back, he guided me on how to use a notebook. Thank you for your support on this journey. Duyen

file: Clemency; last dream id: D0061; Date of dream: Thursday, August 31, 2023 Angel: 32 Vasariah 69 Rochel State of mind: uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Angelic hello, dear Prof Anthony and Dr Mayur, I am glad to hear that you are better. During the retreat, I found the family's love again after the Yana session with a hammock. The broken story became light and it did not affect my feelings, or my thoughts anymore. I felt okay, more receptivity, more softness after the Retreat. On the first day at my work after the retreat, my little finger on my left hand was hit by a can while I tried to take an object. My finger has bent with hurt until now. After that, I put some colleagues at the restroom, at the time I came back to my work, I hit the door on my left ankle and my left head. I am so touched with the UCM knowledge and I would like to integrate it deeply. Last night, I had a call with my ex-boyfriend's mother. We listen and share our stories with each other. . Her knee joints are dry. She also shared that my ex-boyfriend had tonsillitis in the hospital. She felt sad when he didn't connect to her. Her story lets me think about the family relationship. I used to feel okay when I didn't build my relationship with my parents. They lived far from me. We do not keep the connection correctly. Now, I am rebuilding it, reconnecting the origin of the feminine and masculine polarities. I retouched the love from my family. In the retreat, Prof Haritha told me that someone would die if they felt no one needed them and sometimes, a person took his parents for granted that they were always there. I studied to balance my relationships. I have two dreams - two images as below: 1st image: I opened my fridge and the fridge was working normally in the cool area. I was so surprised because the cool-area fridge in reality did not work in a long time. 2nd image: I received a large carpet from a person. I discovered some positions having ants going out. I reminded my friend to be careful. (I remember it is a part of learning, I have not connected between the symbols.) Thank you Duyen

file: A scholarship; last dream id: D0063; Date of dream: Friday, September 8, 2023 Angel: 33 Yehuiah State of mind: Uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Prof. Anthony and Dr. Mayur This week, I have a mouth sore . It is uncomfortable to do some activities related to the mouth like eating and talking. It lets me understand the symbolic meaning of "mouth" in the Source Code. These days, I do not arrange my time correctly. I do not take care of myself enough. I just go to work, read Chinese stories, and sleep a little. I would like to share with you one of the stories I read. The story is about a female military doctor who comes to the past to practice herself and become the master of medicine and energy. The pluses and minuses are as below: +: The story shows the law of karma. You reap what you sow. The bad people do the bad things to her. They got the bad things after that. Some people are led by their instinctual needs, greed so they do the bad things. Although they get some opportunities to fix their mistakes, they do not realize them clearly so they make another mistake. The main character is patient and tries to improve her knowledge. -: The main character hurts the people who harmed her in return, she continues her cycle of life instead of ending her cycle. When she uses violence to get back justice. The story lets the readers think that it is fair. The story does not show her past life and her next life. She needs to use her love and wisdom to do the right thing when others do not do the right thing for her. The Chinese are famous for their talent that they can read and sense others. In the plus, it gives us the capacity to help , others and commute in the right way. In the minuses, they abuse others to get the things they want. I think the story should be explained with the Universal Law to give readers a global vision. I saw an effect on myself when I had negative thoughts about a person related to jealousy, anger, and disrespect within this period of time. The way I nourish myself, the way I manifest. Reading stories, playing games, or watching videos... should be considered carefully. , when I choose Besides to read stories, I escape and isolate myself from the right things I should do like studying and building my relationships, ... I fall into a lazy state. I should review my intention in every activity. I remember a sentence from a UCM book: The spiritual person can choose to do the right thing and reject doing the wrong things. Apart from me Analyzes and makes the decision to stop doing that but in reality, I still continue to choose the wrong thing. September 07 is the anniversary of my ex-relationship. Until now I am still sensitive and sad sometimes, I should let it go but I have not done it. On that day, my energy became low, I did not want to do anything. I would like to recontact but my mind does not allow that. Could you explain what is wrong with me? What should I fix? What do I need to do? Sometimes, I feel guilty when I repeat the same things after many helps from you :( :( :(. At my work, my boss required me to report on the coffee project: what I would do for it in the future on October 02. I have managed a small coffee vendor with 5 members, but the profit is not well. I want to give up because I don't know what to do with it. Everything is blurred with me in this area. I have just built some processes to operate it since October 17, 2022. In the last piece of advice from you, I can meditate on the symbolic meaning of ant. I do not know how to work with my team, I would like to give them more opportunities to develop themselves but I am not ready to communicate with them. I have a tendency to keep a distance from them and just build the processes to let them follow. I have a dream as below: I was sitting at a computer with Linh Thao and a female. We were discussing UCM and my tuition. Because I did not have enough money, Linh Thao decided to give me a scholarship . I felt uncomfortable. Thank you Duyen

file: A fire; last dream id: D0064; Date of dream: Thursday, September 14, 2023 Angel: 34 Lehahiah State of mind: Surprise Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Prof. Anthony and Dr. Mayur, I received a message from my ex-boyfriend's mother. She visited HCM city from her hometown. She invited me to meet her at my ex-boyfriend's uncle's house, which I visited many times when he and I were a couple. I felt happy when she was here. But I had a thought if it was right that I visited that place. In the beginning, I thought my ex-boyfriend and I now become friends so it was okay. When I thought more, did I create an misunderstanding when I tried to make our relationship normal at this time? Am I trying to cover my intention to save my relationship? Am I trying to look normal? Do I respect the breaking decision? I asked the Up Above and I received this dream. I would like to analyze it as below: I was in an unknown area (a house having some rooms and surrounded by forest) with Oanh (DSSI student) , her daughter, her son-in- law, and An (my direct manager) . The daughter and the son-in-law have just had a marriage . The son-in-law was misguided among the rooms, he almost went to Oanh's room. I knew that Oanh and An used to be a couple. Their relationship was broken because of a misunderstanding. I encouraged them to reconnect but I realized that An has a new wife, Truc now. In the next scene, a man took Oanh's two children into a forest and he used fire to harm them. The fire made the two children's hands burn. At this time, Oanh and An were talking together . When she could not find her children in the house, I appointed her the children's address. She drove a pickup truck and saved her children. But a man took his pickup truck. She and her children went out of the forest with many people. They were angry because they didn't have a car to move out. These days, sometimes, I see my hope for our relationship. It's still there. I am not ready to go out so I know it is not the right time to meet my ex-boyfriend's mother. Thank you for your support Duyen

The daughter and the son-in-law have just had a marriage . The son-in-law was misguided among the rooms, he almost went to Oanh's room. I knew that Oanh and An used to be a couple. Their relationship was broken because of a misunderstanding. I encouraged them to reconnect but I realized that An has a new wife, Truc now. In the next scene, a man took Oanh's two children into a forest and he used fire to harm them. The fire made the two children's hands burn. At this time, Oanh and An were talking together . When she could not find her children in the house, I appointed her the children's address. She drove a pickup truck and saved her children. But a man took his pickup truck. She and her children went out of the forest with many people. They were angry because they didn't have a car to move out.",

file: Try clothes; last dream id: D0065; Date of dream: Saturday, September 23, 2023 Angel: 61 Umabel State of mind: Confused Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Prof. Anthony and Dr. Mayur I met my ex-boyfriend's mother at a coffee store last Sunday. We had a nice conversation. And I feel happy when I read your guide for this matter in the portal today. I also know that my ex-boyfriend has bronchial tuberculosis. He must heal within 6 months. Two of his uncles used to have tuberculosis. I wonder what is the meaning of the sick. Tuberculosis is spread through the respiratory tract when the body is not healthy. This sickness lets a person have more time to nourish himself rightly from within. Am I resonating with him when I and he are not in a relationship at this time? I would like to analyze this dream as below: I was in a room of a clothing store with Truc , her daughter , and some people on Sunday . All the clothes were hung up on the left side. The king bed was in the middle of the room. I will try clothes on the right side. I tried on many different shirts to find a shirt for the skirt that I liked and it had many patterns. Within my trying clothes, there were some people bringing something to the room. They lay on the bed to do something. I didn't feel shy but I was insecure about losing something because the room was too crowded. At the end of the day, I could not find a suitable skirt. Truc invited me to go to a party but I refused because I was busy to go. Thank you Duyen

file: A cozy mood; last dream id: D0066; Date of dream: Tuesday, September 19, 2023 Angel: 61 Umabel State of mind: uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Prof. Anthony and Dr. Mayur I feel happy to read your guide from my last dream journal. I see the dream and the training guiding me to take further steps in my life. Last weekend, our company had a trip. We played, ate, and studied together. The course we studied from my boss is about How to give a comment to someone. The principle like the UCM knowledge is 8 compliments and 2 comments. I thought it was time to apply this principle deeply in my life. She studied a lot from many courses during this period time. She shared with us for example: energy, music affects energy, and developing ourselves, ... Our team is more connected after sharing their evaluation about three aspects: personal, family, and work, and their wish to improve them. The sharing has minuses and pluses. A minus part of it is related to insecurity, needs, and lack of wisdom ... but it is a beautiful step (tendency). I will have a meeting with my team to apply this knowledge deeply. This week, I completed the story I read. I come back to a normal life with a good schedule. I ask myself why I feel empty after finishing the story. And I will meditate on it deeply and share you to receive your support. A part of it is related to instinctual needs, a need for someone to love me and give me fidelity, caring, and being aside... It compensates my lack inside of me. Today, my roommate invited me to paint a picture following a video. It is a simple picture of the flower in the air. I feel a bit difficult because it should be the stiff strokes instead of loose, soft strokes. I thought it was like how I give something, sometimes it lacks softness and flexibility. On my coming home, I see a mother carrying her child in the rain. I remember my mother used to do that when I was a child. It took me to another memory. My mom said to me and many people many times that If she did not carry me from kindergarten every afternoon, her business would be better. It becomes a negative memory for me. I felt sad when I was a reason for something bad. It lets me see the insecurity of my mother makes her give a wrong notion of love to me. Sometimes, I let my insecurity lead me to take action. I would like to analyze this dream as below: I was in Nhi's boarding house . I visited and stayed for a day. Y had just transferred there to live. I found a way to visit Y's bedsit . Her room was comfortable, cool, and beautiful but she was a little bit embarrassed when I visited. I made an appointment with my high school friends in the room of someone. I arrived early and sat on the mat waiting for everyone. The room was on the 1st floor having two big doors and a window to look at a garden. Trang came but she sat at the table with some friends from Math class, most of whom were male. They also had an appointment today. They were surprised when they saw me. I had the intention to let them move to another room because this room was not available for them. But I didn't talk to them because I felt embarrassed. Thank you Duyen

file: A coffee kiosk; last dream id: D0067; Date of dream: Monday, September 25, 2023 Angel: 37 Aniel State of mind: Strange, uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Prof. Anthony and Dr. Mayur, I continued to read the Chinese story I shared with you in the previous dream journal. I had some dreams related to it. But they were so strange and magical so I did not believe they were a real dream. I refused to write them down as dreams. I think they were illusions in my mind. Last night I couldn't have a full sleep. I see many scenes from the story. Every scene makes me wake up once. Does it come from the way I read too much? I understand it shows me a part of my memories, a part of my unconscious. I should learn from them under the symbolic language. They are showing my conscious not just weird stuff under the Law of Resonance. Sometimes, I see myself thinking deeply about it at a moment but I do not write it down. Should I write down and meditate on an image by another image? I would like to share with you this dream for this week as below: Nhi and I were in a coffee kiosk at the woman's house I knew in my hometown. We are sellers. At this point, many customers ordered. There was a girl who bought two phone sims . I was very rushed and I felt a lot of pressure. When there are many parts coming to a moment. I lost my control. I want to do everything as quickly as possible to let them go and not wait for me. I became careless and clumsy at that point. I am scared that they will be angry when I let them wait. I study to be patient to serve them and in a professional them without focusing too much on the result of making them pleasure. At this time, my team member also shared with me the difficulty. I have not guided them rightly. I try to find a way to improve our service process instead of letting them share and have the right intention and attitude. Then a man from my government required me to buy 10 tickets to support an event at the Mid Autumn festival. I also said sorry to a customer for our late service. I took 10 tickets to Quan and suggested we could buy 4 of them. He is not serious about my suggestion. 4 tickets were 200,000 VND but he just gave me 2,000 VND. He joked a few times before giving me the correct amount. I came back to the coffee counter. There was a little mess. There was also a customer asking me why the tree line was lower than normal. I talked to him a little bit. When I returned, I saw Quan was sleeping on the ground behind a table. Thank you Duyen

file: Continue to ask the guide from the Up Above; last dream id: D0068; Date of dream: Friday, October 13, 2023 Angel: 32 Vasariah State of mind: Complex Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Prof. Anthony and Dr. Mayur, This week, I worked with Angel Vasariah and the intention of "Is my ex-boyfriend the right person for me?". I have some dreams but I remember too little. I almost forgot them. I think one of the reasons IN SOME% is my resistance and lack of receiving. My aunt invited me and my cousin to visit her house when her husband was not at home. She usually invites us when her husband has business travel. Because she does not want him to meet us when she has us and he also has a lot of relatives. If her family invites us, it means her family must invite other relatives. I want to analyze this dream when I visit my aunt's family as below: I dreamed of my aunt's family. My aunt's family has 4 members: my aunt . , my uncle ., Quynh and Uyen . They try to hide their intention to kill me. When I discovered that, I felt scared. My aunt and my uncle focus on taking care of their children at the physical level like studying and eating more than their emotions or thoughts. I understand they are doing the best on their base. I respect that. My aunt's family lets me see those parts of me. I have memories related to marrying without true love and wisdom. The insecurity and the effect of social life led me to make the wrong decision. Killing lets me see the effect of that on me. I should rectify my memories to be more loved, more wise, and more patient to make the right decision. My mother told me about her doubts about my niece. Because, in our hometown, there is a couple with two children. The man discovered that the two children were not his. He felt shocked about this. I asked myself what it meant and why my mother had a resonance with that, what I should do. My mom and my sister-in-law are not good to each other. They have a lot of conflicts. It is not right to hide the truth, infidelity at the point of I received this news. They are learning their lesson. My mother has an insecurity related to infidelity in her memory so she has a resonance like this. These days, my mother has many negative memories. I study how to listen to her stories without judging and giving advice. I am not sure she is ready to listen to my point of view. Sometimes, I understand listening without judging is a way to be more receptive and help others feel comfortable without dramatizing. I hope my mother can be happier and happier but she is learning and I should respect her rhythm without forcing. I used to want to fix other relationships. But they come to help us learn to be a better person. Besides, I discovered that when I shared knowledge with my brother at the wrong time, it made my brother keep a distance from me. He does not answer my questions when I would like to reconnect after that. I also study a way to build the relationship between me and my brother. At the physical level, my ex-boyfriend's cousin and her husband made an appointment with me. We ate and drank some beer. She asked me about my breaking. I told her I and my ex-boyfriend have pluses and minuses. My ex-boyfriend thing to stop, and I have had feelings for him until now. Then my ex-boyfriend appeared. He looked slimmer than before. He had just drunk wine with his colleagues. He has still drunk beers although he is sick - pulmonary tuberculosis as I shared. We talk naturally about some activities with each other. I felt a little bit uncomfortable at the beginning then peaceful, and happy during this experience. After that, we went to karaoke. During this period time, I invoked Angel Vasariah in my mind every moment I was alone to let me do the right thing in this situation. I slept at his cousin's house. When I slept on the couch, suddenly I felt someone look at me. I opened my eyes and saw my ex-boyfriend looking at me. I lost control and asked him how he felt about our relationship now. He said he still has feelings for me. I shared my feelings related to sad to him after his decision but I respect his choice. I asked him which option he chose for now. He needed more time and he will answer me later. We hugged each other. I see the difficulty of committing changes in the way we think, feel, and act. I have just received a dream last night so I would like to share it deeply in the PR 32 Vasariah. I respect it and at this time, our conditions are not suitable for making a decision. Until now, I continue to invoke and ask the most important question. I do not want to rebuild a wrong relationship between him and me. The situation has a minus tendency when we use beer I would like to receive your advice in this case. Thank you Duyen

file: Receptivity; last dream id: D0069; Date of dream: Friday, October 20, 2023 Angel: 39 Rehael State of mind: Surprise Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Prof. Anthony and Dr. Mayur I have an introspection this week. I had some dreams when I invoked the Angel Rehael - the birth angel of my ex-boyfriend at the emotional level and asked if he was the right person. The more I concentrated on working on myself, the more I could receive dreams. I received an invitation to visit his grandfather from his grandfather through my ex-boyfriend. I am happy to see the grandfather because he is wise and has good communication. The grandfather spent his time asking me the reason for breaking and offering help but I let him know it was a break and my ex-boyfriend and I would make a decision. On the way I came home, I had many questions for myself like "Do I cover something? How do I feel?" I am worried that I am not right in this situation. Sometimes, I felt anger when my ex-boyfriend did not communicate clearly with me about our relationship. I also have an expectation of receiving his message. I have negative thoughts when he keeps silent. I also received dreams from Up Above about my anger and my rebellion in some aspects. I am so touched and I understand I should work on my negative memories. These days, I am noticing the sound and the cleaning in my work area. Some people will let the fireproof steel door with a door closer close automatically. The sound is too loud and I'm not too fond of the sound. I try to close the door gently and respect others' choices in this case. A person from the next office let me know that she could hear my conversation from my office because of poor sound insulation. I have become careful in my actions. That afternoon, my action was too intense when my colleague let the door close automatically. When I let my colleague know about poor sound insulation while she was complaining angrily about the restroom, she said she wanted the person doing the wrong action to know that but I rejected it. She can give a suggestion to the building management to remind other actions instead of complaining like that. But she doesn't want to do this. The way of my communication at that point is not right. She becomes scared and tries to close the door gently when she goes into the office. This week, I would like to analyze one of my dreams below: I joined a meeting with my father and my brother . There was a rude woman who abused power and was sitting high up with two lines of tables below. I sat on the left side. My father and my brother sit on the right side. My brother sat behind my father. The woman asked my father a question but my father looked a little bit lacking in alertness. He was confused. I wrote down the question in the paper and gave it to him. He can't see it clearly. My brother helped him by pressing each word strongly with a bottle to let my father read it. Then I had another dream that night: I see a network of many points in the Universe. Every point is yellow. They have a connection with each other. Every point is a positive feeling of the same person but I can not remember. Sometimes, the network is attacked. Thank you Duyen

file: A Fall; last dream id: D0076; Date of dream: Thursday, October 26, 2023 Angel: 57 Nemamiah State of mind: Alarmed Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Prof. Anthony and Dr. Mayur, Thank you for your advice. I was looking forward to receiving your revision. I felt slightly shocked and disappointed after reading the revision of the DJ "Continue...". I invoked the angel Nemamiah and continued asking one question until receiving the DJ "Receptivity" revision. :) I feel more free to discover myself and accept anything to come to me. There is nothing to make me think now we can be a couple if we do not rectify our memories. I am more intellectual than emotional. This week, my workplace in the building had fire alarms due to a position under construction causing dust on the smoke detector. Some of the people who work together in the building ran out. The others still stayed at the same place to call the building management board. Some of them felt angry. In the beginning, I felt guilty for these mistakes. I am working on the building management board but we are not professional. I also used to think our technical team was not good in these cases. I found the reason why it happens angrily. Then, my colleague also shared her scared after hearing that sound when we had lunch and she thought we were not professional when we made the same mistake. At that point, I thought again and said to her that we heard enough complaints from the customers, we would find solutions and we needed more compassion to be better. I discovered that I was too harsh in this case, and then I felt more receptive and more comfortable when the Up Above gave me the case. Besides, our technical team had a meeting to improve the next time. I also have a question about how we call the name of a feeling rightly. I am so confused about the emotional states. Sometimes, I use the word "Normal" to avoid calling the true feelings. What should I do to this matter? I can step by calling out my feelings when I have time, right? I would like to share the dream I received below: My ex-boyfriend and I came to a roadside diner . It was dark. I felt very hungry and I wanted to eat. I thought a lot about eating chive soup cake / NOT ( . We also have a table near the road There was an elder woman who was driving a motorbike to cross a small slope in the distance. The slope was between two rows of trees. She got a trouble at that place and someone helped her. She was rich with a lot of land but she looked unhappy and miserable. Then, 3 little boys came to sit at our table. They called chive soup cake so I also wanted it but my ex-boyfriend did not give me enough attention. Suddenly one of the 3 boys answered a call. He quickly crossed to the right side. The road was wet. He ran very quickly to hug something coming. He slipped and fell. We saw his dog . The dog ran after him when he left his home. Then he and the dog came to us. We were waiting a long time but we did not see our food. Thank you very much. I am more mature when I step into this journey with your support. Duyen

file: My angry; last dream id: D0077; Date of dream: Friday, November 3, 2023 Angel: 44 Yelahiah State of mind: Tired Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Prof Anthony and Dr Mayur, Through your revision, I realized that sometimes I focus on my needs, I neglect other aspects of my life including my family, work, colleagues, and friends ... It is an opportunity to arrange my life to build a balanced life. I work with my birth angel at the emotional level - 44 Yelahiah. And I received a dream: My mother , my younger brother , and I rented two rooms to live on the top of a slope. The surrounding area was peaceful and had a lot of trees with a few houses. My mother wanted to go out so my brother and I took her out. Before we left, the owner informed us that her daughter was sick suddenly so she would take the rooms back earlier. We stopped on the side of the road with a lot of flowers. I took many beautiful pictures of my mother by an app. When my phone storage was low, I used the normal camera and the pictures were not beautiful anymore. When I talked something to my mom, she had a stomach ache . She became angry and impatient so we went back. On the way back, my younger brother drove me on the bike. My mom drove another bike. They ran fast on the narrow concrete road and continuously went up and downhill. At a corner, there was a supermarket and we went through it. When we came to our room, we saw a baby sleeping on the bed with her father. I was informed that the television in the room was special. So I wanted to know. I opened and closed quickly to not let the baby wake up. At 3:26 am one day, I received a dream. I wanted to write it. So I woke up and I didn't remember this dream. What happened in this case? And these days I have difficulty remembering and writing down my dreams. What should I do? I have a special week when my emotion is too sensitive. I am easy to feel angry. Today, I will have a meeting with my coffee team. It was the first time we met full of members. I will do the best for myself and our team with the first intention of developing qualities. Besides, I would like to hear your advice. My ex-boyfriend and I have talked again. He still has a feeling for me, he is still scared. I do not want to repeat the same mistake. I give myself and him 4 months to be a friend. I missed some of my important things when I was not brave enough to show my spiritual path in the period we were a couple. I would like to show a part of it to him and improve our communication ability. I have complex feelings because I am worried that I will do the wrong things and hurt myself and him. Thank you Duyen

file: A lesson; last dream id: D0078; Date of dream: Friday, November 10, 2023 Angel: 46 Ariel State of mind: uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Prof. Anthony and Dr. Mayur Thank you for your advice. It is like a lighthouse to let me do the right things more and more. Through your revision, I deeply understand my dream. For the relationship, I feel vague when I don't know how to build a relationship in the right way. I am more open to sharing my opinions and my feelings with him. How do I share the UCM knowledge with respect to its speed? I am scared that I am pushing him, forcing him to do the things I want. , I am on the way to learn the UCM knowledge and I have not applied full of it, . Last night, I joined my manager's birthday party with my colleagues. My mind had had a thought related to I would drink beers and let my boyfriend come and pick me up from the party. I drank a lot of beer and lost control. My boyfriend picked me up and he took care of me. I was too drunk and vomited. The next day, I felt exhausted and embarrassed and I did not want to make the same mistake. I also see a short dream like an image related to my grandfather and my father at my grandfather's house when I wake up. I asked myself why I had a plan like that in my mind. Is it from my emotional dependency, a lack of love from within, or too much instinctive need? I would like to analyze a dream I had: I had a plan to come to the UCM office for the MyEQ event. I visited my grandfather's house . The area of my grandfather's house was like a peninsula . Every road connecting the mainland with the area was under repair. When I went on a road, I must wade a little bit. I came to a house. There were 3 people - a neighbor, a man, and a person. I stayed a little bit. Then I went deeper into the house and I saw the man was taking a shower in the bathroom so I closed the door, left and did not say goodbye. I discovered that it was 10 am , and the MyEQ event began. I ran fast and lost. Then some people guided me but I must wade into a deep puddle . I was confused and scared to use this road. I didn't see anyone cross it. Thank you Duyen.

file: The House in a Forest; last dream id: D0080; Date of dream: Tuesday, November 14, 2023 Angel: 31 Lecabel State of mind: Dangerous Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Prof Anthony and Dr Mayur I have an insecurity within, so sometimes, I persuaded myself that meeting my boyfriend was normal. If we do not become a couple, I will not hurt anymore. At first time, I thought it was the right thing until I saw myself avoiding some situations or repressing my thoughts or my feelings to talk with him. I am standing at the door, and one of my feet is ready to go out. My colleagues at lunchtime also told me a couple was broken, the woman had a new relationship but she also had sex with the ex-boyfriend. The ex-boyfriend knew that but he said he did not lose anything so he accepted. Some people are scared to commit and meet their compensation or instinctual needs, so they keep a couple relationship. I want to analyze this dream: My ex-boyfriend and I visited an ancient house for a few days. The house belonged to a man and his mother but his mother was not there at that time. The man also took her girlfriend to his house with us. 4 people My ex-boyfriend and I came out one time. The place was insecure. It was in a deserted forest with small and narrow roads. The owner was dangerous when he said some bad things so we found a way to let the three of us leave the house earlier. The girlfriend of the owner was very scared and she also wanted to leave as quickly as possible. Besides my mother also told me about my sister-in-law when she and her child came back to my home from her house to let my mother help her take care of the child and she went to work. Through my mother's stories, I understand she was tired and she felt unsatisfied with my sister-in-law's actions. She is repressing all her feelings within herself. My brother and my sister-in-law have a big conflict and every time they exchange they become explode. I am far away from my family so I do not know the full stories of family members. What should I do in this case? My family needs love but they are too heavy with it. Thank you Duyen

I often wake up at night because I can't breathe smoothly and need to sneeze. Could you help me to explain this matter symbolically? I want to analyze this dream as below: I stayed in an unknown place where I would learn and live with my friends. I lost 2 times when I found a way to go to the toilet . The first time, I turned in the wrong direction The second time, I went with Tin - my old friend I was angry with him. We even went out of that place. Then we must use the main road to come back. In the next scene, my classroom has a short rest time. I was tired so I went to my room with two friends. Two friends still wanted to return to the class while I was lazy on my bed. In the next scene, there was a fight between two male friends and another in a room. They were hurt. Other people must find a way to take them to the hospital. One of the three friends called a female friend "a mother" so other people told her that it was the right choice, she was criticized. Yesterday, my boss shared our personalities when she was studying a course. She mentioned my pluses and my weakness - too much anger. Sometimes, my anger shows in my work strongly. I see a little bit of resistance when I get this information. Then I accept that it is a part of myself and I am on the way to improving. I have an opportunity to receive comments from my boss and my manager to become a better version. I am also careful not to repress my feelings. It is the final dream journal of this year. I am so grateful and thank you for your guidance, companionship, and patience...I get your explanation with your love and wisdom. It encourages me to step further on the spiritual journey. I wish that all the best things for you. Thank you Duyen

file: Praying for a lucky one; last dream id: D0082; Date of dream: Friday, February 16, 2024 Angel: 65 Damabiah State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Prof Eloi This week, I would like to share one of my difficulties when I came home. I spent a Tet Holiday in my hometown. This year I became more conscious when I was home. I observed my family and am studying to record my members' pluses. Sometimes, I felt uncomfortable when I saw the wrong thing from them. I tried to use the Law of Resonance and recite the Mantra, at the beginning, Dabamiah but it was too heavy and dense in my heart so I chanted Dabamiah and Haziel. I am studying to respect the rhythm of my family members. The weight was big. I still had a desire to talk out my thoughts when my mother or my father complained about someone or something. Sometimes, I do not want to come back home or I want to live in my home in a short time. My family wants to live in love but we repress things so we do not have a neutral conversation about any topic. When we must say something, it has a lot of emotions esp anger, frustration, and pushing. I have difficulty feeling the love from my family and giving the right love to my family. What should I do to change it? On the 2nd day of the Tet Holiday, the weather became colder with great winds. It is the coldest day in this period. My father had a stroke last August. On that day, he trembled and felt so cold. He also got diarrhea . This was the first time I saw him like that. It affects me a lot. I felt worried about his health. I reminded myself it was a lesson we needed to have. Besides, these days, my right leg was too tired as if I ran a lot. My head was not clear and sometimes, I felt dizzy. I remember a dream I received as below: I was preparing for an exam . There were 3 classes. I was in the middle class. Before testing, a teacher required me to pray for good luck. I followed the guide. I took out the number 43 after praying. Additionally, I am forcing myself too much, to always do the right things. I am also on the way to discovering myself and I should give love, and softness to myself rightly. Thank you Duyen

file: A big snake; last dream id: D0083; Date of dream: Wednesday, February 21, 2024 Angel: 67 Eyael State of mind: Feeling scared, ambiguity Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Eloi This week, I have just stepped into a new age. It gives me a feeling to consider what I want to build long-term. I ask myself what my life program is for this life. I received the wishes and the gifts from my family, my friends, and my colleagues. It marks a special day with beautiful feelings like love, courage, and care, ... I am more receptive than the previous years and have fewer expectations from the outside. I also wish I were braver to continue going deeply into my unconscious and rectifying the negative memories. I am bothered about my work. My present job is not related to my major in the long term so I want to change to another job. For finding a new job, I have some negative memories that need to rectify. I am learning to be confident with the things I can do. , the economics is besides more challenging than before. It requests the capacity to use the resources reasonably and rightly. What should I need to do to be right at the matter level and also the metaphysical level? I understand that developing qualities should be the most important goal in every job. It is not a coincidence that I have a present job. I appreciate it but I also need to advance to be more effective, to be learning more in the major of Supply Chain. This major is more interesting to me but I also doubt if it is the right thing for my life program. I would like to analyze a dream as below: It was a beautiful place . There was a forest surrounding a lake . There were some people divided into two groups. I was taken from a group that would go to the left to another group that would go to the right. In the group, there was a father and a mother . We must attack a big animal . I had not seen it fully. A part of the animal was a snake . It made me scared so much. Thank you Duyen

file: An aggressive man; last dream id: D0084; Date of dream: Wednesday, February 28, 2024 Angel: 46 Ariel State of mind: scared Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Eloi Could you give me a guide? My ex-boyfriend and I ended our relationship nearly 1 year ago. The reason as he said is that he felt too much pressure with too much responsibility to be married when he was 29 years old and I was 31 years old. I accepted his choice. The last October, we decided to have 4 months to review our relationship because we had feelings with each other. The time is coming and I need to decide on ending or continuing. I asked the Up Above and received some dreams. Those dreams are guiding me to rectify my memories more than answer the question directly. What should I do in this case? Besides, sometimes, I feel uncomfortable with my boyfriend's actions but I am not ready to discuss it with him. A part of it comes from my perceptions, my memories and I do not want to project it on him esp when I receive the dreams related to my negative memories and he is not a spiritual person at this time. I would like to share with you one of those dreams below: I was in a strange place like my grandfather's house. There were me, my older sister, my younger sister, and my boyfriend, a total of 4 . An aggressive, violent, dangerous man with his henchmen came into my house and controlled our family to serve them. The man demanded sex with my sisters and I was hiding in my house. One time, I was hiding under the bed when he and a woman had sex. I was so scared to be found out. After that, I sat in the cupboard like a statue with a feather duster . There was a hole in the cupboard door. A housekeeper and a cleaning person looked into the hole. They thought of me like a real statue so they did not cover me. Then the aggressive man had a party world. My family wanted me to make up for myself to attack him. After the gang left, I came out of the cupboard but felt completely exhausted and sat on the floor . My boyfriend and my older sister sat on the bed and continued requiring me to prepare. Do I understand a symbolism will show a different state of consciousness depending on the context? When I read it in a Source Code, sometimes, I feel connected with some states but sometimes I do not see the connection. I also see my anger and the instinctive needs in some of my dreams, I invoke the Angel to work on them but it still appears. How could I transform it rightly? Thank you Duyen

Then the aggressive man had a party world. My family wanted me to make up for myself to attack him. After the gang left, I came out of the cupboard but felt completely exhausted and sat on the floor. My boyfriend and my older sister sat on the bed and continued requiring me to prepare.",

file: A meeting; last dream id: D0085; Date of dream: Friday, March 8, 2024 Angel: 70 Jabamiah State of mind: uncomfortable, worried Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Prof Eloi Thank you for your guide in the last DJ. It gives me a bigger picture. I am reconsidering my intention when I want to be in a couple. I would like to analyze one of my dreams as below: On behalf of Mr. An , I met a female customer to show her the office for rent on the second floor of the building . There was me, one safeguard , the customer, and her child . 4 in total The office also includes a stair outside the building and a separate section located near the building. I am not sure of the right location of the section because, along our building, there were some stores . So I left the customer with the security guard and went to the security booth on the ground floor to ask for the position. A safeguard who was a newbie sitting in the booth and checking the cameras for the building did not know the position like me. I required him to contact the chief of the safeguarding team, Mr. Thang , in an uncomfortable and hurry. I came into one of the stores randomly, but two women like the owners who were sitting just looked at me but did not say anything. I thought it was wrong then I came out. The customer and her two children came to me. I was nervous and asked her to wait for me. She had a tendency not to wait anymore. Her children would like to go to the restroom so I guided them to return to the ladder and turn right. I found out the position of the section after Mr. Thang guided me. It was at the nearest of the safeguarding booth but it was at the corner of a road so there were too many vehicles moving. I should contact Mr. An to receive the position information quickly. And after this dream, this afternoon, I was updated by one of my team members about cheating in selling. I am managing a business - a coffee kiosk with 1 full-time member and 4 part-time members. The full-time member said that she saw a weirdness in the bills. Someone had to cancel a bill to receive the cash. After checking the history of the bills, I am so sure about the cheating. Because the coffee kiosk does not have a camera, I am not sure who is cheating but it is not a right action so I would like to do the right thing. Thank you The Duyen

file: An intense week when I go out too much; last dream id: D0086; Date of dream: Friday, March 15, 2024 Angel: 31 Lecabel State of mind: uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Prof Eloi After the cheating story last week, I had many feelings sometimes I felt scared, unbelievable, shocked, and angry, sometimes, I was more accepted that something needed to change. I also asked why they did it. I found the solutions from my manager, friends who have businesses like me, the internet ... And I was confused about "What should I do to the story? Do I need to find out the cheater? Do I only need to change the process instead of going into the problem? ...". Just a small problem, it activates more and more insecurity and fears of communication. I chose to work with Angel Lecabel. I want to share with you my story of this week. On one of my mornings, I had a dream: I met Thoa . She ạchieved something. I congratulated her when she was sitting in the back seat of the car and leaving. That evening, at the physical level, I arranged a date with my friend who manages two tea-milk stores to ask about her experiences at one of her stores. That night, she was too busy. Sometimes, she was with her store, sometimes, she was with her friend, and sometimes, she was with me. At the end of the evening, she spent two hours sharing and helping me with my problems to work with my team. But I wanted to leave because I wanted to come home and go to the restroom. Because of her enthusiastic sharing, I delayed my needs. When I left her store, it was too late. When I came home from her place to my house, I got lost and ran around. I lost sleep . I became too hyperactive and wanted to make changes to the coffee shop immediately. I invoked Lecabel to be more patient. When I become hyperactive, too-down-to-earth, I want to solve any problem as soon as possible => lack respect for the rhythm, and be preserved with wisdom - the Law of Resonance and Evil is educational. Then the next day, I was too tired and forced the coffee business and my team to some new rules and processes with negative emotions. I projected on my team and created a bad atmosphere in the coffee store. I continued losing sleep. My nose could not breathe normally, and I felt uncomfortable on the left, and then in the middle of the night, my discomfort from left to right. Now I understand why I got sick now, I am calm to rectify my negative memories. These stories are the same as your advice I need to step by step but it must begin from within with the right intention - developing qualities. Thank you Duyen

Every of your guides lets me know which memory I keep. It is not easy to accept and sometimes, I feel impatient. Today, I would like to share you a dream as below: I was normal on the way from my company to my rented room . The police caught me so I found another way. . I felt hesitant when I drove into a strange road I saw my brother and some people crossing me. I followed them and I drove to the end of that road. It was a government building. I drove up some floors by stairs but I could not find the way out. I had the intention to fly across a wall. Finally, I ran to the back of the building to get out. The owner of this building caught and asked me. I was very annoyed. I was wrong but still stiff, uncooperative.

file: A self-driving motorbike; last dream id: D0088; Date of dream: Friday, March 22, 2024 Angel: 31 Lecabel State of mind: weird, happy Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Prof Eloi I would like to share my dream for this week: I drive a motorbike with a 3-year-old male child to discover a forest . The first half was okay. We saw a round place with a lot of mud under maintenance. I was confused whether we should continue or not. Some people at that place guided me and others to cross it. I decided to leave the motorbike and try to cross by walking with him. We can use the motorbike later because it can be remoted and self-driving. After going deeply, we were lost and came to a strange place. I called the motorbike but I still had not seen it. We received help from a male stranger. He guided us to the big road and we met a friend who was also lost like us. We continued to move and met some people with my motorbike. The motorbike was lying on the ground with the broken back wheel . They were waiting to find the owner. I put the wife of the head of that place. She required me to meet the head. I brought my vehicle registration to meet the head and told my stories while his wife was taking a shower . The head explained the state of my motorbike and helped me fix it. Then some friends who were the same my age came to the front of the house to play some games with me. One of them also gave me a gift to bring back. I was so grateful for them. I am confused about how I can interpret this dream. It is negative at the beginning but it appears the positive aspects when I receive help from the parts of my unconscious. Could you help me explain it? Thank you Duyen

file: A party; last dream id: D0089; Date of dream: Thursday, March 28, 2024 Angel: 2 Jeliel State of mind: too much scared Dream and analysis: Hello Dear Prof Eloi The last dream helps me understand better what I am doing. I mostly forgot the important aspect of that dream. I would like to analyze a dream I received this week when I worked with Angel Jeliel. It was too intense for me and I tried to wake up after this dream. The dream is as below: I visited an unknown place where my male friends lived to join a birthday party in the evening. They were my old friends: Hoang , Nguyen , Quang , Nam and some others from my secondary school. After the party, I slept there. Their place did not have a private area for me, so I was in the same room with them. They separated into two groups and slept at two corners of the room. I had a vague fear of being touched by one of them. Nam touched from my foot upward. Quang saw that and reminded him not to do it but he continued. I ran out of this place. I walked on the right side of the road. There was an old man who noticed me and he ran to me with bad intentions. I was so scared so I ran to the left side of the road. Many vehicles were crossing us. He caught me. He hugged me and tried to push me to the pavement. I was too scared and screamed. He did not stop and he was like a snake hugged at my belly. I stabbed him with a pen on the top of his head. On the physical level, I also have the same fear. When I am in a place with a man, I am scared the person may touch me indecently. It is one of my lessons in this life. There were some wrong touches from some older man when I was a child. I didn't say to my parents. I was too scared to say it to my parents. It became an obsession in my psychology. When I was a student, it was even worse. I lived with my friend and she had a boyfriend. In the beginning, I let her boyfriend sleep with us. They also had sex while I slept. One day, her boyfriend touched my body. I let him do it without saying No or anything else and I only felt scared and ashamed. After a while, I also had sex with him when he was still in a relationship with my friend and another woman. I was terrible at that time and sometimes, I felt no light to solve it. Until one day, I was brave to say No to him. I escaped many times but now I want to face it and rectify it rightly. I put these situations because I needed to learn from them. Not to hurt others to satisfy my instinctual needs. Sex is not a bad thing but a person needs wisdom. I learn the way to master instinctual needs constantly by meditation, and doing mantras. I also learned to say No rightly when it should be. The people who appeared in my life did it to me to help me learn this lesson and they used to be victims by me. I need to accept and stop tormenting myself. It is a process to be a better version. I hurt others because of a lack of wisdom and now I bring light into my life to do the right thing. I used a lot of words "fear" in this DJ. It touches deeply about who I was, who I am, and who I will be. Thank you very much Duyen

file: Lost; last dream id: D0090; Date of dream: Friday, April 5, 2024 Angel: 3 Sitael State of mind: uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Hello Dear Pro Eloi This week, I was attracted by Korean comics related to romantic love and reincarnation. I watched a part of the comics review through the short videos and then I found the full link of the comics on the Internet. It happened every night after I finished my work this week. The stories are sometimes related to a woman who can be free to do the things she wants or a woman who has a lot of talent and gets attracted by others. It shows that the limited within me when I wanted to be free. Besides, I also want to receive recognition from others. I should work on myself to transcend them and be more disciplined to do the right things. In my work, two of my team members had a conflict. They use the silence to solve their problem and I am the person who gives them some advice to solve it. One of them told me the stories. On the one side, she gave me the whole story from her perspective. On the other hand, she thought she was a harsh person. It is not right when I only focus on the negative things so I try to find the positive things. I repeat the mantra and I am more balanced when I have a conversation with one of them. I do not push them to change immediately, I give them more time to consider it carefully. Besides, I discovered that her communication can make others feel hurt. I refer back to myself and realize that I am also like that. I should be more gentle to myself and others. I see the duality in myself when I read Korean comics and face a story from my team. I would like to analyze this dream as below: I cycled a long way through a mountain and forest. There were some parts where I had to go through flooded areas . At one point, two ferocious dogs tried to bite me, but I was able to pull my leg up to avoid that. Then when I came to a flooded corner, I had to slowly down to wait for a truck that was being filmed by a TV station Thank you Duyen

It's not in my job. They have trouble and I accept to help them but my feelings are not good when I need to go out and meet the state agencies. I am scared that the staff are not ready to do their job and that I should give them more money under the table to solve something. I also feel that it is a waste of time when I need to wait for a staff. During this period, I do mantra Mahashiah to be more patient to remind me why I was there. But my energy goes down and a part of me does not want to do anything. I would like to analyze two dreams as below: 1. I dreamed about a building that had pavements under maintenance in the evening Some children crossed it and got hurt on their legs . One time, a young girl got hurt on her leg and it leaked a lot of blood . A man carried her to the hospital. I went to a classroom where one of my friends was sitting there. We chatted. Another girl came, wanted to turn off the light, and required us to leave. But we rejected her. My friend said that she paid for the course and although the class is online, she had a right to sit here. Thank you Duyen angelic exchanges on the collective level with Mahasiah and anauel

file: Missing; last dream id: D0092; Date of dream: Thursday, April 18, 2024 Angel: 6 Lelahel State of mind: uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Hello Dear Prof Eloi I am working on myself with Angel Lelahel and the question: "Why could I not realize my feelings for other people?" as I shared in my PR I received the dream as below: I was on the bus on the way home and called my parents to pick me up. The bus would come to the drop-off point after crossing the forest . When the bus turned right, it passed an old woman who was standing at the corner. My mother took my father by motorbike because my father was not healthy. My parents came to the point. I also brought my motorbike from HCM city to my hometown so I gave the key to my father. The motorbike had been drained of fuel for safe transportation. A person guided me to buy fuel at a house near there with the phone number having some numbers "...0 59 ...". I suddenly remembered that the motorbike made loud sounds because it was not maintained well. I was scared that my father would find out. My father drove my motorbike and I went home with my mother. To a place, I let my mother go with my father and I went home first. My mother called me that the police officers caught them up and they did not bring the vehicle documents. She didn't know where she was. She only described that the place had a large director armchair and we could use it to relax. I felt angry with her. I also found a way to close the iron door because it was not easy to use. This dream lets me see that the instinctual needs, the difficulties related to authority, justice, receptivity and emissivity are preventing me from evolving in the family relationship and the couple relationship. It is a journey to continue working and rectifying myself. I need to apply the Law of Resonances and other Universal Laws to transform and transcend. It was very real. Suddenly I opened my eyes and realized that the bus had just come to the bus station in my hometown. I needed to pack my luggage and get off the bus. Thank you Duyen

file: A large swimming pool; last dream id: D0093; Date of dream: Sunday, April 21, 2024 Angel: 6 Lelahel State of mind: Afraid Dream and analysis: Hello Dear Prof Eloi I would like to analyze a dream as below: I was studying in the spiritual class EVOLVE I sat at the front desk , and behind me was Linh and An . I moved to the second table, sat next to Linh, and leaned on her. We were studying and I had a problem so I needed to leave first. Ngoc took me back because it was quite a long way. Then when we reached the starting point, he was about to return to the class. Our friends ran to us and said that a big change happened in that area and we needed to leave quickly. He discovered that he left an important item in the classroom, so he returned to take it. I felt it was dangerous, I did not want him to go alone so I went with him. He gave some female friends a few memories that he bought on his business trip. We set out and discovered that ahead were seas of water like rectangular blocks, the depth suitable for swimmers of 1m7 to 1m8. I was a bit scared. He guided me to swim along the side and at that moment I discovered I had a life jacket so I wasn't scared anymore. Coming to the next obstacle, an elementary school was like an underground water tank. I discovered some children were repairing some trees with the mud along the tank's edge. We crossed there. At that time, I took off my shoes. I lost them. I thought I would get them later when I came back. We discovered that two young men were guarding a place on the opposite side of the tank, wanting to prevent water from their place, and using bricks to block water from the tank. Ngoc snuck out to take the bricks. Water started flowing out, and the guards had to deal with it. I was afraid that they would discover us. I was familiar with the roads in this area so I guided him. We went down a staircase and I remembered it belonged to the army, so I led him back up and went into another staircase. I felt the army was looking for us. Then we were in the academic office, we took refuge with a school administrator. The police and some of our friends came to meet him while I hid in the room. I saw him take a male friend in and instructed him to take me there. I read the book carefully under the table and discovered a way to solve it. I can go back to the past before it happened. I did it with the thought of sacrifice. Then I came back the moment before he put the police but he refused to leave. I didn't leave and my aunt , Ms. Thu appeared and dyed my hair another color for me. This dream is long and I am confused to analyze it logically. What should I do in this case? I remember your guide that the beginning of the dream is the main subject of the dream and the other scenes follow the main subject but when I went deeply into the details they made me confused and lost in them. Thank you Duyen

Our friends ran to us and said that a big change happened in that area and we needed to leave quickly. He discovered that he left an important item in the classroom, so he returned to take it. I felt it was dangerous, I did not want him to go alone so I went with him. He gave some female friends a few memories that he bought on his business trip. We set out and discovered that ahead were seas of water like rectangular blocks, the depth suitable for swimmers of 1m7 to 1m8. I was a bit scared. He guided me to swim along the side and at that moment I discovered I had a life jacket so I wasn't scared anymore. Coming to the next obstacle, an elementary school was like an underground water tank. I discovered some children were repairing some trees with the mud along the tank's edge. We crossed there. At that time, I took off my shoes. I lost them. I thought I would get them later when I came back. We discovered that two young men were guarding a place on the opposite side of the tank, wanting to prevent water from their place, and using bricks to block water from the tank. Ngoc snuck out to take the bricks. Water started flowing out, and the guards had to deal with it. I was afraid that they would discover us. I was familiar with the roads in this area so I guided him. We went down a staircase and I remembered it belonged to the army, so I led him back up and went into another staircase. I felt the army was looking for us. Then we were in the academic office, we took refuge with a school administrator. The police and some of our friends came to meet him while I hid in the room. I saw him take a male friend in and instructed him to take me there. I read the book carefully under the table and discovered a way to solve it. I can go back to the past before it happened. I did it with the thought of sacrifice. Then I came back the moment before he put the police but he refused to leave. I didn't leave and my aunt , Ms. Thu appeared and dyed my hair another color for me.",

file: Memories of my adolescence; last dream id: D0094; Date of dream: Monday, April 29, 2024 Angel: 8 Cahetel State of mind: uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Hello Dear Prof Eloi This week I have a 4-day holiday. I was invited to the house of my colleague couple in a province. They were very enthusiastic when they gave me an invitation. But I just made a decision after I did not want to spend my holiday alone in HCM city. In the evening I went to her house after lying on the 8-hour bus. We had dinner and then when we went to bed, she told me her funny stories with her friends when she was studying at the high school. Sometimes, she skipped class and went to play billiards with her classmates. She lets me review my adolescence. It is the beginning of the message I received from the Up Above on that night. And the dream was as below: I was a teenager with my friends (male and female) studying at a high school. We lost in the evening when we rode a bicycle on the road with no one and I guided the way. We went around until we came to one point. We could go to the big road and we do not get lost. When I studied in class 10th . I got depression (I guessed that) because I was negative and silent a lot. I spent most of my time on the Internet playing games and chatting with a friend after school . I lived with two friends, but they were different so I could not communicate I told everything I had with the friend. He listened and gave me advice. After that period, I came back to the goal, studying well as my parents guided me. My emotions continued to be repressed when I did not know how to face them. My parents did not have experience with that. So it creates a distance between me and them. Especially, I was alone as a child when I spent most of my time learning, playing alone, and watching the business of my mother. Thanks for this training, it let me review step by step to cleanse the negative memories. Thank you Duyen angelic transformations of past patterns to advance on the social level in a harmonious way 💫

file: A baby; last dream id: D0095; Date of dream: Thursday, May 9, 2024 Angel: 10 Aladiah State of mind: startle, worried Dream and analysis: Hello Dear Prof Eloi I am so touched after reading your revision. It is so touching and makes me brave on this journey . I have a question for myself that why I need to wait until the last day to apply dreams. I give myself a reason that I need to wait for a special dream. Last night, before going to sleep, I asked myself how I could express my love to another person especially when I read it in the email of UCM. I am not sure what I should do about it. I received a dream as below: I was with my husband - a fat man and my baby who was just born a short time ago in a house which had 2 parts connected by a small road. That evening, my husband and I had a date with Oanh and her husband . Before that, I went back to my room and fell asleep until midnight. I saw a person who was sleeping next to me. At first, this seemed my husband and I hoped for it, but when I looked carefully, this was Oanh . I continued sleeping. Then in the morning, I was started to remember that I still hadn't changed the diaper or fed my baby milk. I began looking for the baby. I saw the child was very small and crawling on the road. His diaper was covered with feces . At first, he didn't let me touch him, I had to apologize a lot and took him to a bath . I washed his back under the water tap. He was cold and trembling. I encouraged him to try and hug me to become better before eating. I suddenly remembered I hadn't started pumping milk for my baby and didn't have milk yet. After that, I held my baby to breastfeeding directly and to stimulate milk production. This dream lets me recall the challenge of taking care of a baby. I become clumsy and hurry to complete it. Thank you Duyen

file: A Shopping Mall; last dream id: D0096; Date of dream: Wednesday, May 15, 2024 Angel: 10 Aladiah State of mind: uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Hello Dear Prof Eloi I would like to analyze my dream as below: I went to a shopping mall . I needed to go to the relative's house through the shopping mall to get something and continue coming to a place, then come back to the shopping mall. I used a special transportation device inside the shopping mall like a spiral rail . I should bind down in a downward direction on the track. With the wrong knowledge, I have blockages related to advancement at the physical and intellectual levels. One of my hands was tied to the side of the device. An old man around my father's age would collect the ticket fee - 90,000 VND , guide the customers, and control the device. With some people per trip, we needed to keep a distance and balance ourselves on the track to avoid falling off. In my turn, at the beginning, I felt a little bit nervous. After that, I forgot something so I and my ex-boyfriend came back to slide again. Only 2 of us but the man still collected the new ticket although I asked for help. Thank you Duyen

file: Difficulty of manifestation; last dream id: D0097; Date of dream: Wednesday, May 22, 2024 Angel: 31 Lecabel State of mind: Uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Hello Dear Prof Eloi Studying Seminar "Lecabel" and Working with Lecabel helped me to be more present and see the business globally. This week I reviewed my job for the coffee business. I ask myself what is the future of the coffee shop. I am confused about how I should operate it. I am researching its mission. What can I do for my teammates to help them be a better version? Next week, I will have a meeting with my teammates. I felt not easy when I was too detached to have immediately its mission, to have the solutions for the business. When its process is not good, some troubles still happen. In the previous, I talked to my teammates to do the better version, improve themselves and the business, and bring better experiences for them and the customer but I saw the lack of manifestation, it is vague and I am too airy. I think I can choose one of the most important points we need to change immediately to focus on at this time. When it works, it will let us see everything in a new way. I would like to analyze this dream as below: I was in a boarding school with my friends. There were two rooms for us. Then my friends and I participated in activities. We applied to an advertising company and the company owner interviewed all of us. After comparing all of us, although there was a conflict between the two teachers, I was chosen. We returned home. Some students took buses, some rode bicycles, and some stayed to wait for the farewell party and then returned. I wanted to go home and invited Hoang to ride his bike together. He agreed. When I packed up, I checked the things under the bed to see if there were still any leftovers. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to load all our luggage because Hoang had 1 suitcase and I had 1 suitcase and 1 backpack . Hoang arranged all of them well. We left at a distance. We pedaled together when going through the slopes. These days, I see my difficulties applying the knowledge to the physical level. I have a fear that I am pushing others or I am letting others too free. What should I fix it? Thank you Duyen

file: A goodbye; last dream id: D0098; Date of dream: Monday, April 18, 2022 Angel: 7 Achaiah State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana, I would like to share a though with you. My boyfriend and I will have a 2-day trip in a cold area with four couples of my friends. Everytime, I mentioned to buy a warm cloth. He replied he didn't need it, he could hug me when he slept. I just thought it was a kidding. Then a couple of my friends joined the trip. There is a long time we do not contact. I feel I don't like it. I would feel alone, lost if I was with them. I see a pattern every time I meet a group, I will be too emissive to get attention. The group is bigger, I feel more difficult. The more they pay attention to me, the more I feel happy. After realizing, I come back to recognize myself and give myself a courage to pass the old pattern. I also understand the meaning of the sentence my boyfriend shared. He is not confident in my groups and I will courage him too. How do you think about it? Here is my dream for this week Three families had an appointment at my grandfather's house Three fathers had a good relationship. They chatted and had some games together. This was the last time for all of them. One of three families only had a father, 2 daughters and a cat . The father would go somewhere, one daughter would buy rice with the mother for donation, one daughter would go somewhere then come back to meet the mother. .. . I was the final person leaving When I had just left in the afternoon, I saw the cat in the room. I push the cat coming out because this room would close too long, the cat would die when it did not have food The cat came out of this room but it did not come out of the house . But I saw a way to get out for the cat so I let it there. It clung to me and didn't want to break up. I met a friend who came and chatted with him a little. Then I came to another part of this house and met my cousin who I really liked.I share the appointment with him and leave. I do not realize the meaning of the final scene. The friend I see is a stranger. He is a man. Is it a part from my unconscious related to my action, a strange action? The cousin is a man too, but I do not remember who he is, I just know I really like him. I come back to my old behavior? Waiting for your sharing Thank you Duyen

I was welcomed and had a lot of fun. Everything was very warm in his family having parents and 4-5 children. I was also introduced to beautiful places to visit. I suddenly saw the phrase "Receptivity Girl" somewhere. At that time, the whole family decided to visit the mountain . I went out to follow and discovered that his family had left. I took the walkie-talkie and phone with me. I remembered that the people had said something regarding transportation before but I didn't pay attention so I got lost. His family rode motorbikes. I could see them later so I didn't call immediately. I walked to a crowded place beside a river and asked for directions. I didn't even remember the name of the mountain. I met a friend who was in a group of 4 people including 1 mother, 1 daughter, and 2 sons, and they knew my lover's family. The friends said some mountains and I heard a familiar mountain's name. I decided to go to that mountain. These days, my energies went down, I was too sensitive, easy to anger, and had negative thoughts. I tend to isolate myself from others . Sometimes, I am not happy when I am alone; I persuade myself it's time I am learning to be alone but it is more surface than the actual change. Thank you Duyen

file: Fear of Unknown; last dream id: D0100; Date of dream: Thursday, June 13, 2024 Angel: 17 Lauviah State of mind: Scared Dream and analysis: Hello Dear Prof Eloi These days I am so down. My head contains many negative thoughts. I am a person who chooses to let my ex-boyfriend come back to my life but most of my time is negative than positive. We have not spent enough time exchanging deeply the most important topics. I do not want to repeat the same pattern as the previous but I could not find a suitable time for our communication. He is too busy with his work and personal activities. He can meet me shortly for dinner. It negatively affects other aspects of my life when I want to improve our relationship but he is unavailable to meet me. What should I do to myself and him? Is it a clear sign for me to stop the complex relationship instead of trying to communicate? Sometimes, I am scared that I do not try to fix it and I only escape from that. I had a fever for 3 consecutive days, felt exhausted, had no vitality, and slept a lot. Then, I started a new menstrual cycle and felt dizzy. That night, when I closed my eyes, I felt scared even though I was sleeping under a light. I saw black objects of unknown shaped all around me. The fear continued to increase, and then I forced myself to open my eyes. When I closed my eyes, there were black objects that I couldn't see clearly, and when I got closer, I was even more scared, my hand became numb. . At that time, I recited the angel Lauviah but felt hopeless and exhausted. I continued to wake up and I would ask the universe to let me sleep tonight, and then after a few, I fell asleep without knowing it. I have difficulty sleeping at night. A lot of negative thoughts have not transformed and they need me to take action through mantra, and meditation instead of ignoring them. My roommate was in a lot of pain during her period, so she told me that if I had pain for a few more days, I would know how she felt. I felt quite shocked by her statement. Thank you Duyen

Sometimes, I need to join a full-day course, it is not easy for me to keep concentration and be conscious all day. What should I need to do in this case? When I am tired, I am easily to be angry with others. What should I understand in this case? I would like to analyze the dream recently I received before joining Love Retreat as below: I joined some activities with some people but I do not know where and when. We moved up and down continuously. At one point, I wanted to vomit. At this time, my physical body also wanted to vomit . I woke up and tried to be calm. These days I learn a lot in the Love Retreat. I also a student in MyEQ teacher program this year. Last night, I asked myself why I had difficulty loving and what love is then I received a dream: I was at MyEQ class with Trang who is a MyEQ teacher. I needed to do something and Nam who is an 8-year student came and wanted to help me He was hyperactive so I was worried and wanted to control him. Once, he and I needed to go somewhere, so he ran and I followed to prevent him from having an accident. We also crossed the road . Then we came back to the class and sometimes, I also hugged him to keep him not moving too much. I wake up with my hard stiff, my nose is a blockage and I need to go to the toilet but I still want to record the dream before going to it. I am more encouraged to step deeply and deeply on the spiritual journey. It is a journey to recode my wrong code in Love. I love to learn and become a better version every day. I hope that I am wiser and wiser after each experience. Thank you Duyen

I tend to hide myself in a bubble. I practice chanting Angel Lecabel and Yana breathing to fix my stuffy nose, usually runny nose and sneezing after sleep these days. It is allergic rhinitis. It is like I do not breathe while I sleep. I understand I should put the right intention into understanding my negative memories are preventing me from breathing smoothly. The blockage at my nose is like the difficulty in transforming and rectifying my negative emotions and thoughts because of my instinct needs. I do not also remember my dream. Besides, I am more careful to manifest. I need to work on myself more than projecting on others and forcing others to do the things I thought. I asked myself how I build my inner couple rightly, how I communicate rightly with my partner, how I give compliments, and how I am at the present moment ... It is a journey and I need to step by step especially doing the right things for me at first. I want to analyze two images last night as below: I saw an image of Da Lat College as a symbol. I am visiting an unconscious part of me. College + Da Lat ( French + Travel ) In Vietnam, we have just entered into a 4-day holiday to celebrate our National Day. While my friends come back home, I choose to stay in HCM city but I still feel a little sad and alone. But I think it is a period when I can spend learning deeply and interiorizing. Then, in another dream, I saw the number: 44.437 ( 44 + 4 + 37 ) like a price Thank you Duyen

I received dreams every night . I asked the Up Above "What is the right thing I should do for my relationship with my ex-boyfriend?" I want to analyze this dream as below: I was on the 6th floor of the office building I wanted to go to the toilet . But I heard Mr. Thang 's phone call asking Mr. An to take the afternoon off because he was in pain. I knew Mr. Thang was in the meeting room so I brought the medicine for him and he was very touched. Then I went to the toilet and saw VTC - one of our services which built our building and now maintenance before the warranty period . They were doing some renovations and removing things in the toilet. I was hungry so I went in and saw a ladder . The person in charge had just come back from somewhere, but when I explained, that person moved to another room. When I got out, I found myself on the 9th floor of the IT company. I didn't have my elevator card to move to my 6th floor, so I needed to go to the reception hall on the 1st floor. It was noon, so there were a lot of employees going down. I lined up and waited for my turn. There were 3 service machines for going down on the left. When it was my turn to go down, I used the first machine, it was delayed because the machine had a problem and was stuck with the command to print company stamps. A woman ran up to take and fix half of it, but she wanted to go to the toilet so she had to leave and then come back. At that time, I realized that they were using a photo machine to go down. Thank you Duyen

I knew Mr. Thang was in the meeting room so I brought the medicine for him and he was very touched. Then I went to the toilet and saw VTC - one of our services which built our building and now maintenance before the warranty period . They were doing some renovations and removing things in the toilet. I was hungry so I went in and saw a ladder . The person in charge had just come back from somewhere, but when I explained, that person moved to another room. When I got out, I found myself on the 9th floor of the IT company. I didn't have my elevator card to move to my 6th floor, so I needed to go to the reception hall on the 1st floor. It was noon, so there were a lot of employees going down. I lined up and waited for my turn. There were 3 service machines for going down on the left. When it was my turn to go down, I used the first machine, it was delayed because the machine had a problem and was stuck with the command to print company stamps. A woman ran up to take and fix half of it, but she wanted to go to the toilet so she had to leave and then come back. At that time, I realized that they were using a photo machine to go down.",

That night, before the deadline for the dream journal, I tended not to do the exercise. There is resistance from me not doing the right thing, I find a superiority love from YouTube. I continue working with my inner couple and the same question: "What should I do for my relationship with my ex-boyfriend?" I want to analyze a dream with some scenes I can remember as below: I needed to go to a place with my mother . I was driving while my mother was walking. I had magical support so I could go faster. I moved on a slope to a high scenic spot in the park and talked with a man for a while. My mother came and reminded me to continue. Because I was too impatient, I hit him who was also riding, and headed down the hole without being able to prevent it in time. I felt like my mother and I had gone very far. I sat with my grandmother and Ngoc during the meal . We were sharing about spiritual beliefs when she brought up the situation of a relative in the hospital, I don't remember her answer clearly because I couldn't listen deeply enough, I tended to show off about the knowledge I had learned, so I shared that I would accompany but still go to work and my grandmother said she would explain later. I found myself trying to get the magic cards of a man having magic to know what would happen. Thank you Duyen

file: My childhood friend; last dream id: D0107; Date of dream: Friday, September 20, 2024 Angel: 35 Chavakhiah State of mind: in doubt Dream and analysis: Hello Dear Prof Eloi This week, when my ex-boyfriend keeps silent with me. Usually, when he is busy at work, he will contact me on messenger. There are a lot of things appearing in my mind. In the beginning, I felt very sad, angry, uncomfortable, and resentful. I do not want to believe it and I want to connect with him. But it is time to work on this memory. I saw it as a dream to work on myself. I continue working on what memories cause the disconnection between me and my inner-masculine polarity. I asked myself why I met this situation. It is not easy to think it is my memories and I need to work on it. My energy went down. I was reminded that I need to do the right thing even in bad situations. Working on myself is a journey and it is okay to deal with it with a nice energy like a lesson I need to learn. So my feeling becomes better. I asked the Up Above to let me know what I should learn from this case. I would like to analyze my dream as below: I saw that I was at home in the countryside (not sure where) then I met Tram , a childhood friend, we talked and took a walk together around the neighborhood. Tram was married and had a son, at that time he was out playing somewhere. Then Tram and I were thinking of meeting up next Friday The human distortions of Angel Lelahel - lack of love preventing healing and understanding. Ambition, On Fridays, I lose discipline, sometimes I am too relaxed and lazy. I recently watched the review film videos until night. It's too late. Because I was still hesitating. Then Tram showed me that her new house required going through a gardendifficulty cultivating one's inner soil, growing beautiful qualities and feelings, materializing one's project. Lack of understanding of the Law of resonance, of the fact that one reaps what one sows like a forest and Tram chased away a dogemotional dependency, emotional overflow, impulsiveness, a compulsive need to be liked, fear of loneliness after it was trying to eat another small animal. Then we decided to go and eat fruit soupdifficulty nourishing myself at the emotional level near a house on the right, while walking, Tram climbed the fenceinability to give oneself an intimate, protected space, to have it respected by others, and to respect it oneself. Violation of other people's space and intimate behavior behind the house to take a shortcut through someone's house but that family was eating inside. I am not respecting others' space and intimate when I have a difficulty at the emotional level. I received a text from him that he didn't call but he wanted to reconnect but he was still hesitant and uncertain. At that time I knew he was waiting for me at home but I hesitated and didn't really believe his message. Thank you The Duyen

file: How to end a relationship well; last dream id: D0108; Date of dream: Wednesday, September 25, 2024 Angel: 72 Mumiah State of mind: uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Hello Dear Prof Eloi I am so sorry for my last dream journal. In the last minutes, I could not save my dream, so I copied, refreshed the portal, and pasted it. I almost forgot to format the styles until 9 am last Saturday and I could not format the styles for all of them. It shows the difficulties in connecting with my inner world and rectifying it in the right way. Besides, at the physical level, my ex-boyfriend said that he did not want me to waste my time with him when he did not have a clear intention for our relationship after I asked him about his silence. He thought that I should spend my time for myself. He trembled and did not face me while he talked with me about that. I would like to understand what memories made us have the difficulties like this. Am I sometimes focusing too much on the matter and forgetting to nourish myself and my relationships? We also have our unconscious should be worked on it with rigor and love. I review my intention in our couple. I see it is related to my instinctive needs, emotional dependencies, getting attention, and selfishness, expectations... It is not an effort to understand my partner and share with him about our life. We lost the common subject or connecting deeply because of just looking at the surface, going outside, and instinctive needs too much. Many times, I asked myself why I needed to enter into a relationship, a family especially when my parents have had many conflicts and it had not been rectified in my memories. I also see the fear that I could not meet a person who is suitable than him; the fear of living alone in my whole life, ... This week, I have a profound seminar. I also practiced Yana breathing a week before the seminar but when I joined the lesson, I slept well. At the physical level, the place where I am living also had a leaky roof. These days it rained. So our hallway became wet. I felt uncomfortable. I asked myself why I put the situation and what was the meaning of it. I received a dream as below: The proof of my room is leaky separating my place for sleeping into 2 parts. I am sleeping on the left. It was very real. I woke up immediately after seeing it. I do not take care of enough myself. I talked to my host about this matter. And I begin finding a new place for my living to have a better life. My place is a room around 12m2 having a glass window to look at the yard but we rarely open the window, it is on the 1st floor, and the house is at the end of a road so it is safe. The price is cheap and the host is friendly. At the minuses, it has some cracks, the leaky roof. It is like a sign to remind me that I need to take care of my inner world, my intimacy I used to think that I would leave the place to be married and live with my husband so I accept the present state of the room. It is like I do not end well so I could not begin a new cycle. After watching the presentation of Prof. Christian Muller in the last seminar and reading your revision, I saw I was trying to connect with the inaccessible love and instinctual needs. It's time to work on myself and do the right thing for me and him. I should end our relationship well by stopping to connect with him, working on his pluses and minuses, following my dreams, and building my inner couple. Thank you The Duyen

I stay up late and sleep a little bit. I am learning a new knowledge of psychology in a three-day seminar. The course is related to the journey of human. Many points from it helps me see the different aspects of my large unconscious. Some parts also mentioned the Law of Resonance. I see the UCM knowledge is very deep and profound. There are six main needs: love/connection, significant, certainty, uncertainty, growth and contribution. They use a model named ENEGRAM to catergorize people with the first feeling: Anger, Shame or Fear when we face a nightmare into 9 groups. Each of them represents for a special character. The purpose is helping people understand themselves, see the pattern and then change themselves better. I see the knowledge helping people coming back to themselves. The more they change, the more the problems will be seen differently. My mind is tired when I have to refer myself intensively. I am more anh more sensitive. What should I do and understand about it? Am I understand It is like a journey to discover different consciousness of me. I would like to analyze a dream as below: I was acupuncture at two opposite parts: the front left and back right with long needles ) The dream shows a difficulty of healing my emotions because of the memories related to actions and blockages in my heart in my relationship. Sometimes my heart is very heavy. Thank you The Duyen

I experienced camping in a higher land with my friends. 12 members separated to 3 camps. We made BBQ with alcohol. We drank too much. One of my friends got tired because of his heart. I felt so worried. He went to sleep. My boyfriend gave me some advice to stop drinking. I cried and said I was strong enough to drink more and asked him why he did not believe me. After that, I shared a part of my feeling from my past to my best friend related to the tired friend. I fell asleep quickly and cannot remember anything from that time. Around 4 am, one of our teams screamed because she had a nightmare - she was betrayed by her husband. Just three people came and helped her. Others were sleeping. In the morning, she remembers her dream. Some friends believed it was caused by a bad ghost living in that area. We should greet when we come to a strange place. I would like to share you my dream as below: I came to a food store which had a large sitting area with 2 men and 1 woman . We were choosing our food. I was watching fish dishes and I chose a fried fish that was too dried and crispy. Others were still choosing and giving me money to make payment. We saw our enemy We ran away. I hid below a table . The enemy is a woman wearing black clothes . She caught me. . I left money on the table to pay for our food. I was released and returned to the base. I talked with my boss then I came back to my place. ...I met my boyfriend and he hugged me and said we were alone. Thank you Duyen

I ran after that to meet the deadline. After the course I shared, I realized that I am trying to help others and if I do not receive recognition from others I can be angry and ignore others. Sometimes, I do not understand why we can categorize some types of people when we have accumulated a lot of memories from many lives. I would like to analyze two dreams as below 1. I have a competition through taking care of overgrown trees . My task will be pruning each leaf from the outer. 2. I was required to join a long journey through the needed areas I have just realized that when I receive a dream, I need to realize the pattern and then I need to find out the memories related to it to rewrite the code for it. Am I right about this? Thank you The Duyen

I would like analyze a dream I received this week as below: Trang and I were at the airport to fly to the US to study something. The check-in process having two parts was fine, even though we only lost a little bit from the first to the second area. The second area is a separate deserted area. The second time, Trinh, Trang, and I flew. Trang and I had an appointment to do the check-in process together. Even though we had gone the second time we were still in the wrong place. But I suddenly realized that I forgot to bring my passport . Because I moved all my needed stuff from my backpack to my suitcase to put my backpack at home except for my passport. It was around 6 am and the flight was around 8 am . My house was not too far from the airport. At first, I thought about going home to get it myself, I didn't want my parents to rummage through my backpack and see something bad. But I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to finish the procedure in time. I called my dad and he told me that he would tell my older brother to help me. There is a disconnection between me and my origin of actions, I do not receive enough help in this case. After my call, I wanted to tell Trang my problem but she seemed angry, ignored me, and went with Trinh. I also asked my dad if it wasn't possible, to let me book a grab. I was sitting and waiting for my dad's answer on the chair outside the area when a strange man approached me and joked with me a bit. Thank you Duyen

What should I do if I know a fault of a person to me, I know it is a law of resonance but every time seeing that person, my memories will come and my old feelings will appear. Sometimes, I am so harsh with my roommate, sometimes, I kept a distance with her and not nice with her when she shares or asks me. She is still positive and helpful to me when I asked her. Last night, when I came back from a party. I and she had a conversation about what I should do to get over my breaking up. She reminds me to love myself, recognize my effort and no need to feel guilty. It is a long time we talked together a deep subject. She is more patient, more knowledgeable than I ever knew. I felt at ease after the conversation. I am so touched when I see her different. These days, I organize myself better than ever. I observed my feelings and pay attention to work on myself This week I would like to analyze the dreams: I dreamed of the family of Prof Anthony. They wanted me to help take a photo of them. I met many difficulties and felt confused, sometimes, I could not open the app or many people crossed us. In another dream, Truc I went collecting a debt at Dong Quang company . We needed to take a long walk to the company. We waited at the gate and met some people including Nhan . One time, Truc sneaked in with a group of 2-3 people but the problem could not be solved.

I am lighter than before. It is a practice I do for myself. Thank you so much. I am so touched and have more hope and love. I had an intense conversation with my manager about insurance for our company. My company is an office rental company. We need to deal with our office tenant to buy insurance for their assets and their public liability to third parties. In the beginning, I contacted a person from an insurance company to ask some questions and understand some points. After that, I discussed it with my manager. Then we talk more deeply about the risks that may happen. When he talked more and more, I felt tired. The more we discussed, the more our conservation became very angry. I was more rebellious and did not want to go deeply into the problem anymore. I feel disturbed, I am tired. When we stopped our conversation, two of us were very angry. We kept silent after that. I also thought I was not wrong to say sorry immediately after finishing it. The atmosphere was too heavy. I took time and calmed down. I sent him a message to say sorry to him for my attitude. That evening, I felt so tired and I cried a lot. It was very heavy for me and I couldn't handle it. My manager replied and gave me some hints to understand the case of that including the way he presented the matter to me. I thought it was right. But under the Law of Resonance, it was more than that the conversation triggered my memories of the past when I had many conversations with my brother . I was in a survival mode to protect myself. I used to avoid it. I lost the global vision of our conversation. We were discussing to see the risks for our company more clearly, find suitable solutions. Sometimes, I lack respect for my manager when he says too much. I would like to analyze a dream below I was in a class . In the beginning, I designed something on Canva. Then we did some physical activities related to flexibility with a female teacher. The class was crowded and we had some difficulties moving, especially on the right side. Then, I was in another class. The class monitor should hand the test result out to the class. But he did a half and gave a half to me without saying anything. I did it and I could not know the name of my class to give the right test result to the right person. So I did a little that I knew and then I read out loud the name on the test result to find. I remember in my class, I met Ngan . Thank you Duyen

But Linh and I didn't sit together. The classroom was long and horizontal. There was An Nguyen . The class was chaotic so most students moved their positions, but I was still sitting in the middle, at the back of the class, against the wall next to a girl. Then my friend came and wanted to sit with me but the girl was uncomfortable so my friend sat at the front of my table. After that, someone asked Linh's position, I had to shout to find her. She was at the left corner of the class from the entrance. Then I looked at the camera screen on the right wall and saw Linh Phan smiling sadly with 2 drunk men , one of them was trying to talk and answer but collapsed on the chair. Then in a dark place in the school, Linh Phan went with a man because he asked to go somewhere by car. It was dark and had trees on both sides like in the forest. He raped her. They struggled and in the end, he fell on the road and died. These days, I have the training to do the right things in a large workload. I needed to move from the old office on the 6th floor to my new office on the 5th floor. My team also needed to decorate the Christmas tree for our building in a short time. I felt so tired and today, I had an accident when my manager slipped on the ladder because the ladder was not stable so my face got hurt. I got a bruise near my eye on the right side of my face. Thank you Duyen

file: Money under the table; last dream id: D0118; Date of dream: Friday, November 15, 2024 Angel: 4 Elemiah State of mind: Uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Hello Dear Prof Eloi I would like to share a story about how I felt uncomfortable. My feelings went down too much because it touched my core and triggered many of my memories. Today, I met a male tax official related to a tax that was applied in 2015 and there was a mistake in the tax code. In the beginning, I did a paper to meet the required laws but it did not work. So the tax official required me to give a little money to another female tax official to solve the problem. I had a hesitation to do it then I did it. After that, I felt angry and tired. I asked myself why I needed to do it. I thought that I was doing the wrong thing and helped it continue in the wrong way. At noon, I had a conversation with my manager about this story. He told me that it was a normal rule when I worked with the government, I needed to accept it because it is a part of our life. It is like an exchange and sometimes, I need to do it to complete my work. I remember when I graduated from a university in the Logistics field. I denied a part of my career related to customs. I understood the responsibilities of customs but I felt disgusted with "money under the table" to have a smooth process. It is an important subject I need to face. Through the Law of Resonance, I am visiting the part of myself where I am too materialistic, I did not complete my responsibility and would like to get something from others. Besides, I am judging others and could not accept the part irritation in myself and others. Sometimes, it helps us learn how to accept evil. I would like to analyze a dream I had: I was in a class with many older people . I needed to talk to them about spirituality and had them study it. These days, I am more careful with myself. When I hear something from a person, I ask myself if I judge him or not. It was not right to do but my mind somehow still did it. I need more time to understand myself and others in cases with the Law of Resonance then the judge will leave. I also want to know how you organize and complete the work efficiently. I see my mind has a lot of stress when I receive many tasks with urgent deadlines under many roles. But the workload and the way I thought made me exhausted and delayed. I have not found the balance between my work and my life. Sometimes, I think I need to relax, to be lazy without doing anything. Thank you Duyen

file: Be nice to myself; last dream id: D0119; Date of dream: Friday, November 22, 2024 Angel: 5 Mahasiah Dream and analysis: Hello Dear Prof Eloi This is the final dream for my 3-year journey. I was so touched when I got the DSSI certificate, which marked an important step in my spiritual journey. The right codes are like seeds in a garden nourished in my life. My life has gone up and down and up and down many times, I studied step by step to stabilize my life. It is an effort to discover myself and reconnect with the Up Above. Sometimes, I have a vague thought that I cannot accept my negative aspects. I tend to repress them when they go up by the right things like a robot. Yesterday, a DSSI student shared her stories about working with the negative parts of her life, I discovered that the way I do this is by repressing myself. She told me that I could spend more time talking, understanding, and educating it correctly. I realize that apart from it is not wrong, it also has its pluses. I can experience before jumping to the results right or wrong immediately. I realized that this week, I almost stayed up too late to watch an anime series . It is a little bit different that I read some books, meditate and do the mantra, and then watch one anime episode. While I watched it, sometimes, my mind analyzed it under plus and minus codes. But it is not right when I do not sleep enough and I cannot remember my dreams well. I resist when I do a wrong thing covered by some right things and just one wrong thing. I see myself too strictly when I just want to do the things that seem positive and reject the things that seem negative or useless. I may enjoy it like a hobby but adjust the watching time earlier. I also have a fear that I am addicted to reading light novels, manga, or watching anime. Because there are so many kinds of them. Sometimes, I doubt why I do not stay up late to watch the DSSI videos but I can do like that with manga or anime. Because the DSSI videos are very profound and good for me. I am rebellious to face the prohibited things. The negative forces are stronger than I know. How do I improve my intention? I sometimes do not pay attention to my intentions. Usually I do it as a habit. I need to give myself more time to understand myself. I would like to analyze a dream in which I cut myself at the right palm with a shape like a mountain . (The dream reminds me the way I am doing is hurting myself and losing vital enery. ) Thank you so much for revising, guiding, and supporting me with a lot of love, wisdom, and compassion ... I was inspired to continue to go on this journey with more care for my unconscious. Now I feel a little bit so fast when I study DSSI. Everything is changing in many ways in my life. I registered for the TD certificate. Could you give me some advice? Sometimes, I feel unconfident about myself when I may not study as hard as I expected over the years :) :) :). Duyen

file: A Bird and A Tiger; last dream id: D0120; Date of dream: Saturday, February 8, 2025 Angel: 21 Nelkhael State of mind: uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle, This year, I am learning the way to manifest when I realize that it is so easy to live in a bubble. I also gave myself the idea that I had a great job, it helped me have more time to learn DSSI through three years. I am asking the Up Above the way I need to manifest for a new job because I am not working in the field that I want to work deeply and longly. I am taking action: fixing my CV, finding a new job on the online platform, learning English, preparing for interviews, committing to doing more to my plan ... but sometimes I see doubt about my ability. I have an inferiority complex when I am not confident in myself. I also see that "I'm not good enough" and I need to learn as much as possible. I delay taking action and finding more courses to learn. When I worked with the Angel Nelkhael, I received a dream as below: instinctual forces and needs that generate and influence our capacity and way of thinking I gathered with some people in a room of a place like a coffee store There was a bird and a tiger cub I tried to get attention from the bird by looking at it. At one moment, the bird came to me so, I hugged it with my left hand to protect it because it cannot fly. Then, the tiger cub came to me. The cub belonged to a woman but he followed me so I hugged it with my right hand and I thought I would turn it back to the owner tomorrow. It was time to leave. When I nearly left the place with two animals, on my left hand, the bird transferred to the skeletons put in the bag. I couldn't believe that so I went to the camera room for a check. But it was over 18:15 so no one was in the room. I saw a male guard who was sitting not far away. I told him about the bird. I realized that the cub also disappeared. I see a little bit of my qualities in the dream that I take responsibility for taking care of the two animals. I asked myself when I have the above pattern in my life. There is a wrong intention at the beginning when I am with others. I should be present and nourish the relationships by understanding myself and others instead of focusing on my needs. When something is lost, I need to keep a global vision not to dramatize or trivialize. Besides, I expect people in the outer world too much. I can ask for help but no expectation. I should take care of myself and do the best I can. When I did this dream journal, I realized I did not want to go to sleep when I could not interpret this dream smoothly. I kept me awake until 3 am but I did not work instead I watched entertainment videos and ate something. There was a feeling that I needed to complete but another of me rejected doing the right things. I have not found the right way. I think a solution is that I go to sleep and wake up earlier to do the dream journal. Besides, I can give myself a little time to watch videos when I have free time. It is to help me not repress myself and still do the right things. Is it mechanical? Thank you Duyen Reviewer's Message: A beautiful hello Ân, Thank you for your feedback on her practical work :) I would like to see with you for her job search, perhaps you have already given her some advice? Also I was wondering if it was the right grade for her? Angelic thoughts, Danièle 🙏🌸

file: Leaving; last dream id: D0121; Date of dream: Wednesday, March 5, 2025 Angel: 51 Hahasiah State of mind: Uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Danièle, These days, my mind is so intense, that after a busy week of learning seminars, I am too relaxed. I would like to analyze the dream as below: "I heard that Nhi said to me that she will leave at the coffee store and she would do another job in a food store regarding issue ... who contacted me recently." These dreams show that I have difficulty nourishing my inner world at a social level. I also have a fear that Nhi could leave the store because she is very good member. I even understand that I need to bring more benefits for her and help her develop herself. I think the positive point is that I find a solution by connecting the new employees instead of depending on the other members I think about the commitment to working. How do I have the right fidelity? I appreciate my work where I do the best and I give effort but it is not related to the field I would like to do for the long term. I do not understand why I sometimes like something and dislike something. I would like to work in producing the products more than giving the services related to communication. I have a tendency to avoid communicating because I do not pay attention to others and sometimes, it has more facade than I can imagine even when I have studied this course related to conscience. That day, my mind was so complicated. I manage a coffee store with 5 members. This week, one full- time staff, Nhi has some days off. The day before I received the dream, Vy one of them registered to work with the store in the morning. I was happy because that day, the coffee store only had one member, Nguyen , had registered and I had to come early to support him. On that day, I came to my work at the normal time and realized that only Nguyen was working and I felt angry with Vy. Her period should begin at 6:30 am. I saw her send me a message for coming late around 1 hour later without a clear explanation at 7:00 am, I felt she was irresponsible. I supported Nguyen and I asked myself why I was so annoyed. What should I do? I realized that I did not believe her when she changed her schedule and was late for work. I decided to ask her the reason instead of guessing and I only focused on supporting my team. Then my anger disappeared. Besides, after trying learning and working at the store, a new member rejected continuing the next day. I do not understand its meaning. Besides, I also asked myself what I should do for my team. Because I feel it is not easy to have a good vision for the store. The business is a part of my work but I have rejected it for a long time because I do not know too much related to it. It is apart that I felt uncomfortable when I did not know how I could develop it in the future. What standard do I can give to the coffee store? How do I take care of it? It cannot depend on any member. It should create a good environment and bring value to the customer. How do I develop it? Focusing on the customer experience? Because I do not want to attach myself for too long I do it temporarily. My major is related to International Business. I would like to go back to supply chain management. It is more related to my major than my present job. It makes me dizzied when I cannot advance rightly. I even reminded myself that I needed to develop my qualities. What should I do in this case? I do not know in my case. I should create the vision for the coffee store and do the related things to get the goal. Of course, it should be a long-term goal including the revenue target and the qualities related to customer service. It is not clear enough but I can research and do the best for it not only the customers but also the employees of the coffee store. Sometimes, I ask myself what I can do for our team, and what training I could bring for them. Thank you Duyen

file: A difficulty seeing global vision; last dream id: D0122; Date of dream: Thursday, March 20, 2025 Angel: 28 Seheiah State of mind: Uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle, I would like to analyze this dream as below: I was a base with the data processing mission on a mountain. I saw some people walking precariously across a bridge connecting two points without railings only allowing one direction to pass , some people fell Then a woman, introduced me to a type of animal connecting with the vital energy without discernment and using it to advance that the group used for support. I looked for a while, and when I prepared to leave, I couldn't see her as if she was attacked, but with GPS , I found her and supported her. In the base, the children who were only 6 or 7 years old had to take care of each other. The first dream invites me to reconsider my intentions carefully to adjust them. Sometimes, I need to be careful about my experience, it can create a blockage in the way I evaluate a matter and create a wrong reaction. I woke up, wrote down the dream, and came back to sleep then I received another dream: My aunt, Thuan visited my house where my parents , I, and 3 children were. She asked about my university entrance exam scores and advised me to quit my long-time English class but didn't say it directly. She also compared the scores with another one like her child. Then the 3 children and I formed a formation to dance . One of them in the front was wearing a jacket because he wanted to charge his phone in its pocket. So I told him to put his jacket down and take it back after he finished dancing. Thank you Duyen charge his phone -
