Thank you for guiding me on this journey. I worked with the angel Caliel with the important question: "Is my boyfriend a husband fit for my developing quality" (I have asked it for two months) Here is my first dream: My boyfriend and I came back to his home - not his present house. His family had dinner but we have not eaten . I prepared the meal for both of us. His younger sister showed me the place to take the food. The preparation was nearly completed with a lack of fish sauce so he was taking it. I went down to the ground floor while he was on the high floor . Then he finished making fish sauce, I went up without his call. When I am on the highest floor, he and my old girlfriend swinged down by rope and he dropped the friend off. He intended to ask me to marry but I was at the beginning position and I was looking down. The second dream: "I was attacked by a white strong light from both sides when I ran after a friend I could not open my eyes . I did Tai Chi weakly before I fainted." I am too strict on myself, it prevents me from receiving the reality related to 2 polarities. The third dream: " My friend, Y and I discovered a white strange paint stain falling down from the roof when my paternal family gathered to celebrate flew down to find us but we escaped so it flew away. A next scene, a white paint stain from the roof fell down on some children , they just dissolved, a big creature attacked, luckily a man hit the creature and it disappeared. A next scent, when the family gathered in the attic , my mother and I saw a paint stain, and I announced dissolving immediately. Everyone except I and Y ran to the door . We hid to the back, jumped to other roofs to hide and find the signal of the creature. Some of the adults also found it when he was preparing to attack but it ran away in our way. I was protected by my cousin when I was on the roof. Then, I was on the way back home . I have just been on a bridge then a big water flowed and brought a big shark . I held the bridge and pretended to die and escaped. When I was at home, I decided to pick my lover up to my house to have dinner. His home is in a military area . It used to be a school where I spent my time when I was a child. I guaranteed to protect him and I believed I can do it. When I crossed the military school, it was a big wind but I still took him to his home." Third dream is "I was in a class and prepared for an examination . A woman teacher guided me using a cow replace a pig for the examination ." Fourth dream is " a registration of marriage " There are some memories let me leave off the spiritual way. Fifth dream is "I, Oanh Quang , Nguyen and some friends gathered at a place on a floor to chat and then moved to a party . We needed to walk to the party. The street was like a street coming to . There were. many groups dressed in different clothes . I was suddenly called from a group. The group is 3 girls wearing hoodies . I was invited to dance together with them on the platform. Then I moved to another place. All my friends disappeared . I knew they were coming back in the first place, I was waiting for them in anger. After a long time, they rode across me to leave." Thank you very much.

My company has a big change in the next time. My boss confirmed to sell our company. I can continue working at the present position.

I work hard such as completing my tasks, supporting my teammate, receiving some new tasks ...I see two opinions appearing: "feeling happy to have more work" and another "feeling tired because of too much" in my company. A percentage of myself does not like to do too much But I understand it lasts a short period. Besides, I hope that I can have more work to do in the future. In my department, this time, there is a member who has to handle more work than us. We offer to help her but she refuses because it takes more time to guide us than do by herself She mentioned many times she was too busy because of too much work. I have a feeling I want to have more work to do this time to balance among our department . In the afternoon today, I have a small meeting with my manager. He guides me to do a sales report for the future and he also has a wish to promote me to Deputy Manager. He gives me pluses: "eager to learn, manage data, work hard, be careful" and minus "communication". He gives me some ways to improve that soft communication, Taking care of others,... I am good at an independent job but I am not sure what I can do for other members if I have a higher position. What can I do in this case? I would like to share a dream as below: An owner - a man allowed me to invest money a long time to his forest I saw some trees be cut down The cut spots were smeared with substance . I asked him about that. He said those trees cannot grow again. Thank you very much Duyen

file: A complex thought; last dream id: D0011; Date of dream: Friday, August 19, 2022 Angel: 2 Jeliel State of mind: Afraid Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana This week, I am working with Angel Jeliel and Angle Haziel. I have asked "Is my boyfriend a suitable husband for my program?". I received some dreams and I just remembered some images from them. I would like to share with you the following: - I forgot to wear a bra when I went somewhere. When I found that , I quickly tried to find something to cover. - I am standing on a small object floating on a large water Last week, my boyfriend and I went to a wedding of my best friends. Two of my best girl friends asked my boyfriend about the time we will marry. I heard from them one of the reason is that my boyfriend is following many goals in his life but I never heard from him or asked him about it. Is there a point I need to improve? Out of the confirmation from the Universe, what do I need to do for my couple, for my boyfriend and for myself? I don't understand him enough. I am not sure I take care of him enough. I also have a thought many times to reject our relationship. Sometimes, I want to be married, sometimes I don't want it. Why do I need to be married? Sister Vandana, what is the right thing? What should I do? Nearly a long vacation, I do not want to come home or my boyfriend's home, because I will hear the question: "When do we have a wedding? Why do we not make the final decision?" Additionally, I would like to share another story with you. I will leave the present company at the end of this month. My previous manager offered me a job related to accounting and sales admin in a building for lease. I have not had experience in accounting but I accept to be trained. My boss is good and the environment is good. My experience does not relate to it but I would like to do it. I will have a chance to organize, arrange documents, service customers ... Besides, I have studied sql to explore data analytics. It is the beginning of a journey. I see it is not easy at this age. But I still want to enjoy it. I feel happy when I solve a problem. I do not know how far I can go but I still continue to discover it. My friend asked me where I want to gain in the long term but I do not have an answer. Is that right? Thank you very much, Duyen

file: Marriage; last dream id: D0013; Date of dream: Friday, August 26, 2022 Angel: 18 Caliel State of mind: Surprise, neutral Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana, I would like to share with you the next story related to my couple's relationship. My boyfriend had told me that he had made a decision for our relationship but he needed more time to inform me officially. Last weekend, I shared my feelings and thoughts with my boyfriend. I asked him his emotions and opinions realted to marriage. I talked a lot about my negative thoughts, bad feelings, pressures, some intentions in marriage and raising a child... He listened to my sharing. I reasked his opinion. He required me to ask him yes-no questions instead of what, how, why questions Then, I asked him if we were married? If we will get married in September as per Lunar calendar?. He said yes and he let me know that his house in his hometown is being fixed. His family will come to my home early. I am a little happy but a big worry because I have not received the answer from Up Above for our relationship. Observing myself and receiving some advice from a DSSI friend, I realized I gave myself many reasons to avoid marriage - My wrong intention is perfection so I do not accept mistakes, learn from them. The friend reminded me of my intention on a new journey. I do not follow to be a better person. I let the outside things, the memories, the future affect me a lot and I focus on the negative too much. Although, I discussed becoming a better person to my boyfriend in the past. Mantra is one of the ways to help me remember my final intention, rectify my memories and it is a process to be a better person. - I use the sentence: "My parents do not teach me about this topic" to avoid taking responsibility. I have a right to improve myself in it. - I need to communicate properly with my boyfriend. It is a lesson. I usually keep silent on the subjects related to marriage, babies, the things I love, the things I hate, money ... with him because I am not confident to show myself. - I did not improve myself to be a better person every day. I just asked the Up Above and hope they will give me the final answer. This situation helps me to face the truth, the problems I need to rectify instead of delay. Last night, I had two dreams like the one below: First dream: I dreamed of a case from the Harry Potter series. There was a man who tried to save a person but his younger sister died . Second dream: It happened in my home. There was an elderly man who could not talk . He chose a kind of medicine in a wardrobe . I took 3 perfect pills and 1 urgly pill . I asked him to take the urgly pill first to delete it. Thank you very much, Duyen

file: Lost; last dream id: D0015; Date of dream: Wednesday, August 31, 2022 Angel: 18 Caliel State of mind: Tired Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana, This week, I continue working on the intention related to my boyfriend. One night, after our date , when I crossed an old woman who was riding a bike at a turn , my motorbike fell because it hit a stone . I just injured my knee a little. I also received a dream as below: My friends and I had a party . After I got drunk , I had a short sleep I came back to the party and sat with my female friends in the middle of the table while the male friends sat at two sides of the table. My attitude was not friendly at that time I ate some dishes on the table. Then I saw myself at a large land. I went to a big road by bicycle and chose a direction. Firstly, I turned right on my intuition. There was something incorrect I checked the google map and discovered I should turn left . So I turned left and I saw a woman with two barriers and two spaces between them. She would like to collect a fee But I ignored her and continued my direction . I passed by a pagoda where it had a billboard selling a thing in porcelain. I guessed it should be broken to define a real porcelain thing. I have had a 4-day holiday at my boyfriend's hometown. My boyfriend spent his time at some parties with his friends. He got drunk. After a party, he came home and found me. I saw my attitude was the same as my mother's when my father came home after a party. The attitude is an uncomfortable feeling and a little angry. I used to hate this attitude from my mother and also wished I would not repeat it. Thank you very much Duyen

Anthony and Vandana, The first DJ is a reminder for me on this spiritual way. Thank you for your guiding and sharing . I would like to share my dream interpretation this week. My mother and I came to check-in at a luxury beautiful hotel . Firstly, we were in line with a crowd attending an event of Pros. Kaya and Pros. Christian to take hotel slippers Everyone I met were easily angry . I saw two pairs of pink slippers in the basket; I took one slipper and another from a person. I suddenly recognized and apologized him but he was so angry to accept . He took a slipper without retaking. Some girls were noisy so I lost my attention. I needed to take a paper for check-in. My mother and I went along the corridor to our room, we could see all beds in all rooms there. Their walls were like a door to go through. A woman staff stood in the middle of the corridor to test and she asked me. I answered rightly so she let my mother and I go through. Two old friends helped us bring our luggage to our room I said something made my mother angry. She moved to the hotel lobby. The friends and I asked the reason but she kept silent and found something until my aunt appeared. She was angry and left. I am practicing to recognize myself three positive things and one improved thing every day. It is not easy for me. It also makes me less hard to others, now I still rarely appreciate or give compliment to other people who do the good things. It is a journey and I continue to do it. Wish you have a nice day!!!
