C0008,D0001,02/04/2025,"I saw vegetable rows in a house , and I want to water them. There were Vy and Sao . I pulled the hose to water them, and had to go around in all sorts of ways. I also met a female water seller in front of the house, who didn't want me to pull the hose through her position because she felt it was quite annoying. She still let me pass. Everyone told me to water them too much . The seller accidentally had an unexpected event at home and needed money. , so she asked Sao if he could pay back some of the money he owed. He went in and took out some of the water bottles to pay. That morning, before going to work, I dropped a small bottle of perfume on the ground. The bottle did not break, but a little spilled out. I did not realize that the perfume had spilled into the box of vegetables I cooked to bring to the company to eat. When I analyzed my dream, I asked myself how emotions (""water"") can nourish emotions (""vegetables""). I did not realize that point consciously and it's time to work on that. It shows that I think too much more than I feel. Emotions are something that I have, but I didn't know how to nourish them. That is the reason why I am at the intellectual level more than at the emotional level. Sometimes, I just find a way to adjust my thoughts and then adjust my feelings. I also see that I do not notice my feelings enough, but I can discern my thoughts when it has a problem. This is one of the reasons making me have difficulty analyzing this dream. I asked myself: ""How am I nourishing my emotions? Are emotions important to me?"" There were some confusions in me for this topic. I realize that I am trying to go deeply into a topic instead of ignoring that. Thank you Duyen",Neutral,From PDF: Vegetable Rows in a House
C0009,D0001,12/04/2025,"I sat down with Ai somewhere. I needed to contact Bang Tuyen urgently in my hometown, because I was careless and gave the wrong information to Tuyen. When Ai knew my fault, she was very angry and required me to fix it immediately. She even started calling and gave the phone to me. But on the other side, some people were joking, so they did not reply . I was uncomfortable, and I asked her to turn off the call, and I would call again later. The previous morning, Ai was a person who asked me whether my relationship with my ex-boyfriend continued or not. Because she and another female friend wanted to kick him out of my friends' chat group that we had been added to. I said he and I stopped, and she could do what she wanted. I asked myself if it was right. He came to my friends' group, but he can be our friend even though he and I broke up.

C0010,D0001,01/05/2025,"I was sitting in a restaurant . There were two friends sitting in front of us and turning around to talk to us and two male friends sitting to my left. While we were there, I overheard something about an upcoming birthday but I wasn't sure whose it was. I also listened to some bad news but I couldn't remember. Eventually, a birthday cake appeared, and we all celebrated— it turned out to be for the male friend beside me, whose nickname was "" Mouse "". Another male friend joined in, pretending it was his birthday too, making everyone laugh. The atmosphere was joyful, and the male friend next to me—who felt like my boyfriend —was gentle and kind and I felt a warm connection between us. Later, the other male friend mentioned that he liked cheerful work, like the kind I do, and asked me to let him know if I heard of any similar job opportunities. That day, I met with some friends who are now very busy with their children. Even though they came to a gathering, they couldn't spend much time with the group. One of my friends called me by an ugly name many times, this time, I stood up for myself and told him not to speak to me that way, but he continued, and it exhausted me. During a short conversation, he asked what I had learned from DSSI and how I could prove my level. I felt uncomfortable. I didn't feel it was the right time or place to explain what I had learned, especially since he seemed focused only on concrete results. I refused to go into detail and kept evolving his questions, though apart from me feared that might damage our friendship. Finally, one of my friends wanted to share something she was passionate about and asked me to listen. But I started to sense that some of what she shared didn't feel right to me—it seemed to deny something negative or even harmful. I felt conflicted. I didn't think she would accept my perspective. I'm still unsure what the right thing is—for me or for her. I know she means well and wants to help, but I also know I need to be true to what I've learned and believe. Additionally, I hurt my right thumb twice recently, which reminded me how easy it is to judge others without seeing the full picture. Maybe what we see as someone's mistake is actually tied to a deeper story—or even karma from past lives. This helped me remember not to judge others. Coming home and observing the way my parents live I understand that there are some renunciations I should do deeply on myself and change myself, not changing others.",Comfortable,From PDF: Nourishing a Right Love

C0014,D0004,15/05/2025,"Phap and another friend cycled past where I lived. I've also felt more connected to the love I receive in my life. For example, when some colleagues made mistakes, I initially felt frustrated and thought they should have been more careful. But instead of reacting, I stayed calm and shared my point of view gently. I've become more aware that I'm working with human beings, not robots, and that awareness makes me feel more connected to them. My mother recently reminded me that while I can be a vegetarian, I should consider eating what others eat in social situations, so I can be more easily accepted. At first, I might have resisted this advice, but now I understand it came from a place of love and concern. She's worried about me, and I no longer feel the need to argue like I used to. Instead, I appreciate her perspective and even encourage her to take care of her own health, especially since she was unhappy at the time. I respect the rhythm of my family and the wisdom it brings. I feel happy and softer than before. Of course, I'm still working on my insecurities — especially the desire for love and attention from others — but I'm starting to see that everything I seek already exists within me. And I'm learning to recognize and trust that more each day. THANK YOU Duyen",Uncomfortable,From PDF: 
C0015,D0001,30/05/2025,"The large campus featured a study area and a residential zone, divided by a stream. I ARRIVED early, hoping to rent a temporary room for a nap However, upon entering the right building , I found every room occupied. I spoke with the female manager , alongside two other girls, also seeking accommodation. She informed me that rooms were only rented monthly and that this was the male section. She then led the two girls to the female area across the way. I sensed her discomfort with my presence, but thankfully, one of the girls pulled me along. On the other side, the other male manager said something like There were no rooms available. I saw Ngan there, though she seemed unfamiliar. Then I left. I stopped by the food court and ran into several old friends, both male and female, whom I hadn't seen in a while. They were enjoying themselves at the counter, picking out food, chatting before heading off. I was in another scene, like in a class, and there was a reaction related to lightning .","I felt paralyzed when I realized I only had a week to submit my exercises. While I made progress this month—preparing the PR early, the Source Code in the middle, and the Angelica Yantra at the beginning—leaving me with less work, I was still exhausted this week. To counter this, I dedicated one evening to meditation and relaxation, simply lying down without doing anything. I understand this exhaustion is an accumulation of memories, and I am learning to transform them.",From PDF: Restructure
C0016,D0002,30/05/2025,"I recently had a dream where I was driving my ex-boyfriend to his company, making a right turn. It felt like a stark reminder that I'm repeating old patterns. I spoke to him that he should be the one driving me. This dream makes me think about how recently I am trying to make myself in work, I have a fear that if I do not do anything, I will be like a die, I will go down, I will not develop. So even when I want to watch something, I use the English video to help me learn it and become familiar with it. I think I can give myself a little time for breaking to breathe and doing the mantra. Relaxing in the right way is a good thing for my evolution. When I think about the symbol of my boyfriend in my dream, I realize that he is a part of me and he spends most of his time working. Even when his work is over, he can cut all of his time to just work and some basic activities for a long time. He just spent a little time on our relationship after he arranged for his sport, his party with his colleagues. I accept that he needs to relax when he works a lot like that. But his balance is not easy, even though he rarely calls his family. He thinks that he should earn money for the future of my parents, but when he comes back to his home with his family, he spends most of the time gathering and drinking beer. His mother told me that he did not share anything."" This dream resonated with something I learned from a video about a book, which described a teacher asking four-year-old students if they wanted to repeat the same lesson or try something new. A portion of them chose the familiar option, and I realized I have a similar tendency to stick with what's comfortable, indicating a difficulty in embracing new challenges to learn step by step.","This week, I achieved significant efficiency by restructuring my coffee business. A team member suggested a better salary, prompting me to reconsider. After discussions with my boss and manager, I implemented a new KPI and Revenue structure for my coffee team, offering increased bonuses for goal achievement. Other new structures were also introduced. While not exactly what she expected, it confirmed I had listened to her concerns. I reflected on why this weighed so heavily on me, realizing my appreciation for her efforts in the store. However, I recognized a need to improve how I manifest my intentions. I must commit to following my structure, including random task evaluations, which will offer a new perspective to the team. I need to act more as a manager and less as just a guide. I accept who I am and will do my best. I also found myself frustrated with a supplier who repeatedly made the same mistake. Attempts to explain were met with refusal, leading to monthly errors. I realized my energy is stronger now, and I questioned whether I could change her or if a different approach would yield better results. I need to use the right energy to communicate with her.",From PDF: Restructure
C0017,D0001,07/06/2025,"My friends came over to my place, including Dieu and her second son , who could already talk, plus two or three other friends . We were doing something when her son wanted to leave . I went to the convenience store to buy something. Then I called a ride for her and her son. When the car arrived, she and her sat in the back with a large car seat . They sat next to another passenger. The car dropped that person off first, then her and her son. After I got back and we continued hanging out, I suddenly remembered I had a meeting at 2 PM that I'd completely forgotten about. A friend even messaged me asking why I wasn't online. I thought to myself, if I'd remembered, I wouldn't have been goofing around like this. Then I noticed the bedroom had a display box on the wall filled with butterflies and other winged insects I'd forgotten to clean it out. Before I could even touch it, they all flew out.","Initially, I read this dream in Vietnamese in my journal, but I couldn't understand what happened, so I chose something else. However, when I returned to select a dream again, I understood this one and would like to analyze it. There's something crucial I need to grasp because while working with my emotional birth angel Yelahiah, I've noticed continued resistance. I even avoid sleeping well and struggle to remember my dreams in detail. This week, I've been reflecting on my struggle with sharing and having deep conversations, one of my ex-boyfriend symbol's distortions that I had a resonance with. Diving deeper, I realized a root cause lies in my childhood: during a conflict with my brother, my mom told me to 'keep silent, don't say anything.' This left me crying uncontrollably, trying to make no sound. This experience created a shadow, leading me to withhold problems from my parents, even in the abuse cases I've mentioned. To this day, they remain unaware of what happened to me. This has formed a blocking within me, preventing me from sharing any feelings. Additionally, I'm now more prone to realizing my own actions, sometimes fearing that current issues, if repeated, could create similar future blockages. Additionally, I've felt itchy and my nose has been stiff ever since hearing about a dream of a man's infidelity. I find that it comes from my resonances when I do not follow my principles. I also need to work on it.",From PDF: A Box of Butterflies
