C01,D0010,01/05/2025,"I was sitting in a restaurant . There were two friends sitting in front of us and turning around to talk to us and two male friends sitting to my left. While we were there, I overheard something about an upcoming birthday but I wasn't sure whose it was. I also listened to some bad news but I couldn't remember. Eventually, a birthday cake appeared, and we all celebrated— it turned out to be for the male friend beside me, whose nickname was "" Mouse "". Another male friend joined in, pretending it was his birthday too, making everyone laugh. The atmosphere was joyful, and the male friend next to me—who felt like my boyfriend —was gentle and kind and I felt a warm connection between us. Later, the other male friend mentioned that he liked cheerful work, like the kind I do, and asked me to let him know if I heard of any similar job opportunities. That day, I met with some friends who are now very busy with their children. Even though they came to a gathering, they couldn't spend much time with the group. One of my friends called me by an ugly name many times, this time, I stood up for myself and told him not to speak to me that way, but he continued, and it exhausted me. During a short conversation, he asked what I had learned from DSSI and how I could prove my level. I felt uncomfortable. I didn't feel it was the right time or place to explain what I had learned, especially since he seemed focused only on concrete results. I refused to go into detail and kept evolving his questions, though apart from me feared that might damage our friendship. Finally, one of my friends wanted to share something she was passionate about and asked me to listen. But I started to sense that some of what she shared didn't feel right to me—it seemed to deny something negative or even harmful. I felt conflicted. I didn't think she would accept my perspective. I'm still unsure what the right thing is—for me or for her. I know she means well and wants to help, but I also know I need to be true to what I've learned and believe. Additionally, I hurt my right thumb twice recently, which reminded me how easy it is to judge others without seeing the full picture. Maybe what we see as someone's mistake is actually tied to a deeper story—or even karma from past lives. This helped me remember not to judge others. Coming home and observing the way my parents live I understand that there are some renunciations I should do deeply on myself and change myself, not changing others.",Comfortable,From PDF: Nourishing a Right Love

C01,D0014,15/05/2025,"Phap and another friend cycled past where I lived. I've also felt more connected to the love I receive in my life. For example, when some colleagues made mistakes, I initially felt frustrated and thought they should have been more careful. But instead of reacting, I stayed calm and shared my point of view gently. I've become more aware that I'm working with human beings, not robots, and that awareness makes me feel more connected to them. My mother recently reminded me that while I can be a vegetarian, I should consider eating what others eat in social situations, so I can be more easily accepted. At first, I might have resisted this advice, but now I understand it came from a place of love and concern. She's worried about me, and I no longer feel the need to argue like I used to. Instead, I appreciate her perspective and even encourage her to take care of her own health, especially since she was unhappy at the time. I respect the rhythm of my family and the wisdom it brings. I feel happy and softer than before. Of course, I'm still working on my insecurities — especially the desire for love and attention from others — but I'm starting to see that everything I seek already exists within me. And I'm learning to recognize and trust that more each day.",Uncomfortable,From PDF:

C01,D0060,22/05/2023,"Dear Prof Anthony and Dr Mayur, I am okay at this time. I learned a lot in this seminar. It is an opportunity to apply the Law of Resonance for my relationship. A part of myself prevented me from accepting this is my fault. I open another view. Sometimes I try to please someone to get love. To a point, I felt too lost, empty so I asked myself who I was. There was a discrepancy between my inner world and my outer world. I feel very touched after reading your revision this week. It encouraged me to continue working. I saw a part of my resistance. It does not want to change, to step. I asked myself what the thing I wanted to do. It is the way I must step but I am scared to step. I am not sure I can commit to do it or not. I am scared that one time I will run away, I will compromise. I thought I used to do it. I compromised many times and I got karmas so the light is clear and I need to step although my negative parts are there to keep me. These days, I got dreams every night, and I practiced mantras every time I have time. I saw an important thing it is the way I sing for myself. In the previous sometimes my way is not polite, not sacred. I change the way I sing, I would like to give the best voice with the softness for my soul. It is so blessed, so beautiful. The mantra helps me calm through the feelings alone, emotional dependencies, and emotional difficulties when my negative thoughts appear. Firstly, when I put a tax officer. I was scared because it is related to justice, sometimes I felt difficult every time it was related to government. This time, I just felt a little bit scared and everything is okay, he guided me clearly on what I should do. It can be easy to ask about my concerns. Secondly, today I just realize the love I received. As I shared, sometimes I felt disconnected. I can't feel the love for me. This morning, my boyfriend's sister contacted me to give me a present from my boyfriend's mother. I was confused if it is right to receive it at this time. I feel it is okay, it is a gift and I receive it with my appreciation. I called to my mother and talked about my niece and some normal stories. Sometimes I felt a little bit uncomfortable when my mom talked something. Then I spent one hour to talk with my boyfriend's mother about her gift, her life, ... naturally. After these two conversations, I felt a stranger feeling. I remembered the questions my mom asked me about the food, my difficulty, ... I feel so appreciated. I feel the love from my mother when I am far from my family. I feel the love from my boyfriend's mother. She told me the stories, and answered my questions. She also shared her health, her work naturally. Calling is one of the ways to show our love, our care. One more time, it helps me realize she represents my boyfriend's inner world, it always has pluses and minuses. My relationship is an experiment for us to learn and to do the right things. Sometimes, I felt difficult to deal with my negative thought. But I remember a guide from Prof Kaya in this seminar. Life is always a challenge. I am studying the way to give unconditional love with wisdom.",Embarrassed,From PDF: Separating class
