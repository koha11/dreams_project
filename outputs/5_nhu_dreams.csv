C0177,D0001,05/03/2021,"My colleagues and I hang out near my hometown. There are my boss, 2 staff and myself, 2 boys and 2 girls. We arrive and found that we have not enough motorbikes to go around. Everybody asks me to borrow my mother's motorbike. However, I hesitate to call my mom. Because I don't want my mom to know that I go travel near home but no coming home. At that time, there is only my mom at home. After that, everyone convinces me and I do call my mom. My mom says yes very easily. I feel relieved. Then, we get the motorbike and hang out.","Feeling worried, fear",From PDF: 02 Dream - Hanging out near hometown.
C0178,D0001,18/03/2021,"We have 3 people on a dirt road, rock, dust. Myself, Joe and Nhu. Joe (woman) is a technology team lead in my company. She is older than me. She is very kind, clear, protects the benefits for the team members and is fair to everyone. A person who always tries, works hard at work, works with 200% ability every day, always does everything in the best possible way, time clearly and expects good things in work and life. A person who loves the environment and animals. She is a green lifestyle person that I am also following. Nhu (woman) is a staff on my team. She is younger than me. She is very intelligent, proactive, positive, cheerful, and has clear, coherent, and logical work standards. She has the potential to become a leader in the future. We have only 1 motorbike. There are 2 roads in front (fork), I don't know which way to go. Both roads are detours, we can not see where to go. There is one road above and one below. There is a car pass by, it goes down the road below. We know for sure these two roads lead to the station and rest. At this time, there is a motorbike pass by and help us. We let Nhu go first. I will go later with Joe. The motorbike goes on the road above. Then, there was another car that continues going on the road below. This car was very weird. There was no roof. I feel it was made of faces wooden tables put together. A driver is a Western man. We decide to take the road that the motorbike went - the road above. Because I think the other road is only suitable for cars, not for motorbikes. The motorbike broke down before, we couldn't use it, and I don't know how the both of us could go to the station safely. We come to meet Nhu. Nhu said that she waited for us a long time. She thought as if we could not come, she also did not know how to contact us. She was very worried about us. It was a small station, a cement house, deserted around, opposite the other side of the road was a row of trees, on a rocky, sandy road. There is a small porch with a roof. There's a map here, so everyone can find their way back At this point, I just know that the 3 of us are on a trip and get lost. Before that, I had no idea why the 3 of us were here, where this is, how to return, why we had to go that way. Now, I know our purpose is to go to the station, to ask local people to contact us to return.","confusion, doing my best, worrying",From PDF: 03 Dream - Lost
C0179,D0001,26/03/2021,"In the evening, I and a female colleague have no place to rest, while tomorrow we have to go to work early with the boss. So the boss told us to go to his home for a rest. This boss is a man. To me, he represents gentleness, dignity, respect for women and love for children, loyalty, loving family, cute, likeness, having experiences that I can learn at work, always have positive energy, joy, enthusiasm, hard work, effort at work. His minus in me is that deep within him is a hot-tempered, forgetful person, someone in the framework, not very good in expertise and leadership, not a capable person with good leadership for me to follow in the long run. I see that he doesn't care much about internal affairs, maybe because of trusting me too much, I sometimes find it difficult at work that I'm not to be helped, but I don't ask him much because I think he can't give me best answer. I often make my own decisions. This colleague who I do not know in real life, however, this week (before the dream takes place) my company has a new female employee working directly with the boss (as in dream), not on my team. However, I have not met and talked to her (after the dream I did not see her back to work, I do not know if she will quit her job or not). I think his house is a block of houses about to be demolished , a bit old, a bit murky, L-shaped, 1 section has 1 floor, 1 section has 2 floors. In front of the house was a fairly large piece of land, filled with lush green weeds, sand, and stones from the house's dams. On the lawn, there were bricks (from his house, I guess) lined up to create a pathway to the house. Although I still feel that I am a positive person trying to change, my soul is too old. It needs beating and rebuilding WITH THE ANGELIC CODE. We kept going straight, but I looked to the left, and see an easier path, I headed in that direction. After I walked a bit, my boss disapproved, I didn't know whether he is angry or joking but hearing the voice, I felt that the tone was a bit angry. He said something like: going over there cannot be in the house. Why go that side? Come over to this side. I changed my way. We went in front of a dark room, right in the corner of the letter L. A person came out, I was introduced as the boss's father (this person I know in real life, this is the grandfather of my close friend). In real life, he is a famous painter. He is knowledgeable, intelligent, artistic, uplifting, romantic, with foresight. On the contrary, he is a fastidious, perfectionist. Part of me has not been in contact with him so much that I have not seen many minus points in him. He wondered who the two of us were. He looked annoyed. I saw him familiar and I asked him if he missed me. Then he turned on the light, put on his glasses, and looked at me, but he still didn't recognize me. He was angry, he said: he does not know you all, why do you appear and be friendly with him. He reminded my boss that these are strangers, be careful with them. Now I remember that he was old and forgetful person. I feel comfortable with this thought about him, though I have a little fear at first. After that, my boss asked for permission to take the two of us upstairs to rest. I still know that I have memories inside me about infidelity, but I don't know exact memories through this dream. I see 3, 1 man and 2 women. All of the 3 of us accompany together. No one leaves.","Worry, Fear, Word hard, Comfortable, Interesting",From PDF: 04 Dream - Rest in boss s house.
C0180,D0001,02/04/2021,"We were going to have a meal at a small fast food store in the supermarket. My sister and I thought that 1 burger for each one is enough. However, Giang said she hungry. Then, she ordered 2 pieces of chicken more: 1 for her, 1 for others. Fast food is related to no urish your instinctual needs rapidly but may not be good for our wellbeing..... Food is symbolic of the emotions and the thoughts that you nourish yourself with. So in the social level or while you are at work, you may try to nourish your instinctual needs (animals) and at the same time you are nourishing an aspect in you that is too down-to-earth, too focus on matter, too focus on results (chicken). And the chicken is a bird that cannot fly... So it will touch your thoughts (air) that could be too concentrate on your own needs... In a certain percentage... Fast food [- too fast, too many energies, too attentive to expression, too enthusiastic YES... And you can complete with comments above :-)... ] -> I focus too much on reception (femininity) on work, I don't feedback or express outside -> depress. YES, YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF UNABLE TO EXPRESS WITH PEACE AND CONFIDENCE BECAUSE OF THE CONFLICTING THOUGHTS INSIDE After that, Han comes. Han is my boss. She is younger than me but she's pretty good at work. She is delicate, insightful, intelligent, well-organized, and well- executed. She also studies spirituality, spends time with herself, loves herself, is a perfectionist. She is good at diplomacy, knows how to need it. An excellent woman. Besides, to me, she doesn't have good lead and teamwork skills. Han ordered a meal for her and added 3 pieces of chicken for everyone. So each person has an extra piece of chicken. SO YOU SEE HERE HOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO NOURISH YOUR INSTINCTUAL NEEDS... AND YOU HAVE YOUR ANSWER ABOUT THE PART-TIME JOB... YOU ARE SHOWN THAT YOU COULD BE TOO FOCUS ON YOUR NEEDS BEHIND THE INTENTION TO HAVE A PART-TIME JOB... UP ABOVE ARE SHOWING YOU THAT YOU HAVE INSECURITIES, MEMORIES OF BEING TOO DOWN-TO-EARTH (MATERIALISTIC) IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... THAT YOU CAN AMPLIFY IN YOU WHEN YOU HAVE A POWER OF DECISION... (BOSS WHO IS BUYING MORE CHICKEN)... -> When I go to spirituality deeper, I can balance the energy and perceptions on work, on the way of advance HERE IT IS MORE THE NEGATIVE ASPECT... AND IF SHE REPRESENTS A SPIRITUAL PERSON FOR YOU, IT MEANS THAT YOU CAN NOURISH THOSE INSTINCTUAL NEEDS PROFOUNDLY IN YOUR MEMORIES... BECAUSE SPIRITUALITY MEANS THAT IT TOUCHES THE CORE OF WHO YOU ARE... When Giang ordered 2 more, I thought it was redundant. At this point, a part of me doesn't take Giang's opinion seriously and doesn't care what she means, whatever she does. But when Han bought 3 pieces of chicken, I realized this shortcoming and thought that now it was enough for everyone to eat. Maybe I respect Han's opinion and know she will make the right decisions so I look at myself. THIS SCENE SHOWS A LACK OF DISCERNMENT... BECAUSE WHEN YOUR INNER GIANG IS ORDERING SOMETHING YOU DON'T REALLY AGREE BUT WHEN IT IS ANOTHER PERSON THAT YOU ESTEEM MORE OR WHO HAS POWER OF DECISION (BOSS) YOU CAN START TO LISTEN... SO IT MEANS THAT IN YOUR AFFIRMATION YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR POINT OF VIEW DEPENDING ON THE PERSON AND NOT DEPENDING ON THE IDEA IF IT IS RIGHT FOR YOUR EVOLUTION OR NOT... SO REGARDING THE PART-TIME JOB, DEPENDING ON THE PERCENTAGES OF THESE MEMORIES, YOU CAN EVENTUALLY LISTEN TO A PERSON'S ADVICE BASED ON THE PERSON WHO ADVICES INSTEAD OF THE IDEA IN ITSELF... BECAUSE ONE DAY WHEN WE ARE A GOOD LEADER, WE TAKE THE BEST IDEAS FROM EVERYONE... -> At work, I still lack respect for people and evaluate others according to my subjective opinion. This blocked my reception at work, causing my skills to not be expressed properly and sufficiently. I need to slow down and become deeper at work, observe more (Han), and learn more to receive and respond to the right work. When I am in balance, I can get the part-time job that I am wondering. AND IT IS ALSO A BEAUTIFUL INVITATION TO DEVELOP MORE DISCERNMENT... WHETHER YOU WOULD LIKE THIS PART-TIME JOB OUT OF INSECURITIES, NEEDS, OR WITH THE INTENTION TO DISCOVER YOURSELF, TO DEVELOP CERTAIN QUALITIES, TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON... SO YOU CAN BE AWARE TO NOT ALLOW JUDGMENTAL THOUGHTS OR EGO TO BLUR YOUR GLOBAL VISION... On the previous dream ""Rest in boss's house"" and last dreams, I received your explain but I don't think I can really understand the key of dream and I don't know what next to do or what I should do to clean the distortions. FOR THE KEY SYMBOLS OF THE DREAM, YOU WILL PROGRESSIVELY UNDERSTAND HOW EACH SYMBOL INTERACTS TOGETHER... HERE IS AN EXAMPLE: We were going to have a meal at a small fast food store in the supermarket (PUTTING THE STYLE SYMBOL) AND THEN YOU COULD PUT THE APPROPRIATE STYLE, NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE [- Fast food is a notion of nourishing instinctual needs in a fast way that could affect thoughts, emotions because of the food that are often unhealthy and the supermarket in the negative aspect is related 23/07/2025, 11:05 Eating fast food together | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/80185 2/4 to an activation of needs in the social level, difficulties to manage well the budget, difficulty to exchange in the social level, to have access resources, etc. ] HERE IS AN EXAMPLE SO AS TO HELP YOU TO GO DEEPER INTO YOUR DREAM... AND AFTER YOUR DREAM, YOU CAN TAKE TIME TO REFLECT ON THIS DREAM, TO SEE WHERE THOSE MEMORIES SHOWN IN THE DREAM CAN APPEAR IN YOUR CONCRETE REALITY, IN YOUR THOUGHTS, EMOTIONS OR BEHAVIORS... DREAMS ARE THERE SO AS WE CAN DISCOVER OUR POTENTIAL BUT ALSO TO BE AWARE OF OUR DISTORTIONS... SO AS TO TRANSFORM OUR NEGATIVE THOUGHTS, EMOTIONS AND BEHAVIOR... FOR E.G WHEN YOU FEEL YOU ARE SOMETIMES TOO MUCH IN SOCIAL LEVEL, IT CAN CREATE A DIFFICULTY TO INTERIORIZE... AND BY KNOWING THAT, YOU CAN EVENTUALLY CHANGE HABIT... SINCE YOU WILL KNOW THAT A PERIOD OF INTERIORIZATION IS GOOD FOR YOU IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU CAN COMPENSATE IN THE SOCIAL LEVEL AT TIMES... THE DREAMS ARE ALSO SHOWING THE CONSEQUENCES OF CERTAIN MEMORIES... FOR EXAMPLE, IF SOMEONE IS OFTEN COMPENSATING IN THE SOCIAL LEVEL, BEING OUTSIDE, AND NOT TAKING ENOUGH TIME TO MEDITATE, INTERIORIZE, IT CREATES EVENTUALLY LACK OF LOVE, EMPTINESS AND THIS LACK OF LOVE, EMPTINESS CAN CREATE CONSEQUENCES... SO TO CHANGE NEGATIVE HABITS, YOU CAN CHOOSE AN ANGEL THAT IS LINKED TO WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE... THEN WITH THE INTENTION OF CLEANSING YOUR DISTORTIONS, YOU CAN CHANT THE NAME OF THE ANGEL WITH THE INTENTION TO CHANGE NEGATIVE PATTERNS, WITH THE INTENTION TO BECOME BETTER SO AS TO PROGRESSIVELY LIVE HARMONY IN YOUR LIFE... WHILE YOU ARE UNDERSTANDING YOURSELF MORE AND MORE... . AND THIS CHANTING HELPS IN REACHING THE STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS REPRESENTED BY THE PARTICULAR ANGEL. AS WE GRADUALLY START TO TRANSCEND THE DISTORTIONS AS A NATURAL PROCESS WE START TO IMBIBE THE QUALITIES OF THAT ANGEL BECAUSE WE BECOME WHAT WE REPEAT... Eg: I have ""old patterns of having difficulties in relationship (lack of leadership), having difficulties to interiorize, to take time for yourself because of percentage in you where you could be too much in the social level, because of old patterns where you could repress certain memories, because of having anger and these memories could eventually create lack of love inside""... -> I am confused with the distortions and it is not clear what memory actually causes it. And what should I do with it? IT IS A BEAUTIFUL QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED DEAR NHU... IN THE PREVIOUS DREAM, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE LACK OF LOVE AS A ONE OF THE ROOT CAUSE OF INFIDELITY... INFIDELITY IS ABOUT LOOKING OUTSIDE WHAT IT IS MISSING INSIDE... AND THE PREVIOUS DREAM IS EXPLAINING WHY YOU CAN INDUCE THIS LACK OF LOVE... IT IS BECAUSE THERE ARE NEGATIVE MEMORIES INSIDE, SUCH AS OLD MEMORIES (OLD STRUCTURE OF THE HOUSE) THAT YOU HAVE KEPT FOR A CERTAIN MOMENT... SUCH AS ANGER, BEING BOSSY, REJECTING OTHERS (GRAND-FATHER), SUCH AS ""NO HOUSE TO REST"" AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DREAM... IMAGINE IN THE CONCRETE REALITY TO HAVE NO HOUSE TO RETURN HOME, IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO TAKE TIME TO REGENERATE YOUR ENERGY, TO TAKE TIME FOR YOURSELF TO MEDITATE SO THIS ASPECT ALSO COULD CREATE A LACK OF LOVE INSIDE... BECAUSE MEDITATION IS A PROFOUND WAY TO REGENERATE OUR INTENTION OF LOVE, TO GENERATE A GOOD INTENTION WHILE WE ARE MANIFESTING OURSELVES... AND ANGER, MATERIALISTIC NEEDS, INSECURITIES, BEING TOO PERFECTIONIST ETC, HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT THAT CREATES LACK OF LOVE INSIDE... SO THE DREAM IS SHOWING HOW THE MEMORIES ARE INTERACTING INSIDE OF YOU AND HOW IT CAN LEAD TO CERTAIN THOUGHTS, EMOTIONS, AND BEHAVIORS IN THE CONCRETE REALITY... DEPENDING ON THE PERCENTAGE OF MEMORIES... Beside, I don't understand about ""the key to the reasons behind your lack of motivation and laxity which you face in your life, and the reason why sometimes you act with too much emissivity"". I can understand that I have the grandfather inner, perfectionist makes me lack of leader and motivation while I can't fulfilling the desires of this personality within me. LIFE IS REALLY ABOUT EQUILIBRIUM... SO WHEN THERE IS A ""TOO MUCH"" SOMEWHERE, IT IS BECAUSE THERE IS A ""NOT ENOUGH"" AND THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE ALSO.... SOMETIMES YOU CAN FEEL A LACK OF MOTIVATION, AND LAZINESS IN CERTAIN ASPECTS OF YOUR LIFE BECAUSE, IN OTHER ASPECTS OF YOUR LIFE, YOU CAN BE TOO PERFECTIONIST... SO WHEN YOU HAVE TOO MUCH EMISSIVITY SOMEWHERE, IT IS BECAUSE THERE ARE MEMORIES WHERE YOU WERE NOT ENOUGH EMISSIVE... AND THIS STATEMENT IS VALID FOR EVERYTHING, IF WE LIKE SOMETHING TOO MUCH, IT MEANS THAT THERE IS A LACK SOMEWHERE... AND TO DEEPEN THIS ASPECT OF BEING TOO PERFECTIONIST, WHEN YOU ACT AS A NEGATIVE PERFECTIONIST IT TAKES AWAY THE JOY OF DOING THE TASK AT THE MOMENT, THAT IS WHY IN SUCH MOMENTS, IT IS GOOD TO TAKE TIME TO RETURN IN YOUR ""METAPHYSICAL HOME"" TO MEDITATE... SO AS TO PUT A GOOD INTENTION INSTEAD OF HAVING THIS UNSATISFIED PERFECTIONIST THAT CAN LEAD YOUR ACTIONS... THAT BEING SAID, BEING PERFECTIONIST CAN BE VERY POSITIVE... IT IS A MATTER OF INTENTION. IN THE NEGATIVE ASPECT, BEING OVER-PERFECTIONIST CAN CREATE FRUSTRATIONS, ANGER, IMPATIENCE, LACK OF LOVE BUT IF IT IS POSITIVE, IT CREATES REFINEMENT IN OUR QUALITIES, SATISFACTION OF OUR SOUL TO DO THE RIGHT THINGS, POSITIVE SELF-ESTEEM, BEING POSITIVELY PRIDE OF OURSELVES, ETC. You also mentioned ""you should be careful about your inner perfectionist who drains away the energy of enthusiasm from you"" -> what should I do with this? I should reduce my perfectionist? And I need to have more reception? YOU CAN COMPLETE WITH COMMENTS ABOVE... AS SAID ABOVE, PERFECTIONISM COULD BE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE DEPENDING ON THE INTENTION... AND IF YOU HAVE THE INTENTION TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON, TO DO YOUR BEST WHILE YOU ARE DETACH FROM THE RESULT, IT WILL CREATE A PROFOUND SATISFACTION... INSTEAD OF BEING UNSATISFIED AND FORCING IN MATTER TO ABSOLUTELY GET A RESULT... AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS IMPORTANT TO MEDITATE BECAUSE MEDITATION DEEPENS THE FORCE OF OUR INTENTION... AND YES... RECEPTIVITY IS ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND TOOL TO MEDITATE, TO UNDERSTAND OUR UNCONSCIOUS, TO RECEIVE INTUITION, GUIDANCE, AND DREAMS... IT IS BEAUTIFUL TO FEEL YOUR GREAT MOTIVATION TO UNDERSTAND YOURSELF EACH WEEK... I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE YOUR EFFORTS WITH A SENSE OF ACCEPTANCE OF YOURSELF WITH CLEMENCY AND WISDOM 23/07/2025, 11:05 Eating fast food together | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/80185 3/4 WITH VASARIAH AND LECABEL ÂN","Affair, Surprise, Enjoy, Satisfied",From PDF: 05 Dream - Eating fast food together.
C0181,D0001,09/04/2021,"Sometimes, when I talk to some friends, my nose gets very itchy. I don't know if I have a nose disease, but it only itches when I talk, other times it's normal. Recently, when I was talking to a friend about my dream knowledge, the symbol that I was learning to heal, my nose was itchy. I kept scratching it. -> nose: related to the air (thoughts), I think maybe I still haven't clear on my mind, I have too many thoughts that conflict. So I have problems when I speak out it out. They are not identical. YES, IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD... AND THE NOSE IS ALSO RELATED TO COMMUNICATION AS IT ALSO HELPS WITH PHONATION. IT IS ALSO RELATED TO THE CAPACITY TO SENSE AND FEEL IN OUR INNER WORLD. YES, YOU MAY HAVE CONFLICTING THOUGHTS WHILE YOU SPEAK AND THE ITCHING HELPS YOU TO TAKE A MOMENT AND RETHINK WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO SPEAK. AND THE ITCHES ARE ALSO RELATED TO MEMORIES THAT EMERGE FROM YOUR UNCONSCIOUS... AND THE NOSE IS ALSO RELATED TO THE FIRST CHAKRA, RELATED TO OUR INSTINCTINCTUAL ENERGY, NEEDS... SO YOU SEE WHEN YOU MAKE A LINK WITH YOUR QUESTION ABOVE, YOU CAN BE ALSO TOO FOCUS ON RESULT, ON MATTER, BECAUSE OF INSTINCTUAL NEEDS... AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT INSTINCTUAL NEEDS, WE TALK ABOUT THE FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF OUR SURVIVAL... THAT WE CAN FULFILL POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY... Besides, I feel cold inside, especially in my brain. It is normally very cold. I feel like there's always a thick ice sheet around my brain, cold and numb. THE COLD IS RELATED TO THE FROZEN EMOTIONS, IT IS RELATED TO THE MEMORIES MARKED BY LACK OF LOVE. THERE ARE MEMORIES RELATED TO THE EMOTIONAL COLDNESS IN THE COLLECTIVE, SO WHEN YOU ARE OUTSIDE, INTERACTING WITH THE PEOPLE THESE MEMORIES GET TRIGGERED. When I need to think a lot, my head hurts, especially at work IT COULD BE BECAUSE OF MANY THOUGHTS AT ONCE IN YOUR MIND. IT'S LIKE A COMPUTER WITH MANY PROGRAMS RUNNING AT ONCE AND THUS THE COMPUTER GETS HANGED. THEN EITHER THE PROGRAMS NEED TO BE OPENED/CLOSED AT THE RIGHT MOMENTOR THE COMPUTER NEEDS TO BE RESTARTED OR UPDATING THE CAPACITY OF THE COMPUTER :-). AND IF YOU HAVE HEADACHE IT IS BECAUSE YOU CAN BE OVER- EMISSIVE AT TIMES... YOU CAN FORCE YOURSELF TO THINK... AND IT CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOU ARE TOO FOCUS ON MATTER, ON RESULT... AND ONE DAY, WE CAN THINK FAST AND A LOT WITHOUT HAVING HEADACHE :-) AND TAKE A MOMENT TO REST THE THOUGHTS WITH A DEEP BREATHE, A GLASS OF WATER FOR A FEW MINUTE SO AS TO RESTART WITH A RENEWED ENERGY... The intensity of work and the specifics of work make me need to brainstorm a lot, so at first, I feel both painful and cold. Not only that, I just talk to the people around, I need to think about what I heard, I also had a headache. And after each time, it took me some time to rest, to calm my brain to start over. WE HAVE COMPASSION FOR YOU, FOR WHAT YOU ARE FACING, NHU. YOU CAN GRADUALLY INCULCATE THE HABIT OF MEDITATING EACH DAY FOR SOMETIMES.... 20 MINUTES IS RECOMMENDED... AND YOU DON'T NEED TO DO 20 MINUTES AT ONCE, YOU CAN MEDITATE FOR 5 MINUTES FEW TIMES A DAY. THIS WILL HELP YOU REMAIN CALM AND CENTERED THROUGHOUT THE DAY. ALSO, YOU CAN TRY DOING SOME BREATHING EXERCISES WHICH WILL HELP YOU TO CALM YOUR MIND AND MANAGE THE NUMBER OF THOUGHTS. THE CALM BREATH MAKES THE MIND CALM, WHILE RESTLESS BREATHING TRIGGERS RESTLESSNESS IN THE MIND. But in reality, it is normally always cold. It is related to my emotions. My emotion was frozen. So maybe I can't feel the emotion in life too. So far, when I discover my problem, I start to heal, change my thought, I feel better a little, but my brain still feels cold. IT IS BEAUTIFUL THAT YOU NOTICE A CHANGE IN YOU...IT'S A GOOD STEP TO CHANGE YOUR THOUGHTS AND THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF THINKING POSITIVELY WHILE TRANSFORMING NEGATIVITY..., AND TO REACH A STATE OF CONSTANT PEACE, IT REQUIRES EFFORTS AND TIME, AND YOU ARE BEAUTIFULLY DOING YOUR EFFORTS TO HEAL YOURSELF. I slowed down, thoughtless, but it was the same. IN MANY METHODS RELATED TO MEDITATION THEY TEACH TO EMPTY THE MIND... BUT IN REALITY, IT IS JUST ONE STEP... BECAUSE ONE DAY WE FULFILL THE MIND WITH POSITIVITY BY CONTINUOUSLY NOURISH OUR QUALITIES AND BY UNDERSTANDING THE NEGATIVE MEMORIES AND TO WORK ON IT... THAT IS WHY THE MANTRA IS SO POWERFUL... BECAUSE WE CAN FOCUS ON PROFOUND QUALITIES IN US WHILE WE ARE PROGRESSIVELY TRANSFORMING OUR HUMAN DISTORTIONS... AS YOU CONTINUE DOING THE MANTRA, GRADUALLY THE POSITIVE THOUGHTS WILL BECOME A MENTAL HABIT, AND THE POSITIVE THOUGHTS WILL INCARNATE MORE AND MORE IN YOUR EMOTIONS, IN YOUR EMOTIONS, IN YOUR BEHAVIORS SINCE WE BECOME WHAT WE REPEAT... THAT BEING SAID, IF YOU SEE THAT IN THE CONCRETE IT REALLY CREATE CONSEQUENCES, MORE DIFFICULTIES, YOU SHOULD SEE A DOCTOR TO CHECK IF EVERYTHING IS OK WITH YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH TO REALLY MARRY SPIRIT AND MATTER...

C0182,D0001,16/04/2021,"I went to an experimental zoo, I invited some friends to accompany me, including Nghia, a few men, and women, small family (adults, children). This zoo has dense forests , caves, and diverse terrain. Zoo showed that I was going slightly deep on instinctual needs. People walk in tunnels (caves type) with some orange furry monkeys , reddish-brown skinned on the walls, creepers . In this zoo, there is nothing between humans and animals, I find them very free, comfortable, close to them. They are very gentle and friendly, they are eating plants normally. Some children are scared, some are happy, I see them happy. Monkeys in zoo: I am not making a clear line between instinctive needs and spiritual, social needs, I am setting them free. I have it all in my mind and I think I'm doing my best by harmonizing them. I let everything grow naturally. Everyone goes a little further, to a place must cross a small lake. Someone passes, some didn't. I was going through. From this dream, I like being in harmony with nature, with society, wanting to harmonize with everything. When I was in the social class, I encountered many difficulties, problems at work, life, friends, colleagues, relatives, but I gradually realized the core of this is accepting and overcome together. Each other overcomes with their own abilities, we do not need to force ourselves too much, we do not let ourselves be too lax, but we need to follow our own rhythm. In the end, I will be happy and satisfied with the results, everyone will be happy with their own journey. I want to ask more about my manifestations. After finishing a meal, I often get very headaches and sleepy, I can't stand it without rest after a meal. I kept yawning. However, for me, I find myself more sleepy than everyone else, whether I eat a little or eat a lot, or I'm not full.

C0183,D0001,23/04/2021,"At the beginning of the week, I withdraw a sizable amount of cash from the bank to deposit it into another of my accounts. But when I loaded in with an ATM, I put the full amount in, I was a bit in a hurry to do this, so all my cash was stuck in the ATM and in my account also no extra enter money. I am quite worried that I will lose all of this money or not. I contacted a bank officer to talk about this emergency. I worry that when I go away the machine might open and someone will take all my money. Meanwhile, the Bank staff did not say clearly about my money being lost or not, they only recognized and responded that it would be processed. Money: energy. This shows that I have lost my energy in social life, in work. I worry too much about this lack of energy, while society feels it very normal.

At first, we went to the cafe, but there was one more colleague who was also my boss by rank. For me, I see he is a normal colleague. This is a man with a gentle personality, listening, careful but at the same time very difficult, not good at leadership. In the cafe, we just talked simply. Han talked about numerology, I also shared about the DSSI course, I feel the similarities between these two. After that, I intend to talk privately with Han in the meal after that, we go vegetarian, recently Han has switched to a vegetarian diet and she is a Buddhist. She is very deep and delicate. However, the male colleague also came along because his appointment was canceled. At the end of the meal, I had the opportunity to talk about work with Han. But when it comes out, it is not really light and meaningful. I really don't want that. It happened in the form of question and answer, query.

C0184,D0001,30/04/2021,"In my company, I take a day off from work. Later that day, Nob recorded the team's progress for me that day, in a notebook. Nob is my colleague. Nob is a Transguy (outside is a girl, but inside is a boy) Nob let me see what the team did that day, how happy it was. Especially at the end of the hour, everyone left. Nhu was going downstairs in a special way. Nhu is my staff, she appeared in my some other dreams. And Tam brought water pipes to repair. When I read it, I was very happy and humorous, partly due to the way Nob's storytelling. I think about memorizing past times and events, events where I might not be there, I want to know all of these. The next day I go to work. I am amazed that it was exactly the same day as yesterday, as Nob told me. I was really surprised. At the end of the day, Nhu goes downstairs in a funny way. It's crazy, a bit of walking, laughing, and jumping down each step, just like Nob had said yesterday. Even though I know it, I still found it very funny. Tam bring the plumbing to repair, I suggest helping her. The room where Tam brought a plumbing fixture to repair, accidentally was at the foot of the stairs where Nhu go down (this is not my company). The living room including a shower. I don't know why Tam took the plumbing pipe for repair, but Tam put the plumbing (a thick, dark rubber tube) in a bag, outside the room. I left my problems of emotions outside, I don't care if it matters but continue. Now it is broken. Tam took a bath before me. After taking a bath, Tam didn't have any clothes so Tam wrapped 2 towels , one above and one below. At this time, I was taking a bath, then suddenly a few partners came, all the men (masculinity) So I have to get into a corner to avoid it. My femininity is being invaded by masculinity, the fact that I am overly exaggeratingly hard, too hard, without inner reception. Fortunately, I just rinsed my wet body, not in time to put soap on me. I got a shirt right there, but I was short of pants. My pant was in a plumbing bag outside the door so I asked Tam to take it for me. Then Tam talked with the visitors a few sentences and asked permission to go out. She went to get me pants. From this dream, I am too focused on showing from the outside (having a lot of manliness), although I work flexibly, not rigid, cheerful, my expression is quite rigid. I do not care about inner reception, not attentive to emotions within me. I think this dream is also related to the way I express and talk to the outside. I find myself not communicating well. Sometimes I have one way in mind, but speak out in another one. Or there are times when I say it but I'm not sure if that's what I think or not. I often say things that displease others that are not my intention either. I felt that my ability to connect with my thoughts, my inner voice to show the outside, was greatly deflected. Sometimes I say ideas that are contradictory, heterogeneous and they compete with each other. In my mind, there are many contradictory thoughts that I do not know what is what I want, what is right, what is wrong.","Fun, Surprise, Humor, Worry, Feeling good",From PDF: 09 Dream - Days Off.

Here I think everyone is working but sitting posture like in a classroom. I think sometimes I opened too much or close too much, I can't balance things on work and social life. I hide my emotions inside and open a little outside. However, I am open-minded with stubbornness (door in middle of wall). It's not right emission. I have lack of leadership skill so when I work, I still feel that I need to learn more and more. I lack of belief in myself. There were a few people go in and out. I told a person at that time that the inside door should be opened, should not be closed as it is now, I don't know why. But I think since there are so many people going in and out, it would be a bit troublesome for the next person to open that door, so just close the outside door (middle of the wall). And everyone agrees. This dream shows I can't balance my emotions.","Shy, Afraid, awkwardness, Observing, Emotional, Self confident",From PDF: 10 Dream - Doors in classroom
C0185,D0002,07/05/2021,"I drove across the road close to my ex's work. After that, I go to a house. This is a space below the stairs, quite tight. I am washing and repairing motorbikes, about 3 - 4. It looks quite tight and closes together (motorbikes) because of the small space, but it is arranged straight and neat. Exactly like reality in ex's shop. I have many sources to advance in life, in work (motorbikes). Because of many sources so I have difficulty (small space) advancing even everything straight and neat. While I am washing motorbike (renew the way to advance) I think: whether my ex-lover accidentally walks over here, accidentally sees me or not. Because it's very close to where that person is. I have a feeling that if the person accidentally saw me, I would be a little shy because I did not pass by intentionally, just unintentionally, then he would ask why I came here, make excuses to talk to me. I was able to wash my motorbike for a while when an employee in his shop accidentally passed me. He drank water, sat on the chair next to me to rest. Then I lower my head to avoid him so he does not recognize me. When I went back and forth to get things, I lowered my head. That person did not notice at first, but after seeing this, he feels strange. Then, he looked down at me. I and he look at each other. Then he smiled at me, a social smile, I smiled back at him. After that, I continue doing my job. I think this week too many things happened and I have got all things stuck. I can't think out to analysis.","Shy, Afraid, awkwardness, Observing, Emotional, Self confident",From PDF: 10 Dream - Doors in classroom
C0186,D0001,21/05/2021,"SO THE FIRST SCENE SHOWS YOUR INNER WORLD WHEN YOU ARE AT WORK OR IN A LEARNING PROCESS There was a white house with a beautiful lake in front of the house. THE LAKE SHOWS YOUR EMOTIONAL LEVEL... AND THE NOTION OF PICTURE SHOWS THAT YOU ARE STUDYING CERTAIN STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP IN YOU... SUCH AS A BEAUTIFUL INNER AND SPIRITUAL (WHITE) STRUCTURE WITH CALM EMOTIONS (LAKE)... The house is on the dirt road, like in the countryside, across the road is a field. The house is surrounded by white high walls. HERE IN THE PLUS THE WHITE HOUSE SHOWS THE SPIRITUAL VALUES, PEACE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP REGARDING YOUR INTIMACY BUT SINCE THEY ARE HIGH WALLS, IT'S LIKE MAKING A BOUNDARY AROUND YOURSELF SO AS NOT TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO ENTER INTO YOUR PERSONAL SPACE... YOU ARE SHOWN A NEED FOR OVER-PROTECTING YOUR INTIMACY... AND THE NOTION OF COUNTRYSIDE + DIRTY ROAD MEANS THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES THAT YOU CAN LIVE IN THE SOCIAL LEVEL, HAVING DIFFICULTIES TO RENEW CERTAIN CONCEPTS (COUNTRYSIDE), HAVING A DIFFICULTY TO TAKE CARE OF THE WAY YOU ADVANCE IN LIFE, ETC. The last segment is when I go home. This house is just a brick house, not whitewashed. SO HOME IS WHERE YOU COME BACK TO YOUR INNER SPACE. YOU ARE REACHING TO THE MEMORIES OF YOUR INTIMACY AND BY RETURNING HOME, YOU ARE RETURNING IN THE ROOT CAUSE OF CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES THAT YOU SAW IN THE FIRST SCENE... . The house has a corrugated iron roof, surrounded by corrugated iron. THE CORRUGATION HAPPENS BECAUSE OF THE CONTACT BETWEEN IRON AND OXYGEN, IT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE NEGLECTED ALSO YOUR INNER ROOF... AND THE ROOF IS RELATED TO YOUR THOUGHTS BUT ALSO THE PROTECTION... SO IT MEANS THAT CERTAIN NEGATIVE MEMORIES CAN ENTER IN YOUR THOUGHTS... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... . Around the house are trees, bushes and many tall trees like in the middle of a forest. SO YOU ALSO SEE AN ASPECT WHERE YOU CAN BE WITHDRAWN INTO YOURSELF, WHERE YOU SOMETIMES PREFER TO WITHDRAW YOURSELF FROM SOCIETY... BECAUSE OF YOUR SENSITIVITY AND THE FOREST ALSO SHOWS THE MEMORIES RELATED TO CERTAIN ASPECTS THAT ARE UNCONSCIOUS AND THAT TOUCHES YOUR INSTINCTUAL NEEDS AND EMOTIONAL NEEDS.... It shows my inner intimacy is too old, not cared for and perfected, neglected (image of the house has not been whitewashed). Compared to when I go to work/study, I show a beautiful, simple and luxurious, discreet (high-walled white house), showing how I ascend on the social level. YES VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD... YOU CAN SEE A CERTAIN DISCREPANCY BETWEEN WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP (PICTURE) AND WHAT KIND OF MEMORIES YOU STILL HAVE INSIDE... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... When I got home it was almost dark, SO YOU ARE REACHING TO THE UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES... IT SHOWS PATTERNS THAT YOU ARE NOT ALWAYS AWARE OF... I I saw on the porch with my ex-lover [+ gentle, obedient, simple, loyal ] [- unfaithful, unclear, complicated ] and a friend (a man I don't know) drinking. YOU ARE ALSO BEING SHOWN AN UNKNOWN ASPECT OF YOU WHERE YOU ARE NOURISHING EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES AND HERE YOU SEE ALSO THAT YOU HAVE MEMORIES RELATED TO YOUR EX-LOVER, YOU HAVE STILL RESONANCES REGARDING THE SITUATION YOU LIVED WITH HIM AND THIS IS ALSO THE OLD HOUSE AND THE IRON ROOF THAT YOU HAVE NEGLECTED... SOMETIMES YOU CAN LET EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES, ANGER, MEMORIES OF BEING COMPLICATED ENTER IN YOUR THOUGHTS... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... THAT IS WHY YOU WANTED TO HAVE ""HIGH WALLS"" IN THE PICTURE... TO PROTECT YOUR INTIMACY... I'm pretty angry right now. I went in front of these two, I poured beer cans on their faces, then I threw objects around at my ex. When I throw an object, I put a lot of force but somehow I can't hit the person's face even if I have the right direction. It's only a small hit, doesn't affect much. THIS SHOWS HOW YOU DEAL WITH YOURSELF AND ALSO WITH OTHERS WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY AND ARE OPERATING WITH THE ENERGY OF YOUR INNER EX-LOVER AND AN INNER UNKNOWN MAN. YOU CAN BE TOO HARSH AND TOUGH ON YOURSELF AND OTHERS AND YOU CAN START TO REPRESS CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES INSTEAD OF UNDERSTANDING IT AND TRANSFORMING IT WITH PATIENCE AND SELF-COMPASSION... AND REMEMBER THAT IT WAS AN EXPERIMENTATION FOR YOUR SOUL, WHAT YOU HAVE LIVED WITH HIM... AND WITH TIME, EFFORTS, UNDERSTANDING YOU CAN GRADUALLY TRANSCEND THE MEMORIES AND THE LAW OF RESONANCE WILL REALLY HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT, IT WAS YOUR MEMORIES THAT ATTRACTED THIS SITUATION AND YOU HAVE ALL THE TOOLS TO TRANSFORM IT... Inside I still remember the mistakes of my ex, I still have feelings of hating this person that wants revenge. YES, WE UNDERSTAND... AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU CAN EXPLORE YOUR MEMORIES VIA THE LAW OF RESONANCE TO KNOW WHY YOU STILL HAVE ANGER... AND YOU CAN SEE HIM AS A PART OF YOU... YOU CAN REMIND YOURSELF THAT ""THE OTHER PERSON IS ME, HE/SHE IS SHOWING THE PERCENTAGE OF MEMORIES IN ME"" AND THEN GRADUALLY YOU CAN TRANSFORM THAT ANGER INTO UNDERSTANDING, INTO WISDOM... Then I closed the door and going up. I went upstairs to get ready for bed. Actually, my ex-lover understands this house very well, maybe this person used to live there before. So, even though the door was closed, my ex could still enter the house, and so did the other man, they followed me. But they just go into the house, they find a place to rest and they don't do anything to me. THIS PART OF THE DREAM SHOWS THAT THOSE NEGATIVE MEMORIES REPRESENTED BY YOUR EX-LOVER AND THIS UNKNOWN MAN CAN ENTER IN YOUR INNER STRUCTURE AND THEY CAN STILL AFFECT YOU... THE IMPRINTS OF PAST ACTIONS AND THEIR REPERCUSSIONS FOLLOW US IN EACH LIFETIME UNLESS WE CHOOSE TO TRANSCEND OUR MEMORIES. HERE UP ABOVE IS SHOWING YOU THAT YOU CAN TRY TO ESCAPE YOUR MEMORIES BY ELEVATING TO THE WORLD OF THOUGHTS, BUT THE MEMORIES ARE STILL THERE... WAITING TO BE TRANSFORMED.... Sometime later, in the middle of the night, THE SEEDS WHICH CAN MANIFEST IN FUTURE, IF THE AVOIDANCE/ESCAPE OF MEMORIES CONTINUES I heard a noise and I went down, and the two of them also got down. Suddenly, some people came to assassinate us. HERE YOU ARE SHOWN THE MEMORIES OF VIOLENCE AND DEEP HARSHNESS WITH OTHERS AND YOURSELF AND ALSO HOW YOU CAN REPRESS CERTAIN NEGATIVE MEMORIES... SOMETIMES YOU WOULD LIKE TO REPRESS THE SUFFERING THAT YOU HAVE LIVED WITH YOUR EX-LOVER BECAUSE YOU HAVE CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES UNDERSTANDING THE REASON FOR THIS ORDEAL... They pointed guns [- abuse of power, instinctual needs, destructive emissivity YES... ] at us. At this point, the other two men ran out of the house, but the other man has shot dead afterward. The leader of this group was about to shoot me but I dodged, I stood right next to the leader. At this moment, part of me is both controlling and influencing this man so that he can't shoot me, but he stands right next to me, even though I don't touch him, we're just next to each other. There were times when the leader pointed the gun at me but I manipulated him to point the gun the other way, as if he couldn't kill me. YOU SEE THAT YOU CAN BE VERY SMART AND INTELLIGENT SO AS TO AVOID AGGRESSIVITY OF OTHERS, YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU HAVE THE POWER TO INFLUENCE OTHERS BUT IT IS MORE A NOTION OF REJECTING THE FAULT ON OTHERS INSTEAD OF A REAL TRANSFORMATION... SO INSTEAD OF REPRESSING HARSHNESS, ANGER, YOU CAN USE YOUR INTELLIGENCE TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THOSE NEGATIVE MEMORIES TO GRADUALLY CLEANSE THESE MEMORIES AND THEIR RELATED PATTERNS IN LIFE... After that, a few people came, they were the accomplices of this group people, standing in front of me and the leader. They asked the leader why he didn't kill me, while I stood right next to him, I was on the left and he was on the right. I feel like I can control the leader and his gun. So I feel very safe right now, because I'm on the same side as the leader, and it seems my ex has run away. THERE ARE MEMORIES OF AGGRESSIVITY, REPRESSION THAT FURTHER AFFECT YOUR INNER PEACE, BUT YOUR MANIPULATIONS AND ESCAPISM MAKE YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE OVERCOME THIS VIOLENCE AND HARSHNESS. BUT THIS IS FOR SOME TIME AND THESE MEMORIES CAN AGAIN COME BACK AND AFFECT YOUR EMOTIONS AND MANIFESTATIONS.... AND IT IS ALSO A WARNING FOR YOUR SOUL BECAUSE YOU CAN LET ENTER CERTAIN NEGATIVE MEMORIES IN YOU THINKING THAT YOU ARE SOMEHOW RIGHT SINCE YOU NO LONGER FEEL THE DIFFICULTIES REPRESENTED BY YOUR EX-LOVER... BUT THIS ANGER IS REPRESSED.... I abused my power to make a part of my masculinity disappear (the dead man) to balance myself. And at the end of the dream, I almost chased away the rest of the masculinity, I control all the men in the dream which means my femininity is controlling the masculinity, making it suppress or disappear to not exposed. HERE IT IS RIGHT TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE THAT YOU STOPPED THOSE MEN, BUT THE END OF THE DREAM SHOWS NO RESOLUTION BECAUSE IN THAT KIND OF SITUATION, YOU SHOULD CALL YOUR INNER POLICE :-) IT'S AN INVITATION FROM THE UP ABOVE TO KEEP DOING MEDITATION AND CHANTING TO CLEANSE THESE MEMORIES OF AGGRESSIVITY AND HARSHNESS... THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT DREAM, NHU. IT UNFOLDS MEMORIES HIDDEN IN THE UNCONSCIOUS. AND REMEMBER THAT, THIS DREAM IS A PERCENTAGE OF WHO YOU ARE... AND ONCE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TRANSFORM THAT, YOU BUILD A STABLE INNER PEACE...

They are taking revenge on those who have hurt them, they revenge in work, in the marketplace. This man is a businessman, he also has a dark force behind him, like the mafia. This woman knows a lot about his work and personal, even though she doesn't know it all. -> 2 people represent my 2 polarities. The man is the same as my imagination when I was a child. And the woman is also a part of mine when I grow up, I think I don't have enough talent to be the boss of mafia, then I want to become the woman beside him who can help him in work. They are phoning (connect and communication) a few people who were also business partners. They had prepared everything for revenge in advance, just waiting for the time to announce. They call others and hinting about receiving retribution, while the other side still doesn't know what happened. Then they hang off. After only a few minutes, the man's phone rang again and again, but the man didn't pick up. Because he knew that the other person was getting revenge and they begged him for help. This man put his phone aside and put it on silent mode. As an act of victory, the man and woman made love (renew, relax, an act of intimacy between two lovers of the highest degree) in another room. This was their first time, even though they had known each other for a long time. For women, this man is very handsome, gallant, elegant, very respectful of women and knows how to behave, know how to be gentle. And this man has always been clear about giving: what he gets from others, he will return something similar, like revenge, he doesn't have much tolerance. This woman always trusts the man, she trusts almost absolutely, she believes and loves him. Meanwhile, this woman is also a smart, thoughtful and righteous person, so she sometimes listens and gives suggestions in this man's work. On the unconscious level, I have lack of love and lack of tolerance, while I need to work with karma of revenge, so I push and revenge myself too, I tend to make everything satisfy with inner by wrong way. I only focus on result. After they made love, the woman gets up to cook with the maid, it is still daytime. Then, this man gets up and being about to turn on the light switch in the corner to put on his shirt. Accidentally he is caught at the table in that corner. There is a window in this corner where this man could be seen by outsiders, dimly. Incidentally, the house right next to the woman's house is her sister's house. 2 windows can be seen each other. It is both a bedroom. And her sister (I don't know her) was also one of the people this man avenged. Although the woman knows this, she doesn't stop her. She thought this man did the right thing. Because according to the law of cause and effect, you will reap what you sow. Her sister accidentally caught a glimpse of this man in the other girl's bedroom, shirtless. Her sister dimly guesses and is looking for this man. This man also accidentally sees her sister, quickly hid and informed the woman about this. And he wants to run away and wants the girl to find a way to cope. He packs his things into a bag and runs upstairs. When he looks out at the balcony in front of the house, he sees her sister standing right in front of the gate. If she just looks up, she will see him, although entangled by a few branches, was very low. He immediately bent down. Her sister is on the phone, probably calling the girl. But perhaps contact could not be reached, her sister immediately runs through the gate to enter the house. The man follows the balcony upstairs, goes left, toward the railing, and jumps into the yard next door to hide. Although the height is quite tall high, he is fine and escapes successfully.","Interesting, happy, scare, anger, hatred, observing, loving, wise",From PDF: 12 Dream - Revenge and run away.

Because I have difficulty moving forward in reality, studying, so I tend to want to go back to the past, live in the past. I want to change the past to change the present for better. We walked out of the school, the road in front of the school seemed to fall between two banks of high ground, the grass was unevenly spread. This is quite a dusty road, red soil form. I want to go to the other side, I think it will be faster to cross the street. There is a close friend who goes with me, everyone still goes this side, maybe because going through the middle of the road will be quite dirty and dusty. I lack action to materialization work, imbalance on the advance way, so I seek the support from within, from unconscious, from up above to support me. I also want to do something different from what I have done in the past. After we went through some kind of difficult terrain together, we came to a place with beautiful scenery, trees, rocks, grasses. Everyone was quite excited, taking pictures from the corners. Several people thanked me for discovering this interesting place. Then everyone gathered and asked me to take pictures. I took 2 photos, on the 3rd photo, I said I don't take anymore, I want to go to the other side.

Although I know I lack the effort to materialize works, as well as I am too focused on the material, I am aware of those distortions but I still want to escape by living in the memories. In addition to the trees, I saw a white harmless shadow, probably a ghost. This shadow goes back and forth around the same place, I am not afraid of it and I feel it harmless. I wonder about it. It represents a percentage of me having difficulty learning, moving on, I'm stuck in place, while my distortions are still there, untransformed.

I thought I had a mild and prolonged illness, not a serious one. It's not really a disease of the type of rapid decline but physiological blood pressure. Causes: living in high mountains and long-term stress. These are the causes that I find myself suffering from and are likely to make my current anemia. Symptoms that I have - Feeling dizzy: when I go up and downstairs a lot, sit for a long time and suddenly change position. - Severe headache: The headache will get worse each time the brain is stressed or heavy physical activity. Each time there is a different degree of headache, sometimes more severe pain in the top of the head. Sometimes the pain is more severe, both painful and numb. - Decreased concentration: when the body lowers blood pressure, the blood supply to the brain will not be as normal as usual, thereby causing brain cells not to receive enough oxygen and nutrients to function properly. This is the main reason that hinders the ability to concentrate in people with low blood pressure. - Blurred vision: People with severely low blood pressure will show signs of hearing loss, reduced vision, blurred vision. Sudden blurred vision can be dangerous if you're on the road. - Nausea: I have nausea in stages, episodes. There was a time when I even suffered from acid reflux. - Cold, moist, or pale skin: When your blood pressure is low, your limbs often feel numb and cold inside. This is because your body is unable to maintain blood flow and oxygen delivery to the skin, causing hypothermia. This I find quite similar to the fact that I have a cold inside my body, in addition to being cold in my head, I am also cold in other parts, especially the joints of my legs and arms. - Fatigue: usually appears in the morning, I often feel mentally tired, my limbs are numb, tired, and have no vitality. In the afternoon or evening, the body appears tired again, although not just overworked. - Depression: Patients with low blood pressure often have a sluggish, sad mood and are very prone to depression. - Feeling thirsty: When blood pressure drops, the body will receive a signal from the brain to drink more water, adding more water will help increase blood pressure. I drink quite a lot of water and always feel thirsty. After I learned about the symptoms and causes, I found it all connected with emotional (water), lack of emotion (anemia, feeling thirsty all the time), no emotion (cold inside). ), living in the highlands (blurred vision), depression.",wondering,From PDF: 17 Life - Low blood pressure (hypotension)

I and another friend arrived early and waited in the schoolyard. I looked at the classrooms upstairs and was a bit scared because it was dark, it was not light at this time. We decided to wait in the schoolyard. I'm visiting old memories RELATED TO LEARNING (elementary school). The number 4 represents the building of the structure, the angel number 4 is ELEMIAH representing divine power. There are two people here as a couple. I have made an effort to understand the old memories, structures but have not reached the deeper level. I am afraid and lack of motivation to go into the deeper layers of memories in the unconscious (classrooms upstairs in the dark). After a while, about 4:30 AM, we went upstairs, we saw a group of friends was already there. I met an old friend here who is the host of the event. My friend joked with me that if I come early, I should go to class, not in the yard because it's not safe there. After that, more people came, we entered the class to learn Literature. A part of me subconsciously shows that entering the old memories is not scary and difficult. There are always things that help me discover, learn to correct myself (Literature subject), encourage me to continue and be bolder. After the class ended, a friend stood up and said that everyone should have a gift, but because of a mistake, it was not possible to give gifts to everyone. So now everyone needs to draw lots and the gifts will be sent back later. I have a hard to share with the people around me, sharing about the things I love and even difficulties. Therefore, I tend to seek quick happiness outside. I and my friend were drawn first. We went down in the end of class. There is a long stick with lots of numbers and letters glued on it. We need to place the finger on a certain letter and read the corresponding text. Right now, I think it was a gift. These words were accidentally held upside down by my friend, who picked and read them, but I don't quite understand, I still think this gift is a bit strange. After that, we continued to go down at the end of class. There was a box with pieces of paper inside, which needs to be shaken up and drawn lots. At this time, I realized that this was really a gift, the long stick was not a gift.","scare, feeling strange",From PDF: 21 Dream - Draw lots for gifts.

He wears a blue short-sleeved sweater, a white shirt inside like he usually wears. I feel that my learning is being limited, not expanded and enhanced on the outside (closed and cramped classroom). The Kaya teacher inside me somehow always encourages me to learn knowledge, but I have distortions about deepening and applying knowledge. After the class ended, he adds 5 different papers to the whole class. Each sheet of paper has both essays and multiple-choice questions. He said that he forgot it in the previous session. He needs everyone to do all the exercises in these 5 sheets. I have difficulty receiving information and opinions from the outside for repair, too separate between distortions, not understanding the connection between things to be corrected. I don't know how to get everyone to do these 5 sheets. I thought about collecting these exercises into one system (like scanning and uploading them online) for everyone to see. But then, I don't do this. I have lack of synchronization, lack of flexibility, too principled, lack of rigor. Next scene, I was giving these exercise sheets to Khai in the classroom, just me and Khai. Khai is an old elementary school friend. I think we are doing homework. I feel like I'm forcing Khai to do these exercises. And I feel like I'm mocking Khai, like this exercise is so simple that Khai can't do it, something like that. Khai is now very gentle. I feel like he is suffering, afraid, not daring to speak, not daring to react. And I find Khai very strange.",lack of love,From PDF: 22 Life - Kaya s math class. last case id: C0196.
C0198,D0001,22/10/2021,"I ride my moss green motorbike to a village. In this village, the houses are made of wood, quite rudimentary, on the red earth, it seems to be in a mountainous area. A group of people from the village were gathering in the main courtyard in the center to play something. I visited a house next to the main yard. I went to meet someone to pick up something or discuss something. There was an old woman walking towards me, walking very slowly and silently. She got on my motorbike, and then I noticed that I still had the key on my motorbike. I gently asked her: ""Do you want to test drive my motorbike? Let me guide you."" She remained silent, her movements very slow, perhaps because of her old age. Then she took off on the gas and sped away quickly and forcefully. At this time, I realized that the old woman was a robber. I ran after her, shouting: Robber! Robber! The person who discussed with me also ran after me to catch the robber to help me, also shouted ""Robber"" for everyone to help. I tried to follow her, I kept shouting ""Robber"" very loudly, but I don't understand why the group of people in the main courtyard didn't hear it, even though they were very close to us. Group of people representing the social level. When I focus too much on emission, on results, so other people (on the social level) don't care what I want. They just focus on their work. I finally caught up with her and my motorbike. I thought she looks so weak but drives so fast. I struggled with the old woman, she was quite strong. Then I also got the motorbike back, the old woman ran away. I found the motivation to move forward in society through transformation, and compassion (not chasing the old woman). I went to the group of people in the village who were sitting in the middle of the main yard, a bit annoyed, and asked why they didn't help me catch the robber. People turned to look at me in surprise and said: they didn't hear anything. I was startled to realize that from the beginning when I arrived they did not hear anything, even if I and the other person shouted loudly, only I could hear it.",State of mind: Receptivity,From PDF: 23 Dream - Motorbike theft
C0199,D0001,29/10/2021,"I live in a boarding house. I rent alone. The walls and doors, aisles & everything are mostly white. I am actively working with my inner self to purify my memories, but I am lost in spiritual knowledge to purify myself. The door of my room is quite strange. It has a full door and a half door. It's like having 2 wings, but the wall covered half of 1 wing. Both were used normally. The doors are locked quite tight. I often check them when at home. Sometimes I'm too open, sometimes I'm too closed. But I would close almost everything about my intimacy, and I became too closed for anyone to understand. At this time, I went to check the doors and saw that there had 2 tubes blocking the middle between the door and the wall. This make a gap, and the doors were still closed. I'm skeptical of my excessive self-contained (check often). I have mixed feelings of fear and negativity in the process of protecting and building intimacy. I'm afraid someone knows that. When I saw that, I was surprised and tried to push those 2 tubes out so that the door wouldn't open. I feel like something terrible is going to happen when the door is open. And then, 2 sisters in the 2 opposite rooms found myself pushing the 2 tubes out, so they rushed in and intentionally opened the door to my room. I am against them. I don't know these two sisters in real life but I feel like I have to stop them. If they get into my room, I'll meet something very terrible. A part of me shows a desire to show intimacy to others, and dig deeper, but I have a strong resistance, self- protection mechanisms, and intimacy to no one can know and leave myself unscathed by those effects. This could be linked to my emotional freeze. It is a self-forming and defense mechanism. The two sides struggled for a long time, these two people cursed me a lot. In the end, I was able to push the 2 tubes out and they couldn't get into my room. In the end, my resistance was won, and I kept my secrets that I could not reveal to others. But it also shows that revealing and accepting actions from the outside should be gentler, more correct without being too difficult and violent (against 2 sisters). I could look into the situation and talk to the 2 girls to solve the problem, ask why they did it, but I didn't. I chose to resist. This is understandable because inside I have an available mechanism. I need to work more to transform this built-in resistance so that there can be proper reception. This week, I also had another intention to see my sister again after weeks of social distancing. I intend to move in with her, and I plan to meet with her to see how the accommodation is arranged. Because I'm still wondering about moving back. I understand in terms of personality that the two sisters are not suitable for living together, although I have been with her a few times before, but most of them I hold back, keep quiet and say nothing. After working with myself, I understood distortions and resonances from family members. Partly, the space of my sister's house was not as airy and comfortable as to where I am now, so I was also quite hesitant. However, as soon as I got home, my mother called me and said that my parents were arguing. Because my parents hadn't same points about buying an exercise machine for my mom. In fact, my parents had quarreled many times before, so this time was no different. But I feel this is a signal from the universe to me when I set my intention to move in with her. The disagreement between my father and mother represents the imbalance between my masculine and feminine polarities. When I intend to move in with her, it means that I intend to transform memories related to family, 2 polarities, and family issues. It was activated immediately when I intended. And the conflict over the exercise machine showed that my family problems were related to material needs. It shows that I will have to work with material needs to transform negative memories related to family, 2 polarities, and these memories are quite harsh, unpleasant for me (when I just got back home, my mother called.) So here I am shown the distortions, memories and difficulties that I need to transform and overcome if I want to move in with her.",Afraid,From PDF: 24 Dream - Fighting with 2 sisters.

Outside there is a monster trying to kill us and especially me. Everyone hides in the room. Some of the men opened the door slightly to fight the monster, but then they died too. Some men show a part of my masculinity polarity. It shows that I am gradually finding a way to face my instinctive needs, my abuse of power, but I have not done it properly, so my efforts are canceled and unsuccessful. The monster inside of me is still too big and it's overwhelming me. I remember I ran to a stair. Monsters chase me. I fight with the monster.

A tendency to go round in circles, repeating the same patterns, same negatives experimentations without learning any lessons THE CIRCLE ALSO REPRESENTS CONCENTRATION, AND THE ATTITUDE TO WANTING RECEIVE AND NOT SHARE WITH OTHERS.

At the social level, in my work, I am abusing my power, demonstrating my power to materialize and develop my work, which causes difficult emotions for myself and those around me.

There are 4 people (not including me), both male and female. All are my bosses. My inner masculinity is abusing power to control me excessively, the imbalance between two polarities. We went to a resort that seemed to be in Ha Nam province, a rather far province (maybe). The resort is located on a high hill, overlooking the sea. The resort is quite luxurious, spacious, with many trees, quiet and especially without cameras. They come here to relax because there is no surveillance camera. It seems that these people do jobs that are not very transparent. I am in a state of laziness, wanting to rest, reminiscing about the past, lack of discipline. This happens when I want to hide, hide a part related to work, do not want to be clear and transparent. Everyone's having a good time, and I'm showing them around. There are genetically modified monsters who come to chase us, to kill and eat. My instinctual needs, power-focused needs are controlling me, causing my fundamentals to break, change. I ran away into the deep forest. Suddenly I saw a group of people having fun camping. Everyone is going camping on a bus. On the bus, people divided into many groups to play. I ask them to join and everyone is very welcome. I dug deep into the unconscious, looking for peace and security. But it also shows hiding deeper, not facing the truth. I go inside the bus. I sat down and saw monsters inside the bus seats. These seats are naturally connected by a zipper. People say take it off because it's so weird. But when someone pulls out, I see the monsters inside, I'm scared, I stop them. I lack social receptivity, I'm too isolated, I don't get along with society, I lack the ability to connect with other parts of me, which slows down my advancement in society. I'm afraid of expressing myself on a social level, everyone finds me weird. But I realized that I'm the only one who can see the monsters on the seats, no one else can see right now. But this strangeness is actually only I can see and this self-concealment is only seen and felt by me. People don't see my concealment, they just find it strange. Then, the monsters came out (from the seats) and others came in (from out of the bus), so everyone could see. But these monsters just want to kill me.

He turns it down quite low, about 20 degrees, but then he turns it up again to about 28 - 29 degrees. I asked him why he only adjusted 1 - 2 degrees lower than before, he said that it was enough. After that, he and I continued to discuss work. This man understands me quite wellm was able to balance qualities, needs of me and him. This man represents the balance of 2 polarities in me.

C0203,D0003,23/07/2025,"I went to Binh Thanh hospital. When I entered hospital, the staff informed me that my insurance card has expired, cannot be used. I was confused, they sent me information they exported from system, I found it to be slow to update, so I reported it to company. The company told me that this information was managed by the Ministry of Health so they couldn't process it right away, and in the end, I decided to do it without insurance. When I checked with doctor, doctor measured my blood pressure twice and said that my blood pressure readings are completely normal, no problems at all. I was surprised because that morning I still hadn't eaten anything to keep my body intact, went to doctor. I shared my symptoms, doctor just said that she did not detect my disease and gave me tonics to drink. I found it quite absurd, so next day, I continued to go to another hospital that I usually go to first. When measuring my blood pressure, doctor found that my blood pressure was low and asked me to do some tests on my heart, carotid arteries. I went to check all of them according to doctor's instructions, then she read results: I don't have low blood pressure, results are good and there is no cause for blood pressure. I was surprised again, continued to tell all my symptoms, especially emphasizing fact that I always felt cold in my head and inside my body, doctor reassured me and said that it could be due to a temporary psychological effect or because of atopic, cause blood pressure to be a bit low. And she also gave me tonics too. I was completely surprised by results of all examinations, at that time I was really having a headache, cold inside, I was hoping I could be given some medicine to relieve this pain, even temporarily. However, things were not quite what I expected. After that, I just took medicine for a few days, changed to angel Habuhiah to heal.

C0204,D0001,03/12/2021,"My company organizes outings. Everyone has to get 2 injections of the vaccine. The first injection is basic all-around protection, 2nd injection is for better protection. AND THE FACT THAT EVERYONE HAS ONE FIRST INJECTION BEFORE GOING OUT SHOWS THE % OF ATTITUDE IN YOU WHERE YOU WOULD SOMETIMES BE TOO KEEN TO COME OUT OF THE UNEASY SITUATION CONSIDERING THAT YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF THE SITUATION, BUT MIGHT NOT BE FULLY EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION. FOR E.G YOU CAN FEEL THAT THE TIME IS RIGHT TO CHANGE THE JOB, BUT PERHAPS YOUR PREPARATION FOR A CHANGE IS NOT FOOLPROOF AS OF NOW. IT IS LIKE CHANGING THE JOB WILL HELP YOU TO AVOID EXPERIENCING THE DIFFICULT EMOTIONS, MEMORIES THAT YOU CAN EVENTUALLY LIVE IN YOUR CURRENT JOB... BUT AS SAID IN THE PREVIOUS DREAM, IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO MEDITATE ON THE MEMORIES THAT YOU ARE LIVING IN YOUR CURRENT JOB... BECAUSE THESE MEMORIES WILL ACCOMPANY YOU EVERYWHERE AND EVEN AFTER THIS LIFE IF THESE MEMORIES ARE NOT TRANSFORMED INTO WISDOM... THAT IS WHY SEEING YOUR MEMORIES IN DREAMS IS SUCH A BLESSING FOR YOUR SOUL... BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE TOOLS TO REPROGRAM EVERYTHING... In working and relationships with colleagues, I lack understanding and sharing, and at the same time, I have excessive defensiveness while working with others. When we started going out, everyone had done with the first injection. AND IN THE LOGIC OF MATTER, IT NEEDS TO HAVE TIME BETWEEN THE FIRST AND THE SECOND INJECTION... SO HERE IT MEANS THAT YOU CAN BE TOO IMPATIENT, YOU WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND IN MATTER, TO LIVE SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY THAN YOUR ACTUAL JOB... BECAUSE THE COVID IS ALSO RELATED TO MANY COMPANIES THAT HAD TO CLOSE, IT IS THUS RELATED TO BANKRUPTCY, INSECURITIES, FEAR OF LOSING, AND THESE MEMORIES CREATE A NEED FOR MATERIAL ABUNDANCE AFTERWARDS... The second injection is self-injected, so there are brave people who inject themselves first. THE FACT THAT THE INJECTION IS SELF-INJECTED SHOWS THE MEMORIES OF TOO MUCH EMISSIVITY AND USE OF EXCESS OF WILLPOWER TO PROTECT ONESELF. ALSO SHOWS A LACK OF SUPPORTIVE INNER GOVERNMENT, IT MEANS A DIFFICULTY TO ORGANIZE AND CREATE THE RIGHT SUPPORT FOR YOURSELF. LACK OF INNER NURSE/DOCTOR ENERGY AT THE MOMENT WHICH CAN HELP TO PROTECT. SO HERE IT SHOWS ALSO THAT SOMETIMES YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO THINGS BY YOUR OWN... YOU CAN HAVE DIFFICULTIES ASKING FOR HELP, FOR SUPPORT WHEN IT IS NEEDED... YOU ARE SHOWN MEMORIES WHERE YOU CAN BE TOO INDEPENDENT... Most people will get the 2nd injection later. After the first injection, my limbs were weak, I was very tired. So I haven't injected 2nd yet. THE VACCINE CREATES A FIGHT MECHANISM IN THE BODY, WHEREIN THE BODY FIGHTS TO PROTECT ITSELF FROM THE NEUTRALIZED VIRUS. SO YOU FEEL EXHAUSTED AFTER THE FIRST VACCINE BECAUSE OF THE MEMORIES OF OVER-EMISSIVITY AND THUS A LACK OF MOTIVATION. AND THE COVID IS ALSO RELATED TO INSTINCTUAL NEEDS, LAZINESS THAT CAN GROW IN THE UNCONSCIOUSNESS... YOU SEE CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES TO UNDERSTAND EVIL... SO IT MEANS ALSO THAT YOU CAN HAVE CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES SEEING THE EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE OF YOUR CURRENT JOB AS YOU CAN BE HYPERSENSITIVE AND HAVE THE SENSATION OF NOT ADVANCING WELL IN YOUR LIFE... (LIMBS WERE WEAK)... I tend to separate myself from everyone else, so I can't understand the difficulties people face. I also refuse to help myself from colleagues when I am in trouble. This creates a contradiction within me, draining my energy and weakening it. Ly invited everyone in her team (another team in my company) to get the 2nd injection before returning. Because it was rumored that after the 2nd injection, they would have a fever (meaning that when they go home, they will have a rest easier, but depending on the person). And before going back, everyone decided to get the 2nd injection. I take the initiative in protecting myself and getting along, helping people in my work, but I do it with the purpose of healing myself, I have not understood the law of my resonance with those around me. Because of self-injection, everyone was quite scared. Ly picked up 2nd injection, but she could not self-inject. Ly asked another sister to inject for her. During that process, Ly was afraid and tried to stop her, but she didn't listen. She thinks that Ly is just too scared, the injection is okay and will be done quickly. A part of me, recognizing my own weakness on a social level, pushed myself to be stronger, more aggressive, more draconian, and more apathetic. I lacked listening and communicating with my inner parts After injecting, Ly came back to blame her, why she still inject. I added: if it were me, I would do it quickly too. I don't think it really hurts. After that, the injection will probably still bleed a little. I still don't inject.","State of mind: asking the question above : when is the right moment to change the job ? THERE IS AN INTENTION WHERE YOU WOULD LIKE TO ABSOLUTELY RECEIVE THE PROTECTION OF THE UNIVERSE... HAVING THE GUIDANCE SO AS TO BE PROTECTED... SO AS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU WILL NOT EXPERIENCE THE STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS OF BANKRUPTCY, INSECURITIES, ANXIETY ABOUT THE FUTURE... SO THIS DREAM IS NOT SHOWING A PRECISE TIME BUT RATHER THE INTENTION BETWEEN THE QUESTION YOU ASKED... WHERE YOU CAN LACK RECEPTIVITY AND BE MORE IN AN EMISSIVE DYNAMIC, WANTING TO DO THE INJECTION AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, TO BE PROTECTED FROM THE NEGATIVITY, FROM NEGATIVE SITUATIONS THAT CAN EVENTUALLY OCCUR IN THE FUTURE JOB...

C0205,D0001,27/05/2022,"Angel: 36 Menadel Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello Professor ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU I had no dreams this week while chanting Angel Menadel, and thanks to Menadel I have had time to reflect on the work I am doing and realize my connection with my physical Angel - Imamiah, recognizing my own errors and correcting them. OK, WE UNDERSTAND DEAR NHU... WE SEE THAT YOU HAVE SHARED A REAL LIFE INCIDENT... THIS IS A WONDERFUL IDEA... IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO DECODE YOUR CONCRETE LIFE SYMBOLICALLY... WE ARE HAPPY TO SEE YOU DOING IT SO WELL My job is about internal operations in the enterprise. I take care of setting up working procedures, setting standards for the work of each department, and guiding personnel to do the best work. And of course, while people work, there are always problems. And I am also the one who needs to see the problem, fix it and guide the staff to correct it. In particular, the companies I have worked with are all about technology products, so my operations are related to technology and engineering a lot. I understand that one of my important missions in this life is to fix the wrong codes in me - the living machine on the soul, individual level (physical, emotional, intellectual) and social level (family and work). WELL UNDERSTOOD :-)... AND IT IS ALWAYS THE ROLE OF A MANAGER... TO SOLVE PROBLEMS... AND WHEN WE SEE PROBLEMS IN AN EVOLUTIVE WAY, TO HELP US DEVELOP NEW QUALITIES, WE ALWAYS FIND A SOLUTION OR AN INSPIRATION TO FIND ANOTHER WAY 🌟 During this time, thanks to the angel Menadel, I was been activated some memories related to communication and management at work. I had a number of meetings to deal with process issues with my boss. And I have expressed disagreement with the solutions and ideas that the boss offers. At this time, I feel quite uncomfortable inside, I feel that I have a great negation with the ideas given by the boss, a feeling of imposition and inadequacy. I realized that the old patterns inside of me were very solid, they were hard to transform, so I need to listen more, be more patient and calmer. I also think these memories related to my leadership ability in previous lives, it tends to be repressive, aggressive, imposing, lack of empathy, and tolerance. Although later I realized that boss's opinions were not entirely true, he spoke with a very open, gentle and listening attitude. The problem is only on my side. YES... VERY GOOD... HERE YOU APPLIED RESONANCE AND REFERRED BACK TO YOURSELF INSTEAD OF BLAMING OTHERS ON THE OUTSIDE...WONDERFUL RECEPTIVITY IT IS NORMAL TO DISAGREE WITH OUR BOSS AT TIMES, AND IT IS PART OF THE TEAMWORK... BUT IF WE EXPRESS OUR OPINION WITHOUT GOING AGAINST THE OTHER PERSONALLY, JUST TO MAKE THE IDEA ADVANCE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, WITH A MENTALITY THAT THINKS MORE ABOUT THE TEAM, THEN A DISAGREEMENT CAN BECOME A GREAT EVOLUTIVE MOVEMENT... IT IS ALWAYS THE EGO THAT IS BEHIND THE UNCOMFORT OR A GREAT NEGATION... This week, I also had a small change in the way I work, more precisely the way our leadership team works. That is in the morning, the entire leader core will not work, but we gather together to exchange and talk about ideas and knowledge to develop the company in terms of strategy, also how to apply them to real work. And these sessions we will do at the cafe shops, where have open space to share comfortably. IT IS GOOD IDEA BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE OPEN UP WELL IN AN INFORMAL AMBIENCE... In the early sessions, the members went unevenly for some personal reasons, as well as the content in the shared stories also carried a lot of negative energy, I found myself not wanting to listen much, Although I am the main lead in these sessions. After the first 3 days, I realized that I refused a number of times to listen to people share, but I gave my opinion for people to follow. Then, today I thought and said to myself: these are the negative memories that resonate with me, please accept, understand myself, also them, and further transform myself, to listen more and empathize more. Today, I have adjusted the way I talk and listen, as well as give my suggestions to each person when they share, and also thank and give compliments when each person gives an opinion, whether it's bad or not. It might not be a good idea, but they all have good intentions to contribute to the joint operation, so I need to understand their intentions. GIVING COMPLIMENTS IS A VERY GOOD START DEAR NHU... HOWEVER, YOU CAN ALWAYS CHECK YOUR ENERGY... COMPLIMENTS SHOULD BE AUTHENTIC AND NOT TO IMPRESS OTHERS OR PLEASE THEIR EGO... IN YOUR SHARING YOU COMPLIMENTED PEOPLE EVEN WHEN THEIR IDEAS WERE NOT THAT GOOD... SO YES, YOU CAN STILL BE NON-JUDGMENTAL AND RECEPTIVE/COMPASSIONATE TOWARDS THEM, YOU CAN ENCOURAGE AND INSPIRE THEM THAT 'OK IT IS A GOOD START, BUT LET US THINK OF SOMETHING MORE AS WELL'... SO THAT THEY ARE INSPIRED TO THINK, TO INNOVATE... Those are some things that I have come to realize and continue to work with myself with angel Menadel. Thank you WONDERFUL...

C0207,D0001,10/06/2022,"When I got home (my house in my hometown) , it was very quiet. I heard the news that Phuong (my old friend) is holding a graduation party in the evening That lunch, Phuong wanted to meet me. At first, people asked me if I knew Phuong graduated, I said no, and I really didn't know. I understand people still think that we are very close, but they don't know that Phuong and I have not been in touch for a long time. But I still agree to meet Phuong at lunch. I hide, deny these memories and even my old friend (now I no longer have contact with this person). And I hide these memories, maybe I don't want people to know, I'm afraid they know (shown in the fact that people don't know me and Phuong are no longer in contact). But now, I have better reception, and more understanding of myself, so I agreed to meet Phuong. I walked in the house, wondering where my parents went. After a while, I saw my parents preparing gifts for Phuong It was a very large, black, cloth- brimmed hat. I wonder how this hat can be worn. It is too big for a person's head, it can only be displayed, but my parents made it by hand. I still don't understand why my parents made such a big hat, my parents just said: it's beautiful. The fact that the hat was made by my parents and the hand symbol shows that my blocked memories of wanting to hide, wanting to be the center, superiority complex, and ego, originate from my 2 polarities. And I was educated that those things are good things. Now, even though I was aware that it wasn't right (I found the hat to be too big), I still ignored it, without any action to stop it or explain it, to transform it (my parents still gave Phuong the hat). Then I went to see Phuong and attended Phuong's graduation ceremony, and my parents gave Phuong the hat (I'm not sure if this part happened, but I feel it is).","State of mind: Angelic hello Professor, ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU",From PDF: Life - Strange gift.

I can't remember any dreams this week, so I'll analyze the events of the week that happened. OK... On the morning I.E. PARTS OF YOUR CONSCIOUS WORLD of this Tuesday, a close friend of mine - Giang [- a part of my feminine POLARITY, my inner Giang, is a person with good listening and receptive ability, always kind and generous, ready to help people, and giving unconditionally with love, sincerity, honesty, and loyalty. But she is also someone who is sometimes a bit naive, a bit messy, and lacking in carefully thought ] , who is studying abroad in Canada, suddenly texted me, informing me that at the end of this year she will get married [- represents a legal union. The minus point is lack of loyalty, lack of recognition from the law, evasion, fraud ] and after marriage, she will settle abroad. This news surprised me, because with Giang, I am very sure that Giang will not marry and settle abroad because her family is still in Vietnam. But, everything changed. THE NEWS OF YOUR FRIEND GETTING MARRIED IS USUALLY CONSIDERED AS GOOD NEWS... THE EMOTION OF SURPRISE IN YOU THAT SHE IS SETTLING ABROAD DEPICTS THAT IN A SMALL % YOU CAN BE TOO ATTACHED TO OLD/EXISTING WAYS OT LIFE THEREBY MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT CHANGES, VARIABLES THAT COME IN THE JOURNEY OF LIFE... THIS CAN BLOCK YOUR CAPACITY TO MANIFEST AS WELL AND FUSE YOUR POLARITIES (SYMBOL OF MARRIAGE) This event showed my state of mind: wanting to run away to a far away place, without having to think too much and still be able to do everything, whether it's legal or not, working as I please. DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE THE CASE DEAR NHU... AS PER INFORMATION SHARED BY YOU, THERE IS NOTHING WRONG IN WANTING TO MARRY AND SETTLE ABROAD... EXCEPT OF COURSE IF THE PERSON TAKES THE DECISION TOO HASTILY OR WITH A NAIVE INTENTION, WITHOUT KNOWING WELL HER PARTNER... BUT HERE THERE IS NO MENTION OF THAT... SO YOU SEE MORE THAN ESCAPISM IT IS THE EXPRESSION OF 'BEING SURPRISED OR NOT ABLE TO BELIEVE' IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN CONTEMPLATE ON... WE ALSO FEEL AN ESSENCE IN YOU OF BEING JUDGEMENTAL ABOUT THIS PART OF YOU BECAUSE YOU FEEL ABANDONED BY HER IN A WAY... I.E. DIFFICULTY TO EMPATHISE WITH OTHER PERSON'S SITUATION On the same morning, a female leader in my team - Ms. Tu [- a part of my feminine, my inner Tu is a person with a high sense of responsibility in everything, too responsible, too meticulous, too perfectionist, too detailed, comparative, and meddling in other people's affairs (prying, paying attention), imposing, strict with themselves, overly sensitive and tend to make matters worse. She is lack of love, lack of securities, lack of recognition, superiority and inferiority complex REPRESENTS ASPECTS OF YOUR EMOTIONAL WORLD... ] , told me that she wanted to take a month's leave or quit her job [- represents the desire to rest. The minus point is that you can be too lazy, want to hide, and want to rest too much ] to stop everything, because she is currently unbalanced, and losing her consciousness of everything in life, making her unable to do anythingEVEN HERE, AS PER THE CONTEXT SHARED BY YOU; IT IS OK (NOT NEGATIVE) IF A PERSON IS FEELING FATIGUED, IMBALANCED DUE TO WORK (LIKE A 'BURN-OUT'), TO SOMETIMES TAKE AN INTERMISSION. As I listened to and shared with her some of my experiences, I realized that Ms. Tu is also experiencing some of the same mental health problems as I was during a period of severe depression. GOOD... HERE YOU ARE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH YOUR INNER MS. TU...THIS IS HELPING YOU TO LEARN EMPATHY AND COMPASSION FOR OTHERS. That day, after the above two stories happened, I felt like I was lost. I can't focus on work and want to do something out of my comfort zone or normal life. And I also ask myself: what should I do next? THIS IS BECAUSE YOU SEEM TO HAVE GONE IN A MODE OF COMPARISION DEAR NHU. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THAT EVERY PERSON HAS HIS/HER OWN LIFE PLAN. THESE SITUATIONS ARE ALSO A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO LEARN (BY APPLYING RESONANCE) FOR E.G. THROUGH YOUR FRIEND GIANG YOU COULD HAVE LEARNT THE IMPORTANCE OF NATURAL FLOW, ACCEPTANCE & RECEPTIVITY... AND THROUGH MS. TU YOU COULD HAVE REFERRED BACK TOWARDS IMBALANCE OR EXTREMISM (IF ANY) IN YOUR WORK STYLE AND HOW LACK OF BALANCE CAN LEAD TO TO FATIGUE... INSTEAD THERE WAS AN ELEMENT OF COMPARISION IN YOU... ITS LIKE HOW SOMETIMES WHEN LIFE BECOMES A ROUTINE THEN PEOPLE CAN WISH TO CHANGE THINGS AROUND... THIS GETS TRIGGERED ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY SEE PEOPLE/SITUATIONS AROUND THEM CHANGING... BUT IT IS ALSO INVITING YOU NOT TO BECOME TOO EXTREME IN YOUR WISH TO CHANGE... AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN COURSE... BECAUSE DEEP DOWN THERE COULD BE A % OF MOTIVATION TO GET OUT OF YOUR CURRENT LIFE, TO BE RICH AND DON'T HAVE TO DO TOO MANY EFFORTS AFTER... My current life is triggering distortions that I couldn't handle before (the main causes of my depression), and now it's resurfacing for me to keep working. This time, however, I learned to be more accepting, to listen, and to have more awareness and love. WONDERFUL NHU... YOU CAN QUESTION THAT WHAT IS THERE FOR YOU TO LEARN IN YOUR CURRENT LIFE... WHAT IS MAKING YOU NOT WANTING TO BE IN A 'NORMAL LIFE' ... NORMAL/SIMPLE CAN BE GOOD TOO... IMAGINE WHAT WOULD THE WORLD LOOK LIKE IF EVERYTHNG WAS ABNORMAL/COMPLICATED... SOMETIMES MEMORIES CAN DRIVE A PERSON TO LOOK FOR SOME SENSATION, WANTING TO PUSH THE BOUNDARIES ALWAYS... SOMETHING FOR YOU TO CONTEMPLATE DEAR NHU The next day, when I proposed to talk to my boss [- a part of my masculine, my inner boss is a person who has great listening and receptivity, has good concentration, is tolerant and giving with unconditional love, has empathy for people. He is also someone who lacks of love, lacks of recognition, lacks of security, a high ego, lack of leadership, but for me now, he is more balanced, more accepting, more aware, more fully and live more consciously, lets go of many negative things inside, purifies himself, no longer attach much to material things. As an example of developing inner qualities, of how to live and treat people, that I am looking to emulate ] about Ms. Tu's problem and some thoughts that I wanted, the talk that day was mostly my boss talking and I listen. My boss asked me to listen and understand, change the way I work and live by not trying to control everything, let go, listen and observe more. At this point, I completely understand what the boss said, because he also reminded me of these things a few times before, however, this time it seems like he expresses his suppressed emotions and tries to speak to me gently one more time. IT IS BEAUTIFUL THAT HE HAD A BEAUTIFUL ENERGY LIKE THIS... Therefore, in the talk that day, I hadn't expressed my desire or thoughts on behalf of me or everyone (I think I should suggest) in the company, but once again asked to change myself. At this point, I'm a bit sad and feel inhibited. But I understood that were issues I needed to change, and resonated with my boss as well as I needed to go inside to work on myself, not to keep trying to say any things that my boss didn't want to hear. YES YOUR INNER BOSS WAS MORE IN THE PLUS ENERGY IN THIS SITUATION, HOWEVER YOU HAVE MARKED HIM AS A MINUS SYMBOL... SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE TOO HARSH ON YOURSELF DEAR NHU... YOUR INNER BOSS GUIDED YOU WELL AND ENCOURAGED YOU TO BE MORE RECEPTIVE, BALANCED AND CHANGE THE WAY YOU WORK AND LIVE This fact shows that inside I still have a big resistance, lack of listening and understanding for my own distortions. I lack motivation and haven't really focused to work with my distortions yet. This is a sign that reminds me to work harder. YES BUT TRYING TOO HARD CAN CREATE MORE IMPATIENCE AND IMBALANCE ... REMEMBER WORKING ON YOURSELF REQUIRES YOU TO RESPECT YOUR NATURAL FLOW, COMPASSION AND PATIENCE... SLOWLY AS AWARENESS GROWS, CHANGES START TO HAPPEN... FOR E.G. YOU KNOW THAT IT IS GOOD TO GROW MORE PLANTS/TREES FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR PLANET BUT STILL EVERY SEED THAT YOU SOW, GROWS AT ITS OWN PACE, GENTLY, SLOWLY... YOU CANNOT PUSH A PLANT TO GROW FASTER... THIS IS HOW EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE WORKS... AT ITS OWN PACE.... WHILE IT IS GOOD TO BE FOCUSED AND MOTIVATED BUT YOU SEE, CLEANSING THE NEGATIVE MEMORIES CANNOT BE APPROACHED LIKE A PERFORMANCE GOAL/TARGET THAT YOU SET FOR YOUR OFFICE RELATED TASKS The next day, I went to a meeting with 2 other leaders in the company at a cafe. On the way, I met 2 policemen who were chasing a man on a motorbike violating traffic laws. When I entered the cafe, I continued to meet 2 policemen who came to check the documents of the cafe. This made me think as a signal that I needed to work with my inner couple and divine justice. When I finished the meeting and was about to leave, I met those 2 policemen who came back to check the papers and left before me. YES.. LIKE A CHECK MECHANISM FOR YOU TO REFLECT UPON HOW YOU ARE ADVANCING AND NOURISHING YOURSELF IN RELATION TO YOUR WORK :-) Currently, my work is quite stagnant and not pushed smoothly, I am quite depressed and confused about whether to continue working or not. I met a lot of resistance when working because of the knowledge of the industry, the way people work in this industry is almost only for material purposes, even they use tricks. I don't do any of these things, but working in this industry and doing this exposes me to distortions that my inner justice cannot accept. YES SOMETIMES IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO WORK IN A NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENT.

I usually only have 1 or 2 simple dresses, so I wear them and wait for everyone to get ready. Everyone is divided into different groups to go to the party. I lack receptivity on a social level, lack the ability to express myself properly, and may have been too receptive or too easily without knowing what is right for me. At the same time, it also shows the energy of wanting to be the center, wanting attention from everyone. I went with 2 older sisters (I don't know them in reality temporarily). These two are a happy couple. Flooded fields surround the house we live in, so the road to the house is made of dirt and not too wide. The way I move forward in a society that lacks wisdom, is overwhelmed by emotions, makes it difficult for me to express myself and move forward. The way I move forward is currently built by too much receptivity (3 women), imbalance, and lack of emissivity from masculine polarity. While the 3 of us were going out, we were joking about something and I slowly walked to the edge of the road, right next to the edge of the field. Jane saw that and went over and was about to catch me, but in the end, I was able to step back inside so I was okay. And when Jane went to help me, she lost her momentum and fell into the field. This over-receptiveness has made it difficult for me and even predisposed to or think to eliminate feminine polarity. Since the fields are not deep, I think Jane will be fine. Both me and Lucy stood there and waited for Jane to get up. But after a few seconds, the two of us saw that Jane did not move, so we both rushed in and pulled Jane up. While in the field, Jane was lying on her back. After pulling Jane up, the two of us patted her back and shook Jane up. Luckily, Jane choked on the water and woke up. At that moment, I think maybe the situation just was really dangerous. Lucy looked at her girlfriend, then she apologized and asked if Jane was okay. Jane very calmly said she was okay. To my surprise, Jane turned around and asked if I was okay. I said it's okay and thank you so much to Jane, Jane made me worry a lot. After that, because Jane got all wet, we decided not to go to the party anymore, but to have dinner somewhere else. Emotions are having an impact on what I do, act, and behave socially and personally. I lack the wisdom to see things clearly. I have decided to make it clear to Thuong (the girl I mentioned in my dream last week) again about the way we talk. I asked her to stop caring about me, and I sensed that this could be seen as the end of our relationship. And I accept that. I think if the way I communicate with her is wrong, I need to fix it but if it's only from one side of me it's very difficult to change, and she continues to care about me as before. There was a time when I avoided communicating with Thuong, but I don't think it's a good way either. So even if this action leads to the end of the relationship, I think it should be. Because Thuong has activated the lack of love in me too much, I need to go back to my inner to work and cleanse.",State of mind: ,From PDF: The lesbian couple and me.

C0213,D0001,16/09/2022,"I was in a research center. I was not locked up but I'd been in here for a long time and I really want to get out of here. I could only go out when I dream that Buddha and Buddha allow me to go out. I'm going into the mass of memories associated with being too theoretical, too many ideas, too thinking, lacking in realization, lacking in action. And I realized that I needed to be freed from my own thoughts. I want to be liberated by running away (Buddha). I also dreamed of Buddha in dreams nearby, but Buddha flew past me and never spoke to me. Then one night I dreamed that Buddha and I are both very big, sitting suspended in the sky and facing each other, below is a modern city. Buddha told me: it's time for you to go out. My hiding thoughts are multiplied, along with the materialization (modern city). Inner consent is a release and a wish that I pray for to get rid of my own thoughts. In this center, there are many programs have been set up to build and contribute. People invited me to join but I declined because I felt it was unsuitable. But then after I had this dream, the female director of the center came to see me and asked me to help everyone before leaving here. And I agreed. I met the project manager to hear about the plan and I pointed out 1 thing to change the plan for the better. It should distribute functional foods in the pharmacy channel, it will be very effective and improve its reputation.

However, when I was liberated, I gradually recognized my ability to actualize and demonstrate this ability, even though it had not been demonstrated in action (suggestions to the manager and discussed further).

C0213,D0003,16/09/2022,"This week while working with the angel Jeliel, I also had a surprise trip to another city. The reason I go is that I am currently quite stressed with work and my depression, it makes me unable to work a lot, I have a headache and cause work to be delayed for a long time. So I decided to go to a coastal city to rest a bit. The city I go to is also the city that Thuong is in, I know part of the reason I go is also that I want to meet Thuong and to<h4>clarify my feelings.</h4> I have met Thuong and we still talk like 2 normal friends, and I have clearly determined that we are normal friends. Because Thuong has inner wounds, she has unknowingly excessive concern for those around her without her knowledge. She and I have talked about this issue, and she has gradually realized and is also gradually paying attention to the change.

The day before I found out I got Covid, I told a friend: I wish I had been sick for 2 weeks so I could rest. Lately, I really want to rest comfortably, and be able to last a few weeks without affecting anyone. But with the stagnant work situation caused by me, I was hesitant to ask my boss to take a break.

I practice the rifles in class, but there were also many pistols in the room. The guns were stored in transparent glass cases. I hold the remote control to lock and open these boxes. When the other 2 friends used them to practice, I also carefully advised them to check whether the gun was real or fake. I hold the gun to check it carefully before letting them practice. Because real and fake guns are very similar, real guns are only slightly heavier than fake ones. And if the 2 friends were not careful, the guns explode, because there are bullets in them. The next day, Mr. Tam (my real-life middle school teacher) was the teacher of the class.

C0217,D0001,14/10/2022,"I don't remember any dreams this week, so I'll analyze the week's events. OK As I shared with you before, I have resigned from my current company. And last week, my boss [- a part of my masculine polarity, lack of assertiveness, lack of recognition, stubbornness, high self- esteem, too attached to responsibility, lack of inner wealth, there are many karmic consequences related to abundance, want to get rich quick ] made an appointment to talk to me. We talk freely in a cafe [- represents communication at the social level, the minus is difficulty in listening, receptive and communicating at the social level ] . I want to stop, change the way I construct and move forward in society to start a new path. However, I have difficulty receiving the distortions of my inner boss, difficulty communicating with myself to learn and transform. So, my resignation shows the wrong end when the distortions have not been properly understood and transformed. At first, we talked about health [- difficulty in self-observation to recognize physical and mental health problems, difficulty accepting treatments and understanding health problems, lack of understanding of the law of karma ] . My boss advised me to go for a check-up and exercise [- having problems related to masculine energy, difficulties in emissivity, acting, materializing ] . After that, we talked about the economic situation in the country and the world , the inflation situation, and the economic recession that will affect the next 1-2 years. A signal from the universe told me to go back inner to take care of my mental health and improve my materialization. Because in the email I sent to my boss I said that I was stressed and this affected my work efficiency. YES... IT WAS A WAY TO OPEN THE CONVERSATION... AND SYMBOLICALLY HE WAS BEHAVING LIKE A FATHER, WANTING TO TAKE CARE OF YOU BY TALKING ABOUT YOUR HEALTH... AND TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMIC RECESSION WAS ALSO A SIGN FOR YOU, BECAUSE YOU ARE ALSO LIVING A ""RECESSION"" IN TERMS OF WORK ACTIVITY AFTER QUITTING... AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU REPLACE THIS MOVEMENT IN YOUR LIFE ON THE RIGHT TRACK NOW... Finally, my boss talked to me about work. As in the content of the email, I have given 2 options, either give me a quit or move to a more suitable position. And I suggested quitting. However, my boss told me to move to a part-time job [- difficulty in understanding and learning lessons at work, need to correct my intentions to be right at work, in the way I construct, develop myself and move forward in society ] managing a project. I was a bit surprised because I expected to quit or move to another position but still work full-time. Because if I work part-time, I will definitely have to find another job to cover my monthly living expenses. And I don't want that, I hope to be able to focus entirely on one job. This show a high ego, too much masculine energy, and a lack of receptivity caused me to give 2 options for my boss to choose, from while the boss should have been the one to decide and discuss with me. Changing to a part-time position shows that I need to learn more lessons about receptivity, being too stubborn, having too many ideas, lacking materialization. WHILE IT IS OK TO SOMETIMES TAKE IT EASY OR PLAN YOUR WORK BETTER, BUT IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO BE PRACTICAL AND PRAGMATIC ABOUT IT DEAR NHU... RESIGNING FROM A JOB WITHOUT HAVING ANY OTHER JOB OPPORTUNITY IN YOUR HAND MIGHT NOT BE A GOOD DECISION... AND SHOW THAT YOU COULD HAVE BEEN ALSO TOO MUCH IN A FORM OF EGO, DRASTIC/EXTREME IN THE POSSIBILITIES FOR IMPROVEMENTS... THE SHARING ABOVE SHOWS A BIT OF DUALITY IN YOU... ON ONE HAND YOU INITIATED YOUR RESIGNATION AND ON THE OTHER HAND YOU ARE ALSO WORRIED ABOUT MANAGING EXPENSES... WHICH IS NORMAL TO TAKE CARE OF, OF COURSE... AT LEADERSHIP LEVEL THEY ARE GENERALLY GOOD IN UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE AND EMOTIONS...INSTEAD OF WRITING AN EMAIL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO FIRST HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH YOUR BOSS... YOU COULD HAVE SEEKED GUIDANCE FROM HIM... IT SEEMS THAT OWING TO YOUR INTERNAL CONFUSION AND PRESSURE YOU TOOK A RASH DECISION... EVEN THOUGH, YOU DON'T LIKE THE JOB BUT IT IS STILL IMPORTANT FOR YOU... TO MAINTAIN YOUR LIVING EXPENSES... YOU COULD HAVE TRANSITIONED TO SOME OTHER ROLE OR JOB (WHICH YOU LIKE) GRADUALLY.... BY PATIENTLY SEARCHING FOR IT AND TILL THEN YOU COULD HAVE CONTINUED WITH THE CURRENT JOB... IF THERE WAS STRESS BOTHERING YOU... YOU COULD HAVE RAISED THAT CONCERN WITH YOUR BOSS...THE ABOVE BEHAVIOR MAY HAVE GIVEN AN IMPRESSION THAT YOU ARE BEING TOO REACTIVE IN YOUR APPROACH... However, at that time, I thought that maybe I was affected by the post-covid so I was still a bit tired, my mind was a bit hazy, and I really didn't have any plans for the future. Though I do not have too much money to take a long break. So then I agreed. I decided to give it up to have some time to rest. So far, I still feel confused. I feel like I'm not ready for this break, it's like a rash decision to follow reason. I have talked to myself: I know my action comes from being too attached to responsibilities, being too harsh on myself, and at the same time it comes from being a high ego when I want to suggest quitting before my boss made a clear decision because I didn't want to be the passive recipient of that decision. ALSO IN AN UNCONSCIOUS SUBTLE WAY... THIS ALSO APPEARS TO BE A WAY FOR YOU TO ESCAPE FROM YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND DIFFICULTIES IN A %...YES IT IS IMPORTANT TO BALANCE WORK AND LIFE BUT IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO BE PRACTICAL IN YOUR DECISION MAKING... YOU COULD HAVE QUESTIONED YOURSELF - WAS THERE NO OTHER WAY APART FROM RESIGNING TO HANDLE YOUR CHALLENGES? And the fact that, when the decision was issued company-wide, people completely did not know why I was in a high management position, working full-time and being transferred to a part-time position and managing a small project. Outsiders would probably think this was a punishment. And after giving it out, everyone was surprised and asked me. But I also don't want to say why. AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO EVERYONE IN DETAILS... AND SIMPLY SAY THAT YOU WANTED TO EXPERIMENT SOMETHING ELSE... IT IS BETTER NOT TO ENTER IN TOO MUCH EXPLANATION IN THIESE MOMENTS... AND IT IS OK SOMETIMES TO TONE DOWN THE WORKLOAD SO AS TO DEAL WITH ISSUES IN A BALANCED WAY... BUT IT SHOULD BE DONE IN AN ANGELIC AND PROGRESSIVE WAY...IF YOU HAD ASKED FOR GUIDANCE WITHOUT RESIGNING... MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE GOT THE SAME OPTION (AS GIVEN BY YOUR BOSS NOW) TO GIVE YOU A BREATHER... SO THAT YOU CAN RECHARGE YOUR BATTERIES AND TAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITIES AGAIN...THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRACIOUS AND NICE WAY TO TRANSITION TO THE NEW PART-TIME ROLE WITHOUT CREATING ANY RIPPLES. WE FEEL, YOUR BOSS WAS BEING KIND TO NOT LET YOU GO AND INSTEAD SHOWED GOOD EMPATHY BY OFFERING A PART-TIME JOB... IN TODAY'S COMPETITIVE WORLD, IT IS NORMAL FOR COMPANIES TO LET GO SOME PEOPLE AND REPLACE THEM WITH FRESH TALENT OR OUTSOURCE SUCH ROLES TO OTHERS... INSTEAD HE RECOGNIZED YOUR QUALITES AND CAPABILITIES AND WAS ABLE TO RETAIN YOU BY OFFERING A PART-TIME PROJECT... THIS WAY HE IS GIVING YOU TIME TO BALANCE YOURSELF AND FIND ANOTHER JOB WITHOUT LOSING ALL YOUR EXPENSES... WHICH IS A WONDERFUL THING AND SOMETHING TO BE GRATEFUL FOR Besides me, there were also personnel adjustments in 2 other positions [- these are 2 girls, so they are parts of my feminine energy. I show I had adjusted a little the way I recept ] , which are personnel in my team, and these two were proposed and handled by me before finishing full-time work. The reason I left the company was because I wanted to stop, I realized that I did this job just for the money, but while I personally thought the job industry, the boss's way of thinking and everyone was not suitable for me. The fact that they do blockchain, launches a lot of projects just for money without bringing a real value to the community or yes but it hasn't become reality. At the same time, in the current environment and colleagues do not have much expertise and they only need to do things that have been done for a long time, even they do not understand too much about this blockchain industry. So when working with them, I find myself being dissolved, not learning more about skills or professional knowledge, but also being dragged into an unscientific way of working. And I cannot afford to drag them along even though I'm their leader. I also realized that I did not do the right thing.WE UNDERSTAND THAT DEAR NHU AND IN THE LONG TERM IT IS OK TO THINK LIKE THIS.

I realized that I took this job partly because I realized that everyone treated each other like brothers in the family, the boss treated employees very well, always putting the interests of the team first. This is also very true with my working mindset. However, since I joined a full-time company and a restructuring company, everything has changed. I found my resonance in the way the company and my boss changed. Now my boss cares a lot about health, and stops working day and night. Although I had talked to my boss before, at that time, perhaps his health had not been affected much, my boss still did not really understand and follow.

C0218,D0001,20/10/2022,"I met a friend - Thu [- a part of my feminine , she is too simple, too rational and thinks logically, emotional dependencies, high ego, superiority complex, need to be recognized, lacks understanding of the law of resonance and the law of karma, tendency to manipulate the psychology of others ] . She flew from another city to Ho Chi Minh City for business travel. Thu told me about the trouble of her with her girlfriend - Tram [- a part of my feminine, she thinks too much, superiority and inferiority complex, too many material needs, need to recognition, lack inner love, too attached to responsibilities, high ego, tend to pressure put perspective, perfectionist, lazy, tend to want to live the life of a hermit, run away ] , especially, Tram got medicine for depression a few years ago. Tram also overthinking like me. It's hard to make decisions or actions because she is stuck with thoughts about everything around the job like risk, how, result, why,... Tram compares herself to others. She wants to do the jobs that she loves, but she can't do them because there aren't so many chances in her hometown. When doing other jobs, she feels unsatisfied and she has frank, childish thoughts when talking to her boss. She is afraid to leave her hometown to go to the big city where there are more job opportunities. She always wondered why there are so many people who can both do what they love and earn enough money to support themselves and live the way they want. Therefore, now she's been out of school for a few years but still can't support herself. She is still dependent on her family. This caused her to put a lot of pressure on herself. I've noticed that she often overstates the issue, and I've noticed that often people who have a lot of thoughts that cause depression have a lot of thoughts, most of them negative. In those thoughts, there are logical and illogical things, but all are possible. THE UNIVERSE HAS ARRANGED FOR YOU TO MEET YOUR OWN RESONANCE, DEAR NHU... UP ABOVE LOVES YOU SO MUCH AND SYNCHRONIZED THIS MEETING SO THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT IT LIKE AN OBSERVER... SOMETIMES WHEN A PERSON IS LIVING A SITUATION, HE/SHE CAN BECOME BIASED OR TOO INVOLVED LEADING TO FEELINGS OF VICTIMHOOD...BUT WHEN HE/SHE LOOKS AT THE SAME SITUATION FOR OTHERS (AS AN OBSERVER), THERE IS DETACHMENT AND CLARITY... SO HERE YOU CAN SEE HOW A PART OF YOU CAN SOMETIMES BE DEAR NHU, IN YOUR STATE OF DEPRESSION... LACK OF DISCERNMENT, CONFUSION ETC... ALWAYS REMEMBER YOU WILL PUT IN SITUATIONS (WHETHER JOB OR OTHERWISE), THAT ARE NEEDED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR SOUL. SO EVEN IF YOU ARE IN A JOB THAT YOU DO NOT LIKE... DON'T FIGHT IT... ACCEPT IT... ASK FROM THE UNIVERSE WHAT IS IT THAT YOU HAVE TO LEARN FROM THIS SITUATIONS... YOU WILL BE SHOWN RESONANCES THROUGH DREAMS AND REAL SITUATIONS THAT YOU NEED TO WORK ON... AND WHEN THE CLEANSING HAPPENS, IN A VERY SMOOTH AND NICE WAY, THE UNIVERSE WILL ORGANIZE YOUR EXIT FROM THE CURRENT JOB AND WILL PLACE YOU TO THE NEXT SITUATION... WORKING ON YOURSELF IS A FULL-TIME JOB ... THE MORE YOU KEEP RESOLVING YOUR INNER RESONANCES, THE MORE YOUR OUTER SITUATIONS SHALL GET REARRANGED FOR BETTER POSSIBILITIES... THE BEST PART IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT ALL, IT'S THE JOB OF THE ANGELS TO SYNCHRONIZE EVERYTHING, AND IT'S UP TO YOU TO BE RECEPTIVE TO THIS FORCE OF HELP THAT IS ALWAYS THERE, TO DO THE STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION...YOUR FOCUS IS ONLY TOWARDS SELF WORK WITH A LOT OF PATIENCE AND HUMILITY I feel like the universe is answering my question a few weeks ago: how can I use DSSI knowledge to understand my depression? I find knowledge too abstract and impractical to understand and apply. I find myself having above things too, so I find myself often having thoughts that are contrary to the majority, things that rarely happen to me are still very normal. KNOWLEDGE REMAINS ABSTRACT TILL THE TIME IT IS IN YOUR THOUGHTS LIKE A CONCEPT... BUT EVENTUALLY YOU WILL EXPERIENCE CHANGE ONLY WHEN YOU APPLY IT IN THE CONCRETE... ELSE IT WILL BECOME AN INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY AND MAY NOT USHER IN REAL TRANSFORMATION. Thu couldn't help Tram, so they argued and Thu lost a lot of sleep. I explained to Thu that she was emotionally dependent on Tram and that she needed to expand her empathy about Tram's problems to understand Tram better, talk to Tram more gently, more slowly, not too rigidly, as well as gradually guide Tram to listen to herself. And to do that, Thu needs to change herself, and also heal herself to not be dependent and attached to others. Thu also listens and agrees with me that she will try to learn and change. I told Thu that change is not easy and fast, so don't expect quick change or count the time, but follow her own rhythm and accept it. SO YOU SEE HERE...WHEN YOU APPROACHED THE SAME SITUATION AS AN OBSERVER ... YOU WERE ABLE TO GUIDE AND SUGGEST HELP ON HOW TO CHANGE AND HANDLE THE SITUATION... SO IN A WAY YOU ARE ALSO TELLING THIS TO A PART OF YOU WHICH NEEDS TO LEARN EMOTIONAL BALANCE, NEEDS TO HAVE EMPATHY FOR SELF AND OTHERS ... MORE IMPORTANTLY TRY TO VIEW THE SITUATION FROM OTHER'S VIEWPOINT AS WELL AND NOT ALWAYS FROM YOUR OWN PERSPECTIVE. The next day, I was attending a live session with Professor Haritha about Lucid Dream SYMBOLICALLY SPEAKING YOU ARE LEARNING ABOUT A STATE WHICH IS SOMEWHAT IN TRANSITION FROM A CONSCIOUSNESS OF CONCRETE REALITY TO DEEPER REALMS OF THE WORLD OF DREAMS...IT IS LIKE AN IN-BETWEEN STATE...SOMETHING LIKE WHAT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING IN YOUR LIFE..

SOMETIMES YOU CAN BLOCK YOURSELF SURROUNDED BY YOUR OWN SITUATION SO MUCH THAT SOMETIMES YOU ARE NOT ABLE PERCIEVE OTHER PEOPLE'S LOVE AND CARE FOR YOU...YOU CAN INTROSPECT ON THIS DEAR NHU.... AS SHARED BY YOU, YOUR PARENTS, FAMILY CAN SOMETIMES BE TOO STERN BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD ALSO TRY TO DISCOVER AND RECIEVE THE UNDERLYING LOVE AND CARE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE FOR YOU . At the end of the session when I opened my phone, I accidentally saw a lot of missed calls [- represents the disconnection from surrounding parts and society. Here it shows me that I am in a phase of disconnection from my inner parts (calls from family) that I am the one who intentionally disconnects (turns off the phone). The minus point is that I lack inner communication to understand inner problems, I lack the receptivity to be able to communicate, and I have fears / psychological obstacles so I cannot connect clearly with myself YES BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS LOGICAL TO SHUT DOWN YOUR PHONE DURING A CONFERENCE, OTHERWISE IT COULD DISTURB OTHERS IF YOU TEXT OR HAVE A CALL DURING THE SESSION... 😇 IF THERE WAS NO EMERGENCY, IT'S OK... BUT IF YOU KNOW THAT YOU WILL HAVE AN IMPORTANT CALL OR THAT YOUR FATHER / MOTHER IS SICK AND NEED ASSISTANCE FOR EXAMPLE, THEN YOU NEED TO LET IT ON... IT DEPENDS ON THE SITUATION, BUT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE YOUR PHONE SHUT DOWN FOR 1-2 HOURS IF THERE IS NO EMERGENCY AS WELL :) AND YOU SEE YOUR RESONANCE WITH TRAM HERE...

People texted me and asked what I was doing and couldn't get through. It was late at night and the class wasn't over yet, so I turned off the phone to wait for the end of the class. Right now I am really worried and scared. I don't know why everyone is looking for me at the same time. I think about the fact that I just stopped my full-time job and switched to part-time without telling my family. I waited for it to settle down before speaking. Because my work problems often hurt my parents when I changed jobs many times without being stable. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU TELL THEM ANYWAY... BUT PRESENT IT IN A CONSTRUCTIVE WAY... SAY THAT YOU ARE LOOKING ACTIVELY FOR A NEW JOB, THAT YOU ARE LIVING A BEAUTIFUL RENEWAL INSIDE OF YOU AND THAT YOU NEEDED THIS CHANGE... IF YOU ARE WELL ALIGNED WITH THIS DECISION AND WELL CONCRETE AS WELL, YOUR FREQUENCY WILL BE SOLID IN FRONT OF THEM ALSO... I said to myself right now: calm down, it's not necessarily that, but if I'm right (if my parents accidentally find out) I will also be honest about the problem and I will accept my situation openly and honestly, without deception, and talk to my parents as gently and sincerely 19/08/2025, 21:45 Fear | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/102775 2/3 as possible so that they understand. The class ended, and it rained heavily, I took the opportunity to go home. After I settled down, I texted each family member that I was home late at night and didn't turn on my phone at night. The next morning, I took the initiative to call my mother again and talk about going to class of meditation and not answering the phone. And my mother replied with a smile that she hadn't seen me in a while, so she was suddenly worried that something had happened to me (at this time, I am happy and relieved because it is no big deal.) I explained to my mother. That day was Vietnamese Women's Day (an annual celebration for women in Vietnam), so I asked my mother a little and wished her a happy day. YOU REPAIRED BEAUTIFULLY HERE... IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO LET OUR LOVED ONES WITHOUT NEWS FOR A TOO LONG TIME... My father and sister also gently asked about me. YES... WONDERFUL... YOU CAN REFER TO WHAT WE HAVE MENTIONED ABOVE... THEY WERE JUST CONCERNED ABOUT YOU BUT YOU COULD NOT PERCIEVE IT THEN AS YOU GOT INFLUENCED BY YOUR OWN POINT OF VIEW Then I feel really thank you. I think I've stepped deeper into self-acceptance and healing. Before I was very afraid and negative when talking to my family about my problems, I mostly kept it a secret and didn't want them to know because I didn't feel their understanding and sympathy. But now I am gradually more open, and more receptive, and the feeling of fear is also much less. YES THIS A WONDERFUL STEP FORWARD... ACCEPTANCE IS ALWAYS THE FIRST STEP TO RESOLVE DIFFICULTIES AND CONFUSIONS...

So far, it was time for me to find a job, but I felt that my mood was just letting go of the old job, and now it was comfortable resting. So, although finding a new job is also urgent, I still decided to take a trip for myself. I went to Da Nang, a city with the sea and mountains.

Then I heard people screaming in some other rooms, so I found out that many children were also peeking in other rooms at the same time. Then the baby ran away. I was scared when I realize my own negative memories I needed to be cleansed, and at the same time I was afraid of other people realize them. Then I looked up at the wall between my room and the next room and saw that there was a roll of toilet paper and a clothes hanger already for me because my room ran out of toilet paper. At this moment, I suddenly feel very grateful. I guess maybe the previous person used this room, brought it and left it there quietly. I have the ability to continue the purification process and there are outside available resources to support me.","surprise, grateful",From PDF: Purification.
C0226,D0001,01/04/2022,"I go to a dermatologist. The clinic is a small, old and dark house. I have been to this female doctor a few times before. I am visiting old memories of my own healing power, inner and outer. The present shows that I have begun to identify my problems and begin to heal. This time, the doctor said: my skin had cured a lot, but there were still small acne spots, so I should take the medicine for another month. After that, if these small acnes are still present, I should stop taking the medicine and meet her again to see what the problem is. Now I feel relieved because it's like the doctor is speaking for me. Because I also think that the treatment is basically gone, but I don't understand why these spots keep popping up.Then I thanked the doctor and I went home. The dream shows that I am still too focused on results, wanting quick results. Meanwhile, I need to work with myself to transform resonant memories. The dream also shows that when I do my current job, I feel physically healed, however, it also indicates underlying issues that have not been deepened. I am still superficial with identifying and working with myself to understand knowledge and apply it to life. This dream is like a reality to me that happened over a week ago. I was also going to a dermatologist, a female doctor. She is different from the doctor in my dreams, the space is also different. I have been to the doctor a few times and have not cleared most of the acne. However, there are still a few acne spots that keep popping up and not going away (like in a dream). But the last time I went to the doctor, the doctor definitely told me: if you take the medicine this time, the acne will definitely go away. And I just said thank you and went home. I think this dream took place because my desire to change that doctor's answer was too high, so the dream turned out just as I wanted it to.",State of mind: ,From PDF: Dermatologist.

She asked me urgently for help, I reassured her and I asked her what was the problem. I lack the inner communication to really understand my distortions, currently, I am identifying in a superficial, not deep way. Distortions of my inner Thanh have woken me up. Here's an invitation from Up Above to let me work on distortions: lack of love, too many material needs, likes to show off, lack of recognition. She sent me a clip. This clip shows her grandmother seemingly possessed by a ghost and flying inside the house, flying around on the ceiling. Grandmother laughed and spoke menacingly like a witch. She flew like a flying broom, her face and voice were very scary. She didn't know what to do and she begged for help. Thanh called me for help very urgently and I think she call for everyone around. I lack empathy and tolerance when I see the distortions in my unconscious (grandmother), I panic and want to hide in the past to forget the present. I was very scared. I told her that I'm just an ordinary content writer , and I don't know how to help her. I refused and I tried to turn off the phone screen to get rid of the video with the horror face of Grandma, but I couldn't turn it off a few times. After a while, it was turned off. The clip made me quite scared and panicked. I reassured myself and covered my head with a blanket to try to sleep, but I still couldn't sleep. She kept texting and calling me for help, but I ignored it. I run away, scared, lacking understanding of my resonances. I was so scared that I woke up. My body froze and I was scared. But then I practice breathing to calm myself. After a while, I said to myself: hey everything in my dreams is a part of me, it's my resonance, I shouldn't deny it and don't help like that, because I need to understand that is also helping myself. I also realized that it was just a horror scene, and grandma still hasn't harmed anyone, she only flies and threatens by words. Thanh was also panicking, but nothing serious happened here, everyone has helped her also, so I should help her. After that, I said to myself: ok now I will go back to sleep, if I see Thanh again, I will help her. I am gradually understanding knowledge at the conscious level (when I wake up, I can reassure myself), knowledge has not really penetrated into my unconscious (dream).

C0228,D0001,19/04/2022,"I am walking in a village with dusty yellow dirt roads. Both sides of the road are old thatched houses. There are 2 policemen looking for certain objects. And I belong to these objects. At this time, the street was empty, everyone was afraid and hid in their house. The houses are only closed with a bamboo curtain. I hid in a nearby house when I saw the police approaching. Then the police came to the house where I was hiding. They opened the bamboo curtain up but didn't see anyone, in the meanwhile, I hid on the other side so they couldn't see. These memories easily enter my inner structure (house). My inner structures are protected so superficially, not tightly, so easily receptive that they can cause any thought or distortion to sneak in. At the same time, my inner justice (police) is not strictly controlled, so I have not been able to find out these distortions to work properly. Then there was a woman who helped me. The woman worked as a peddler. At this time she took a bicycle carrying street food to the office to sell and she took me along. I wear a very large conical hat that covers my whole body. I squatted down, and walked while sitting to hide. Everyone who saw it wondered and asked her what this was. She answered it was a cat she raised. It seems that everyone here knew this woman, so everyone respects her answer, delicately not asking any more questions or no one lifting the conical hat, although everyone finds it strange: Why does she need a big conical hat to cover such a cat? That morning I received this dream, when I woke up, I saw a dead lizard right in front of my room and ants around a lot and I cleaned it up.","Scare, afraid",From PDF: Life - Hide.
C0229,D0001,06/05/2022,"My intention: please help me understand my rigidity. My group of 4 people: 2 men & 2 women (this is my teammate and friend) IN THIS DREAM YOU CONNECT WITH ASPECTS RELATED TO YOUR AFFINITIES, CAPACITY TO HELP/SUPPORT (INNER FRIENDS), YOUR SOCIAL ASPECTS broke into BREAKING INTO SOME PLACE BRINGS IN AN ESSENCE OF FORCED OR UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY... THIS CAN SOMETIMES MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO ACCEPT THE NATURAL RHYTHM, ITS LIKE WANTING THINGS TOO FAST... THIS CAN OPEN UP ASPECTS FOR WHICH YOU MAY NOT BE READY YET AND HENCE CAN CREATE CONFUSIONS IN YOU... an organization (belonging to my unconscious, my inner structure, order and arrangement. The minus is lack of ability to organize, create order, lack of discipline ) to save people. This organization is based in a spaceship (belongs to the thinking world, and also carries emissivity energy. The minus is too dreamy, flighty, unrealistic, lacks the ability to actualize ) , which is quite modern. This organization turns people into other people to become a powerful army (represents obedience at the social level. The minus is abuse of power, oppression, aggression, slavery, lack of discipline ) , following their orders. Perhaps through genetic modification, or artificially (abuse of power, act on instinct ) , giving the army special abilities (similar to like Xmen movies). The opening of the dream shows that I am going into the memory related to megalomaniac, tyrant, profiteer; slavery, and repression (Angel 22) in order to fulfill an ideal, a great desire (spaceship). There may have been previous lives where I was part of the army that took over the colonies or even the leadership team to lead this. And it also shows that I have minus points in the role of a leader who wants to oppress, impose, and need others to follow me too much, which creates rigidity in my thinking and acting. I think this dream is the answer to the question: why I have the rigidity inside me. I can also understand it through my illness (cold inside, the brain always feels cold and frozen when I think too much). When we broke in, we were discovered and arrested. The first two men and women who received the information penalty (represents the education of the bad, the not so good, and a warning for people to change. The minus is difficulty in accepting and understanding mistakes and correcting mistakes, resistance to punishment, tendency to avoid, fear, lack of understanding that evil is for education ) through a messenger sent through a piece of paper (represents the ability to realize ideas. The piece of paper can be understood as the lack of receptivity to actualize ) . I don't remember exactly what the punishment is, but they'll be kept behind to do something and will be kept in human form. When I finished reading it, I realized that at least they had a chance to escape in the process. I still can't accept the negative memory, or really recognize what it is inside. At the same time, I still don't really understander the knowledge learned to transform so I still have this resistance inside. In my turn, I was transformed into a gilded human (is a fake appearance to hide the real person inside, but this is an action influenced by others PARTS OF YOU, so it can be understood that I am letting views, thoughts, and desires of other people or society impose on me because I lack confidence or overconfident in some cases ) , similar to their army. Before I could do anything, I was brought into the machine right next to me. The machine has 2 classes (related to the lack of inner love, the inner relationship, absence of wisdom - Angel 2 Jeliel ) . I was brought to the center by the force of movement without anyone touching me as if I could fly and go up on my own. Going through the first class, I was covered with a yellow layer, the whole body from head to toe (like the blue Xmen character). I don't know what my special ability is. Through the next class, I was inlaid with a darker gold layer. This scene show that my memories related to lack confidence or pleasure other people too much. After that, I was given a mask (represents protection. Minus points are hiding, hiding intentions, thoughts, lack of inner security ) to cover my nose and mouth (nose represents the reception and purification of air (thoughts) AND CAPACITY TO SMELL, WHICH ON THE MINUS IS RELATED WITH LOWER CHAKRAS I.E. NEEDS, INSTINCTUAL, ANIMALISTIC TENDENCIES. The mouth represents the physical intake of energy (food) I.E. NOURISHING YOURSELF WITH NEGATIVE, ILLUSORY ASPECTS... MOUTH ALSO REPRESENTS CAPACITY TO COMMUNICATE (WITH SELF AND OTHERS)... NEEDS TO SHINE CAN SOMETIMES LEAD TO BLOCKAGES IN YOU TO COMMUNICATE/EXPRESS IN THE RIGHT WAY ) because it glowed (represents the aura. The minus is lack of recognition, desire for prominence, bragging ) . This is considered a sign to identify their army. When I was finished, I was brought back to the old place with the group. Everyone was surprised and sympathized with me, because I was made into their army forever. People give me a secret: stop breathing (breath represents the act of receiving and exhaling air (thinking). Stop breathing in this case means stopping receiving negative thoughts related to memories of oppression, abuse of power, aggression, domination (army) ) for a moment, then the light will disappear. I did it. I stopped breathing for a very long time, then the light really disappeared, completely disappeared at that moment, and I took off the mask. Because I realize my distortions above so I tend to hide my needs, my intention in social level. A part of me know exactly how to transform that distortions (people give me tip), but just very small % (at that moment). The other man, who had been watching all the process, was quite stunned by everything that happened to me and the other two. Because, if I am gilded, it is a permanent transformation that I cannot change. Even though it's only on the outside, it's still my old mind and self on the inside. So, when I go out, I will be recognized as the army of this party and will be hated. I also observe my memories triggered with surprise attitude, no help here, and couldn't help too, it likes I accept this memories and I don't try to escape or resist.",rigidity,From PDF: Change appearance.

I'm not even sure if this man is my lover or not, showing the unconsciousness of my current actions] are running away [- is a manifestation of the inferiority complex. I may be scared, afraid to express myself because of a lack of confidence or fear of getting hurt, or fear that I will hurt others RUNNING AWAY FROM SOMETHING REPRESENTS MEMORIES OF FLEEING/ESCAPISM FROM RESPONSIBILITIES AND ALSO FROM NEGATIVE MEMORIES...] from something. The opening of the dream shows that I tend to avoid emitting myself at work. Because I have an inferiority complex, over-dependence, overprotection from what I consider to be bad in this environment. I lack awareness of the way I act. In real life, most of the people currently working in my company, including the Founder, are building the company & its activities the way they built the multi-level model before, so I feel there is a lot of coercion, lack of core values for society, lack of love & empathy for all people and investors. They are too attached to material things, their financial needs are too high, which makes them even very confident in what I think might be deceiving others, & they do so unconsciously without realizing it. I also noticed that they have a lot of superiority & inferiority complex inside them, leading to them being jealous, comparing, judging outside and even within the company. They flatter their boss. Many people in the company also have memories of infidelity. From the beginning, even when I became more & more aware of these things, I actually avoided private conversations, or out-of-work outings as much as possible. For the rest of the work, I always try to complete my best. However, perhaps I was supposed to not blend in with the environment. Everyone when working in the company at a management level or higher (I belong to this level) is required that: trust and commit to accompany the company to the end. Inside me, I really didn't believe that this company with this approach would succeed. But I still respect people & their ways, it just doesn't work for me. And actually, my intention in doing this is this: I hope to be able to transform the related karmic consequences of materialism, the complex of superiority & inferiority.

The wooden bed shows that I am still feeding myself with poverty, lack, rigidity, rudiment, lack of love ,PERSONAL INTIMACY (mattress) ] in the pit. In my current job and life, I am showing outward beauty, vitality, goodness (green grass), but I am covering up inner distortions because of the lack of organizational structure, nourished & created by my own material needs but from poverty, too rigid, lack of love & tolerance.

After that, we talked about work & life, maybe he & I were working together. Within these situations & distortions, I still seek rest and harmony from this work. Maybe because I think that this is also the best way for me to understand karma and transformation. I really think that I need to talk and communicate with people in the company more, instead of avoiding to be able to understand the lessons I need to learn better & more deeply. That morning when I woke up, I felt very tired & exhausted. The night before, I went to join the AMM session about Habuhiah Angel in UCM Vietnam office. My inner struggle created external exhaustion, which through individual meditation, meditation with others, increased the activation of memories, making this struggle fatigue manifest in my physical body.

The two of us were drinking water and the last ones to go to rest. Perhaps in my childhood, I was shown that I was protected by family, friends and my inner Phuong too much, so I did not have many experiences and conflicts with life (inner Thanh). These memories gradually formed a part of me. When I was no longer protected by inner Phuong, I gradually built a shell to protect myself, built by feminine polarity, creating difficulty in receiving, listening, and even denying the protection of others.

My inner ghosts show I go deeper into layers of memory about my repressed instinctive needs, which have not yet been understood and transformed. And my current work environment has triggered this.

My inner Giang even saw but she didn't have a way to solve them. After that, we started searching on Ipad for information to drive them away. At this point, ghosts realized that we wanted to kick them out, so all the keywords we searched for ""ghost, devil"" were automatically deleted or replaced with another word. I thought maybe my typing speed is slow, so they can change it. Then, I asked Siri to search more quickly. And in fact, when I speak, ghosts also intervene, and Siri can't listen to look up for me. I am still dependent on the outside world too much, I have not really gone inside to transform and solve the problem at the root, but I seek temporary help because I lack security inside and these solutions give me solace. At the same time, I can also feel that I am too independent, because I may have thought that I will be able to solve it on my own, so I do not want to depend on or need help of my family (I didn't go to my parent's house). After that, my friends need to leave, they advise me to go back to my parents' house or call my housemate to come home early if possible. And fortunately, my housemate returned just in time.","Scared, feeling bad, afraid",From PDF: 06 Dream - The ghosts in house [2023]
C0236,D0001,01/04/2023,"I chanted Angel Leuviah with the intention that: please help me understand the memories of my old best friend HERE YOU CAN REFINE THIS QUESTION BY SAYING ""WHAT ARE MY RESONANCES WITH MY OLD BEST FRIEND ?"" TO GET DEEPER IN THE MEMORIES RELATED TO FRIENDSHIP THAT CREATES BLOCKAGES IN DEVELOPING UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, DETACHMENT, BALANCE IN POLARITIES ETC. I have no dreams so I will share our stories and some decode that I can understand. Phuong is my childhood friend (the one I mentioned in dream ""Childhood friend""). Our mother is colleague and we were born in the same year. We go to school together. From elementary school to high school, most of the time we were in the same class. We were companions in almost everything during our childhood, from hanging out with friends, doing things together, going to extra classes, even skipping school together. When we're together, mostly Phuong will be the one to protect and support me. Even though I'm the same age, I always call Phuong an older sister. And I don't know what comes from that Phuong always protects me, protects me. Partly since I was born I have been quite thin and small, while Phuong is much taller and also has had a high degree of independence since childhood. SO HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE NEED TO FEEL PROTECTED CREATES DEPENDENCIES AND COMPLEXES RELATED TO INFERIORITY AND SUPERIORITY BECAUSE OF LACK OF UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE ALWAYS PROTECTED, EVEN IN DIFFICULT TIMES. During this time, I realized that I had no particular personality. As for me, whatever it is, I have no opinions or desires. AND THIS IS COMING FROM PAST LIVES AS A MONK WHERE YOU WERE FOCUSED ON ""EMPTY YOUR MIND"" Maybe when at home, my family chooses for me, and when outside, Phuong is the one to do it. Gradually, I asked myself the question: what is my personality, what do I want, what do I love. WONDERFUL SELF-QUESTIONING It's like everything I learn follows Phuong. This period may have gradually revealed the manifestations of my apathy (a major cause of my depression in recent years). YES, ALSO THIS OVER-DEPENDENCY ON OTHERS SOMEHOW CREATES A LACK OF IDENTITY, AND SELF-RECOGNITION INSIDE. Even if Phuong loves a music group, she shared it with me. I don't know if I like them or not, but then gradually when I follow this group, I engraved in my heart that I also love them and I don't really know what it is. AS IT CREATES A LACK OF DISCERNMENT. There was once when we chose a high school to attend (a big school in province or a school in Saigon - a better educational environment, so we can pass the exam to a good University). And Phuong chose to move to Saigon, while I have no idea, I just want to go away from home. And Phuong told me that if we go to different schools, our relationship will not be as close as before. And that's one of the reasons why I chose the same high school as Phuong. Even though it's a very expensive school and far from home (a boarding school in Saigon). SO HERE YOU CAN SEE THE MEMORIES OF EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES THAT CREATE A LACK OF DISCERNMENT AND AFFECT YOUR CAPACITY TO DECIDE AND TAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS. And during 3 years in high school, I gradually realized that I was almost like Phuong's shadow YES, BECAUSE OF A LACK OF SELF- ACKNOWLEDGMENT, AND SELF-IDENTITY. With everyone, we are always together, so no matter what, it will be enough just to tell Phuong, and Phuong will decide everything. And no matter what happens, Phuong will always be the one to notice me, ask about me, and take care of me first BUT THIS CREATES AN IMBALANCE DEAR NHU AS IT CREATES DEPENDENCIES. TRUE UNCONDITIONAL LOVE HELPS DEVELOP DETACHMENT, AUTONOMY AND ABOVE ALL SELF-RESPECT. HERE AS EVERYTHING IS DECIDED BY PHUONG, THIS CREATES DISCREPANCIES DEEP INSIDE YOU . And because of these consolations, I am happy and secure in Phuong's protection, I rely on Phuong, but I have overlooked some things that are important to me YES, ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS THAT YOU HAVE OVERLOOKED IS YOUR OWN INNER POTENTIAL TO DECIDE WHAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU... The universe arranged for Phuong and me to go to different senior classes, and later to different universities. I gradually had to make my own decisions, communicate with people and express myself more. I find that the way I show myself has many actions and gestures like Phuong, although inside I feel quite confident, I realize that I am only confident in a very small circle. But out of that circle, I was scared, self-deprecating and timid. YES AND THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE OVER-DEPENDENCIES ON EVERYTHING ON PHUONG... When I was at university, I was completely separated from Phuong in terms of residence, school, and circle of friends, I really had a clear space to continue to learn the lessons that the Universe arranged and reexamine the relationship with Phuong. During the 4 years, we had times when we didn't see each other. At this time, I am like a bird released from a cage, I plunge into social events, participate in many activities, jobs about starting a business, getting rich, and activities at school. While Phuong is the opposite, most Phuong rarely participates in activities, but Phuong focuses on resting, making friends, and having fun with friends. SO YOU CAN SEE HOW FOLLOWING YOUR LIFE PROGRAM CAN FREE YOU FROM THE DEPENDENCIES AND HELP YOU REALIZE YOUR OWN INNER POTENTIAL... And up to a time, Phuong told me: Phuong heard from our friends that I have changed a lot since university. They see me as a person with unlimited positive energy toward career and personal development. This is also the period when I started to have debts for investment and business to establish a business. I also did not think that I was reckless enough to dare to owe a huge amount of money when I was a student, when I could not earn much money. And especially before that, I had no concept that I needed a lot of money, before that, I was just an ordinary person and lived a normal life, with no special interests. BECAUSE THE DEPENDENCIES IN THE PAST CREATED THE OTHER EXTREME IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE FOR THE FREEDOM AND HERE THIS FREEDOM IS MORE INCLINED TOWARDS MATERIAL POSSESSIONS AND NOT THE TRUE INNER FREEDOM... IN THE PAST, YOU WERE MORE LIKE AN ANCIENT MONK WHO WAS TOO DETACHED FROM MATTER BUT THE MATERIALISTIC MEMORIES FROM EVEN DEEPER ANCIENT PAST LIVES WERE NOT ACTIVATED... When entering the Internship to prepare for graduation, I have a lot of worries about investments, my own business, debts and family, and Phuong has environmental work problems with colleagues, bosses. And Phuong came to me to share. At this time, for me, these problems I have experienced a lot and understand in depth when I have been in contact with many businesses and people outside of society. And I share Phuong my advices, but maybe because she doesn't have as much experience as me, we can't understand each other, and I feel like I can't listen to other people's problems anymore. BECAUSE EARLIER THERE WAS NO LIMIT OR BOUNDARIES IN YOUR DEPENDENCIES ON PHUONG , SO NOW THE SOUL WANTS TO HAVE THOSE BOUNDARIES, AND LIMITS IN ORDER TO PROTECT ITS INTIMACY, BUT THIS CREATES A DISTANCE AS THERE IS LESS UNDERSTANDING NOW. IN A WAY, IF YOU OBSERVE THE PATTERN AND THINK DEEPLY, YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE WAS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING EARLIER ALSO BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME PHUONG WAS DECIDING FOR YOU AND YOU WERE FOLLOWING BECAUSE OF A LACK OF INNER ASSERTION... And a few months before we graduated, I decided to end our 22-year friendship, because I don't know any better way to stop receiving problems from Phuong. Looking back now, I know I was too harsh on myself, in this relationship. Because maybe I have a very high ego inside OK..BUT THERE IS ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE ALSO THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER AND THAT IS RELATED TO THE DYNAMICS OF LACK AND COMPENSATION OF 23/07/2025, 12:13 22-year friendship | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/108424 2/3 DEPENDENCIES AND FREEDOM OF CHOICE, the Universe has arranged that during my childhood I did not have the opportunity to express myself, and when I was able to express myself, I overreacted. I also learned about 2 polarity relationships. Because during University time, Phuong once admitted to me that she was a lesbian. At that time, I don't really know how it will affect our relationship, so I just listen and let it be. SO YOU SEE THE WAY YOU USE THE WORD ""SOULMATE"" IN THE PERSONAL RESEARCH IS ACTUALLY SHOWING YOU THE MEMORIES OF DISCREPANCIES AND IMBALANCE IN THE POLARITIES AS NORMALLY THIS WORD SHOULD BE USED IN A COUPLE RELATIONSHIP... From my inner Phuong, I can realize that I have comparisons, low self-esteem, a tendency to be jealous when I am not valued, even bad thoughts about the person who protected me. But I know this is a lesson that the Universe has arranged for me to understand myself and realize what I need to transform. ALSO, THESE MEMORIES ARE A RESULT OF YOUR OVER-DEPENDENCIES ON PHUONG ALSO...
