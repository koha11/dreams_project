That is the reason why I am at the intellectual level more than at the emotional level. Sometimes, I just find a\nway to adjust my thoughts and then adjust my feelings. I also see that I do not notice my feelings enough, but I can discern my thoughts\nwhen it has a problem. This is one of the reasons making me have difficulty analyzing this dream.\nI asked myself: "How am I nourishing my emotions? Are emotions important to me?"

I tried to breathe through the heaviness, and at the end of this\npractice, I felt softer and had a strange feeling at my third chakra.

I heard this voice many times, when I wanted to learn English deeply after working. The voice\ntold me that I was forcing myself, I needed to respect my rhythm, so I do not make efforts, and I need to change to relax.

Eventually, a birthday cake\nappeared, and we all celebrated— it turned out to be for the male friend beside me, whose nickname was " Mouse ".\nAnother male friend joined in, pretending it was his birthday too, making everyone laugh.\nThe atmosphere was joyful, and the male friend next to me—who felt like my boyfriend —was gentle and kind and I felt a warm\nconnection between us.\nLater, the other male friend mentioned that he liked cheerful work, like the kind I do, and asked me to let him know if I heard of any\nsimilar job opportunities.\n(https://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/system/file\ns/styles/original_with_autorotate/\nprivate/dreams/1874/restaurant_\n0.jpg?itok=U6MPUIAP)\nDuyen Dam (/fr/users/duyen-dam)\n\ue675 (/fr/dream-journal/1874)\ue612 (/fr/assignments/1874)\n\ue654 (/fr/user/1874/myresults)\ue938 (/fr/meditations/1874)\n\ue65eStudent,\nCorrector\nL1 - English pr…\n\ue613\n\ue916\ue915\ue914\n\ue69f\n\ue626100% (9/9) …\n\ue6b2\nÂn Nguyễn, Danièle Kremer\nSymbols\na restaurant\n-\nturning around\n-\nMouse\n-\nAnother male friend\n-\nthe male friend\n-\n(/fr/users/duyen-dam#profile-main)\n21/08/2025, 09:39\nNourishing a Right Love | IRSS Portal - Mikaël Universe/City\nhttps://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/node/132710\n1/2\nThat day, I met with some friends who are now very busy with their children. Even though they came to a gathering, they couldn\'t spend\nmuch time with the group. One of my friends called me by an ugly name many times, this time, I stood up for myself and told him not to\nspeak to me that way, but he continued, and it exhausted me. During a short conversation, he asked what I had learned from DSSI and\nhow I could prove my level. I felt uncomfortable. I didn\'t feel it was the right time or place to explain what I had learned, especially since\nhe seemed focused only on concrete results. I refused to go into detail and kept evolving his questions, though apart from me feared\nthat might damage our friendship.\nFinally, one of my friends wanted to share something she was passionate about and asked me to listen. But I started to sense that some\nof what she shared didn\'t feel right to me—it seemed to deny something negative or even harmful. I felt conflicted. I didn\'t think she\nwould accept my perspective. I\'m still unsure what the right thing is—for me or for her. I know she means well and wants to help, but I\nalso know I need to be true to what I\'ve learned and believe.\nAdditionally, I hurt my right thumb twice recently, which reminded me how easy it is to judge others without seeing the full picture.\nMaybe what we see as someone\'s mistake is actually tied to a deeper story—or even karma from past lives. This helped me remember\nnot to judge others. Coming home and observing the way my parents live I understand that there are some renunciations I should do\ndeeply on myself and change myself, not changing others.\nTHANK YOU', 'state_of_mind': None, 'notes': 'From PDF: 102.

{'case_id': 'C01', 'dream_id': 'D0003', 'date': None, 'dream_text': 'Angelic Hello Dear Danièle\nThis week, I achieved significant efficiency by restructuring my coffee business. A team member\nsuggested a better salary, prompting me to reconsider. After discussions with my boss and manager,\nI implemented a new KPI and Revenue structure for my coffee team, offering increased bonuses for\ngoal achievement. Other new structures were also introduced. While not exactly what she expected,\nit confirmed I had listened to her concerns. I reflected on why this weighed so heavily on me,\nrealizing my appreciation for her efforts in the store. However, I recognized a need to improve how I\nmanifest my intentions. I must commit to following my structure, including random task evaluations,\nwhich will offer a new perspective to the team. I need to act more as a manager and less as just a\nguide. I accept who I am and will do my best.\nI also found myself frustrated with a supplier who repeatedly made the same mistake. Attempts to\nexplain were met with refusal, leading to monthly errors. I realized my energy is stronger now, and I questioned whether I could change\nher or if a different approach would yield better results. I need to use the right energy to communicate with her.\nI felt paralyzed when I realized I only had a week to submit my exercises. While I made progress this month—preparing the PR early, the\nSource Code in the middle, and the Angelica Yantra at the beginning—leaving me with less work, I was still exhausted this week. To\ncounter this, I dedicated one evening to meditation and relaxation, simply lying down without doing anything. I understand this\nexhaustion is an accumulation of memories, and I am learning to transform them.\nI would like to analyze this dream:\n(https://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/system/file\ns/styles/original_with_autorotate/\nprivate/dreams/1874/modern-\nuni-full-colour.jpg?itok=Joq3es0p)\nDuyen Dam (/fr/users/duyen-dam)\n\ue675 (/fr/dream-journal/1874)\ue612 (/fr/assignments/1874)\n\ue654 (/fr/user/1874/myresults)\ue938 (/fr/meditations/1874)\n\ue65eStudent,\nCorrector\nL1 - English pr…\n\ue613\n\ue916\ue915\ue914\n\ue69f\n\ue626100% (9/9) …\n\ue6b2\nÂn Nguyễn, Danièle Kremer\nSymbols\nThe large campus\n-\na nap\n-\nthe right building\n-\nfemale manager\n-\nthe other male manager\n-\nNgan\n-\nfood court\n-\nlightning\n-\n(/fr/users/duyen-dam#profile-main)\n21/08/2025, 09:42\nRestructure | IRSS Portal - Mikaël Universe/City\nhttps://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/node/133223\n1/3\nThe large campus featured a study area and a residential zone, divided by a stream. I ARRIVED early, hoping to rent a temporary room\nfor a nap\nHowever, upon entering the right building , I found every room occupied. I spoke with the female manager , alongside two other girls,\nalso seeking accommodation. She informed me that rooms were only rented monthly and that this was the male section. She then led\nthe two girls to the female area across the way. I sensed her discomfort with my presence, but thankfully, one of the girls pulled me\nalong.\nOn the other side, the other male manager said something like There were no rooms available. I saw Ngan there, though she seemed\nunfamiliar. Then I left.\nI stopped by the food court and ran into several old friends, both male and female, whom I hadn\'t seen in a while. They were enjoying\nthemselves at the counter, picking out food, chatting before heading off.\nI was in another scene, like in a class, and there was a reaction related to lightning .\nI recently had a dream where I was driving my ex-boyfriend to his company, making a right turn. It felt like a stark reminder that I\'m\nrepeating old patterns. I spoke to him that he should be the one driving me.\nThis dream makes me think about how recently I am trying to make myself in work, I have a fear that if I do not do anything, I will be like a\ndie, I will go down, I will not develop. So even when I want to watch something, I use the English video to help me learn it and become\nfamiliar with it. I think I can give myself a little time for breaking to breathe and doing the mantra. Relaxing in the right way is a good thing\nfor my evolution.\nWhen I think about the symbol of my boyfriend in my dream, I realize that he is a part of me and he spends most of his time working.\nEven when his work is over, he can cut all of his time to just work and some basic activities for a long time. He just spent a little time on\nour relationship after he arranged for his sport, his party with his colleagues. I accept that he needs to relax when he works a lot like that.\nBut his balance is not easy, even though he rarely calls his family. He thinks that he should earn money for the future of my parents, but\nwhen he comes back to his home with his family, he spends most of the time gathering and drinking beer. His mother told me that he did\nnot share anything."\nThis dream resonated with something I learned from a video about a book, which described a teacher asking four-year-old students if\nthey wanted to repeat the same lesson or try something new. A portion of them chose the familiar option, and I realized I have a similar\ntendency to stick with what\'s comfortable, indicating a difficulty in embracing new challenges to learn step by step.\nThank you', 'state_of_mind': None, 'notes': 'From PDF: 106.

The car dropped that person off first, then her and her son.\nAfter I got back and we continued hanging out, I suddenly remembered I had a meeting at 2 PM that I\'d completely forgotten about. A\nfriend even messaged me asking why I wasn\'t online. I thought to myself, if I\'d remembered, I wouldn\'t have been goofing around like\nthis.\nThen I noticed the bedroom had a display box on the wall filled with butterflies and other winged insects I\'d forgotten to clean it out.\nBefore I could even touch it, they all flew out.\n(https://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/system/file\ns/styles/original_with_autorotate/\nprivate/dreams/1874/7d9e8459a2\n051c7b34f5421beccf70f3.jpg?\nitok=ulQA2i47)\nDuyen Dam (/fr/users/duyen-dam)\n\ue675 (/fr/dream-journal/1874)\ue612 (/fr/assignments/1874)\n\ue654 (/fr/user/1874/myresults)\ue938 (/fr/meditations/1874)\n\ue65eStudent,\nCorrector\nL1 - English pr…\n\ue613\n\ue916\ue915\ue914\n\ue69f\n\ue626100% (9/9) …\n\ue6b2\nÂn Nguyễn, Danièle Kremer\nSymbols\nGod\n-\nher second son\n-\nleave\n-\nconvenience store\n-\na large car seat\n-\na meeting\n-\n2 PM\n-\na display box\n-\nbutterflies\nand\nother\nwinged insects\n-\n(/fr/users/duyen-dam#profile-main)\n21/08/2025, 09:43\nA Box of Butterflies | IRSS Portal - Mikaël Universe/City\nhttps://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/node/133584\n1/2\nThis week, I\'ve been reflecting on my struggle with sharing and having deep conversations, one of my ex-boyfriend symbol\'s distortions\nthat I had a resonance with. Diving deeper, I realized a root cause lies in my childhood: during a conflict with my brother, my mom told\nme to "keep silent, don\'t say anything." This left me crying uncontrollably, trying to make no sound. This experience created a shadow,\nleading me to withhold problems from my parents, even in the abuse cases I\'ve mentioned. To this day, they remain unaware of what\nhappened to me. This has formed a blocking within me, preventing me from sharing any feelings. Additionally, I\'m now more prone to\nrealizing my own actions, sometimes fearing that current issues, if repeated, could create similar future blockages.\nAdditionally, I\'ve felt itchy and my nose has been stiff ever since hearing about a dream of a man\'s infidelity. I find that it comes from my\nresonances when I do not follow my principles. I also need to work on it.\nTHANK YOU', 'state_of_mind': None, 'notes': 'From PDF: 107. DL_A Box of Butterflies _ 2025'}

When I found that , I quickly tried to find something\nto cover.\n- I am standing on a small object floating on a large water\nLast week, my boyfriend and I went to a wedding of my best friends. Two of my best girl friends asked my boyfriend about the time we\nwill marry. I heard from them one of the reason is that my boyfriend is following many goals in his life but I never heard from him or\nasked him about it. Is there a point I need to improve? Out of the confirmation from the Universe, what do I need to do for my couple, for\nmy boyfriend and for myself? I don\'t understand him enough. I am not sure I take care of him enough. I also have a thought many times\nto reject our relationship. Sometimes, I want to be married, sometimes I don\'t want it. Why do I need to be married? Sister Vandana, what\nis the right thing?

My boyfriend had\ntold me that he had made a decision for our relationship but he needed more time to inform me\nofficially. Last weekend, I shared my feelings and thoughts with my boyfriend. I asked him his\nemotions and opinions realted to marriage. I talked a lot about my negative thoughts, bad feelings,\npressures, some intentions in marriage and raising a child...\nHe listened to my sharing. I reasked\nhis opinion. He required me to ask him yes-no questions instead of what, how, why questions Then, I\nasked him if we were married? If we will get married in September as per Lunar calendar?. He said\nyes and he let me know that his house in his hometown is being fixed. His family will come to my\nhome early. I am a little happy but a big worry because I have not received the answer from Up\nAbove for our relationship.\nObserving myself and receiving some advice from a DSSI friend, I realized I gave myself many reasons to avoid marriage\n- My wrong intention is perfection so I do not accept mistakes, learn from them. The friend reminded me of my intention on a new\njourney. I do not follow to be a better person.

I\nwould like to share my dream interpretation this week.\nMy mother and I came to check-in at a luxury beautiful hotel . Firstly, we were in line with a\ncrowd attending an event of Pros. Kaya and Pros. Christian to take hotel slippers Everyone I\nmet were easily angry . I saw two pairs of pink slippers in the basket; I took one slipper and\nanother from a person. I suddenly recognized and apologized him but he was so angry to accept . He\ntook a slipper without retaking. Some girls were noisy so I lost my attention. I needed to take a\npaper for check-in. My mother and I went along the corridor to our room, we could see all beds in\nall rooms there. Their walls were like a door to go through. A woman staff stood in the middle of the\ncorridor to test and she asked me. I answered rightly so she let my mother and I go through. Two\nold friends helped us bring our luggage to our room\nI said something made my mother angry.\nShe moved to the hotel lobby. The friends and I asked the reason but she kept silent and found\nsomething until my aunt appeared. She was angry and left.\nI am practicing to recognize myself three positive things and one improved thing every day. It is not\neasy for me. It also makes me less hard to others, now I still rarely appreciate or give compliment to\nother people who do the good things.

I am so glad when I can remember the\nbelow dream a lot. I also discovered some memories causing me trouble in my relationship. Firstly, I\nwould like to share my dream as below:\nI drove a motorbike with my female younger cousin to visit a beach in my hometown .\nI couldn't see clearly but I still tried to move.\nMy cousin and I talked a lot about her trip with her parents before they came to my home.\nThen, we met two of my male friends - Ngoc and Hoang They also drove a motorbike. We greeted each other and talked, then we\ncontinued our way. I thought too much, my sharing and my action is not enough so there is a discrepancy\nMy cousin and I came to a place where her sister slept in an object on the beach. We woke her up.\nThese days, I continue working with the angle on the intention of my boyfriend. We must be fit at 4 levels - spiritual, lectual, emotions and\nphysical. For me, they are still general. Could you explain to me in detail?\n(https://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/system/file\ns/styles/original_with_autorotate/\nprivate/dreams/1874/3205835.jpg\n?itok=U47jAzOP)\nDuyen Dam (/fr/users/duyen-dam)\n\ue675 (/fr/dream-journal/1874)\ue612 (/fr/assignments/1874)\n\ue654 (/fr/user/1874/myresults)\ue938 (/fr/meditations/1874)\n\ue65eStudent,\nCorrector\nL1 - English pr…\n\ue613\n\ue916\ue915\ue914\n\ue69f\n\ue626100% (9/9) …\n\ue6b2\nÂn Nguyễn, Danièle Kremer\nSymbols\na motorbike\n-\nmy female younger cousin\n-\na beach\n-\nmy hometown\n-\ntwo of my male friends\n-\nNgoc\n+\nHoang\n+\n(/fr/users/duyen-dam#profile-main)\n20/08/2025, 10:56\nSea | IRSS Portal - Mikaël Universe/City\nhttps://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/node/101170\n1/2\nI also shared developing qualities, my learning DSSI, some things I learned from DSSI with my boyfriend. I asked him his opinion, he still\nwants to marry me. I saw I didn't pay enough attention to him. He has good actions but I do not say anything, do not encourage, do not\nrecord. I focus more on his wrong actions. I let my negative memories affect me a lot. I used to let my thoughts take control and this time,\nI am studying and doing a way to let them go, to give myself and my boyfriend better taking care. .\nMy boyfriend and I make love. My thought is always that he just wants my body when he does not take care of me enough I am scared to\nface it if it becomes true. The thought came to nature and last night, when it came, I observed it and understood it is one of the reasons\nwhy I do not believe him fully, I did not record his other good actions, his personality.

I am asking the Up Above "is my boyfriend the right person for me in\nthis life?". Is it right to ask too much one question?\nI use a masculine wooden ruler fly with my female friend . It was like a broomstick We went\nthrough a forest to somewhere. THEN I lost her so I came back to find my friend.\nThe dream shows me the uncomfortable part I am trying to avoid doing that. It causes myself the\ninside too much thought, too much emotion. As I shared I thought negatively too much, I used to force myself to do something instead of\nanalyzing the meaning of my thoughts. It was a wrong way because it is still there without fixing. In meditation, I can focus on one\nthought and find the memories causing that to fix.\nI have not met my friend in a long time. She used to be one of my best friends. We spent our time in our childhood. Once, she and\nanother friend misunderstood each other. I knew the reason so I explained the story to the friend to help them fix their relationship. My\nfriend knew that so she thought I was a talkative, unreliable friend and she did not want to meet me anymore. Although I apologized to\nher, she did not accept. We didn\'t meet anymore from that.\nMy parents have just called me and asked me an option for my relationship. My family want us to organize a pre-wedding party at my\nhome on the day a feng shui master told for our couple. I have not received the answer from the Up Above so I do not follow that fully.

At the end of last week, after setting up basically the coffee\nstore all day, I felt tired, exhausted and terrible. I would like to stop working. When I shared my\nfeelings and my work with my mother, she told me this was a job I chose and I was silly choosing\nthat. The job does not belong to my major. Besides, some old colleagues also told me the job is more\nsimple than my ability. I also felt alone when I could not share with anyone. I reminded myself the\npurpose of working is developing quality. My feelings at that time were so strong. I cried a lot. I shared them with my boyfriend and he\nencouraged me to continue because the job will let me study how to manage a store, staffs. I hugged myself softly.\nThe next day I continued working in my tired body. My mind still had a thought about quitting the job. It lasted two days then I became\nmore comfortable. I have not found the memories causing that.\nLast night, I got a dream as below\nI was on the way to my grandfather's house . Then I drove around an area two times .

I usually arrange my schedule to spend my time with him rather than with\nmy friend or myself. He schedules and spends his time playing football, having parties with his\ncolleagues, his friends. I asked myself what kind of our relationship is, what our common things are.\nSometimes, we walk in a park, visit his relatives but our topic is so limited. Besides, he has never discussed our future plans. Sometimes I\nasked him about our marriage. He told me he needed more time. I do not know whether I should talk about this topic because I have not\nreceived the guide from Up Above so I avoided mentioning it. This week, Prof Kaya will decode dreams via zoom. I had an opportunity to\njoin with 2 friends. But I have not shown my invitation to my boyfriend. I hope that we can share the same topic related to symbolic\nlanguage with the life purpose of developing qualities. Going to within, I am scared to be alone. It is one of the reasons why I do not want\nto lose him.\nThis week, my work is not easy. My staff for the coffee store are sick and I spend most of my time working in the coffee store. I found\nmore staff to expand the business but I have not found out. I should develop the business but it is not easy. I want to give up. I give\nmyself the reason related to spiritual way.

The contents were not good, the characters fell in love and had sexuality too\nfast or they had sexuality without love. I slept around 11:45 p.m. and woke up around 3 am. I was\naffected by two films. I did not make a good choice for my soul.\nI would like to share a dream for this week. This dream appeared when I watched the Good Doctors\non Netflix\nAfter school, I went to the library where Dr. Glassman is a bookkeeper. I was looking for my name in a newspaper . I also felt that I\nalmost found that. But I have not seen it. Some friends had the same purpose as me. Then a person, Hoang , found the newspaper\nhaving his name. We finding continued over lunch. Dr. Glassman went to take the lunch and reminded us of having lunch. I still paid\nattention to finding it in anger because I nearly had it. I would do it quickly to come home and my mother would not be angry with me.\nAfter looking for a long time, I felt hungry so I stopped to eat. I came out and met Dr. Glassman came back, I also saw our school was\npreparing for the final meeting. I saw many teachers were walking. One of them was Nhan , a homeroom teacher. He was coming back to\nthe room for homeroom teachers. I remembered I have not completed the exercises from Dr. Glassman. He gave them to me at the end\nof this morning. I continued looking for the newspaper. I brought high newspapers on a window to check but nothing. I realized the\nexercises are more important than looking.\n(https://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/system/file\ns/styles/original_with_autorotate/\nprivate/dreams/1874/the_good_d\noctor.jpg?itok=ZGv9ogWr)\nDuyen Dam (/fr/users/duyen-dam)\n\ue675 (/fr/dream-journal/1874)\ue612 (/fr/assignments/1874)\n\ue654 (/fr/user/1874/myresults)\ue938 (/fr/meditations/1874)\n\ue65eStudent,\nCorrector\nL1 - English pr…\n\ue613\n\ue916\ue915\ue914\n\ue69f\n\ue626100% (9/9) …\n\ue6b2\nÂn Nguyễn, Danièle Kremer\nSymbols\nlibrary\n-\nDr. Glassman\n-\nnewspaper\n-\nHoang\n-\nNhan\n-\nexercises\n-\n(/fr/users/duyen-dam#profile-main)\n19/08/2025, 22:00\nThe Newspaper having my name | IRSS Portal - Univers/Cité Mikaël\nhttps://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/node/93018\n1/2\nThank you for being here', 'state_of_mind': None, 'notes': 'From PDF: 4.

I thought I need to ask and listen to him fully. I learn to be patient, not compare, and let him\nfeel free to share his opinion, right? I asked him how he felt at this period of time. He took a lot of\ntime to say what he thought. He said his mind has been confused about our relationship from the\ntime when his family visited my family in 2021 and we have been in a couple since 2018. This meeting happened from his parents' plan,\nnot from him and at that time he did not have enough courage to exchange his opinion with his family. From that time, every time, he\nputs me, he has pressure, and over time, his feeling decreases for me. Until now, he does not know what he should do with me, continue\nor not. I also do not know what I can do for myself and for him. Why do we fall into this situation? What should I do for myself and for\nhim? The couple is not depending on feelings , it should include physical level, emotion level, thought level, and spiritual level. I used to think\nabout how we can have the best emotions, and look forward to making them... It limits the way we experience when we just think and focus on\nthe emotional level.

{'case_id': 'C01', 'dream_id': 'D0003', 'date': None, 'dream_text': "Dear Prof Anthony and Dr Mayur,\nI am okay at this time. I learned a lot in this seminar. It is an opportunity to apply the Law of\nResonance for my relationship. A part of myself prevented me from accepting this is my fault. I open\nanother view. Sometimes I try to please someone to get love. To a point, I felt too lost, empty so I\nasked myself who I was. There was a discrepancy between my inner world and my outer world.\nI feel very touched after reading your revision this week. It encouraged me to continue working. I\nsaw a part of my resistance. It does not want to change, to step. I asked myself what the thing I wanted to do. It is the way I must step but\nI am scared to step. I am not sure I can commit to do it or not. I am scared that one time I will run away, I will compromise. I thought I\nused to do it. I compromised many times and I got karmas so the light is clear and I need to step although my negative parts are there to\nkeep me. These days, I got dreams every night, and I practiced mantras every time I have time. I saw an important thing it is the way I sing\nfor myself. In the previous sometimes my way is not polite, not sacred. I change the way I sing, I would like to give the best voice with the\nsoftness for my soul. It is so blessed, so beautiful. The mantra helps me calm through the feelings alone, emotional dependencies, and\nemotional difficulties when my negative thoughts appear.\nFirstly, when I put a tax officer. I was scared because it is related to justice, sometimes I felt difficult every time it was related to\ngovernment. This time, I just felt a little bit scared and everything is okay, he guided me clearly on what I should do. It can be easy to ask\nabout my concerns.\n(https://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/system/file\ns/styles/original_with_autorotate/\nprivate/dreams/1874/how-to-\nmake-vegetable-soup-recipes-\nkids-should-know-side-horz-jane-\nmaynard-alpha-mom-web.jpg?\nitok=YEqEGEQG)\nDuyen Dam (/fr/users/duyen-dam)\n\ue675 (/fr/dream-journal/1874)\ue612 (/fr/assignments/1874)\n\ue654 (/fr/user/1874/myresults)\ue938 (/fr/meditations/1874)\n\ue65eStudent,\nCorrector\nL1 - English pr…\n\ue613\n\ue916\ue915\ue914\n\ue69f\n\ue626100% (9/9) …\n\ue6b2\nÂn Nguyễn, Danièle Kremer\nSymbols\nclass\n-\n,\nY\n-\n(/fr/users/duyen-dam#profile-main)\n20/08/2025, 15:33\nSeparating class | IRSS Portal - Mikaël University/City\nhttps://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/node/111438\n1/2\nSecondly, today I just realize the love I received. As I shared, sometimes I felt disconnected. I can't feel the love for me. This morning, my\nboyfriend's sister contacted me to give me a present from my boyfriend's mother. I was confused if it is right to receive it at this time. I\nfeel it is okay, it is a gift and I receive it with my appreciation. I called to my mother and talked about my niece and some normal stories.\nSometimes I felt a little bit uncomfortable when my mom talked something. Then I spent one hour to talk with my boyfriend's mother\nabout her gift, her life, ... naturally. After these two conversations, I felt a stranger feeling. I remembered the questions my mom asked\nme about the food, my difficulty, ... I feel so appreciated. I feel the love from my mother when I am far from my family. I feel the love from\nmy boyfriend's mother. She told me the stories, and answered my questions. She also shared her health, her work naturally. Calling is\none of the ways to show our love, our care. One more time, it helps me realize she represents my boyfriend's inner world, it always has\npluses and minuses. My relationship is an experiment for us to learn and to do the right things.\nSometimes, I felt difficult to deal with my negative thought. But I remember a guide from Prof Kaya in this seminar. Life is always a\nchallenge. I am studying the way to give unconditional love with wisdom.\nI would like to analyze this dream as below:\nSeparating class , Y and I studied with another female teacher about civic education. In the beginning, the teacher sat between I and Y at\nthe round table. We joined the test. Y sat at the table beside the door, the teacher and I sat at the table opposite that table, between two\ntables was a wall. The test was the list of dishes. I arranged the order suitably. The principal appears with a friend. They sat on my right\nside. The principal asked me and watched me the way I cooked. When I looked at my notebook, I discovered my notebook was cluttered\nwith paper shortages and I noted other subjects on that. I feel embarrassed for the principal. I remembered the third dish I chose was a\nkind of soup. My teacher must give me the material because it was very special.\nThis week, I analyzed my dream almost finished but it happens a mistake when I try to save it. It is a reminder for me to be planned for\nthe next time better. This dream is related to the right authority. When I let the positions and the ages affect me the way I communicate\nand act with others. I should respect everyone in terms of soul.\nThank you", 'state_of_mind': None, 'notes': 'From PDF: 47.

I work concentrated but when I returned home, I felt tired and\nlet myself watch short videos related to anime and cartoons. My feeling changes sometimes up\nsometimes down. My boyfriend still keeps silent after my message to exchange. I call him but he is\nbusy with a party so I will call back later. This week, my mother asked me about my couple's status. I\nsaid it broke. She gently encouraged me to live freely.\nAnother point I discovered was my anger. When I worked with Angel Aniel related to breaking the old\npattern. I repeat a pattern . When someone did not agree with my work, I quickly became angry to\nshow up my abilities and my other's wrong points. I have a tendency to find weak proof from others to force them to follow my point\nwithout listening fully although maybe their opinion is not suitable at this time but their intention is good.\nIn the first story, I spent a lot of time making a file shortly, precisely but another colleague does not believe my data, so he tries to reject\nit. My manager also talked to me that if I am more receptive, he will let me support the customers more. Sometimes, the customer will\nnot be satisfied and has some bad words but I should learn to deal with it politely.\nIn the second story, my older brother called me about checking out a famous hospital for my father. It is the first time my father accepts\ngoing to check his health condition at a hospital in HCM city (now they are in my hometown far from HCM city around 600km). My father\ndoes not want to check because It will let him know his health status. My brother wants to choose the best hospital and do all the tests\n(https://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/system/file\ns/styles/original_with_autorotate/\nprivate/dreams/1874/this_week.jp\neg?itok=kwdM-MDC)\nDuyen Dam (/fr/users/duyen-dam)\n\ue675 (/fr/dream-journal/1874)\ue612 (/fr/assignments/1874)\n\ue654 (/fr/user/1874/myresults)\ue938 (/fr/meditations/1874)\n\ue65eStudent,\nCorrector\nL1 - English pr…\n\ue613\n\ue916\ue915\ue914\n\ue69f\n\ue626100% (9/9) …\n\ue6b2\nÂn Nguyễn, Danièle Kremer\nSymbols\nthe gate key\n-\ntwo\n-\nMy boyfriend\n-\nmy mother\nHoang\n-\n(/fr/users/duyen-dam#profile-main)\n20/08/2025, 15:33\nMy anger | IRSS Portal - Mikaël Universe/City\nhttps://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/node/112033\n1/2\nincluding gastroscopy although my father does not have pain in the stomach. I use our financial condition and the hurt in gastroscopy to\nreject his idea. My brother shouted at me. He said I only ignore his ideas for many reasons. I felt angry too and I do not want to continue\nour call. I observe my intensity. I keep silent for a minute, I see my resistance then I note his opinion. I told him I would do the things and\nreplied to him later. We talked like that many times in a long time. Every time, he puts his opinion on others, he becomes too sensitive, he\ndid not want to listen to others and he thought he understood this matter more clearly. I also have this like him. Esp when he is my\nbrother. I do not like that, I used to become gentle with him in that case but it was a facade. Inside me, I still think I was right and he was\nwrong. I repressed my feelings and my thoughts until I didn't keep them inside anymore. When it was a facade it did not solve the matter.\nMy brother triggered me many negative thoughts every time I met him. I see myself I have a tendency to avoid him . This lesson is very\nimportant and I should do it soon.\nIn the third story, my roommate kept the gate key for almost a month since our owner gave her . When I asked her to give it to me\nbecause I need to go out in the early morning. She gave me two keys and said she could not remember what is the right key. I asked her\nto check and give me the right key. But she rejected it. I felt angry without understanding her case. And she ignored me and didn't say\nanything.\nThese cases make me feel tired, hard and do not want to do anymore. I realized the Up Above brings them to teach me, to stop me\nnourishing my anger. It took a lot of energy and the aura was terrible. I practice a lesson. I imagined each above story and I changed the\nway of talking from my brother, my roommate, and mine around these matters to gentle and right before sleeping. I understand they are\nparts of me, and I am improving my communication. Do I understand right? These days, my stomach does not feel good. I felt a little bit\nuncomfortable. The stomach is related to my feeling centers, I have difficulty digesting and nourishing my feelings .\nI would like to analyze this dream:\nMy boyfriend , my mother and I were on the way. I saw Hoang . So I called him, my mother became angry but I argued with her.\nThank you", 'state_of_mind': None, 'notes': 'From PDF: 48. DL_My anger _ 2023'}

Life is so short and I must save my time.\nSometimes I make the decision in a hurry. If I didn't do it, I would regret it in the future. It is not right\nwhen we are a soul. We must follow the natural movement under developing the qualities. It is also\nan aspect of patience.\nI would like to share with you some good news. I met my boyfriend and we had a beautiful meeting. I\nalmost felt soft and comfortable. I shared my feelings, and my intentions for my couple: developing qualities with 3 options (continue with\nthe right intentions, pause in one month and stop our relationship). He had difficulty making decisions. I was patient to let him think, give\nhim the plus and the minus of each option, and share what I have learned from UCM in the three years since I knew UCM and the way of\nmaking decisions under developing qualities. He did it. He chooses option 3, stopping our relationship. I respected his choice. I felt sad\nbut the process of sharing gives me the courage to continue to advance. The pain is still there. I discovered some new parts of myself:\nsome patterns in love, and some wrong intentions in owning a person, ...When I observed my miss of my boyfriend, I thought a part of it\ncame from my possession , my instinctual needs.\nI love the knowledge from UCM but I see my resistance. How could I work it rightly?\nThis week I would like to analyze this dream as below:\n(https://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/system/file\ns/styles/original_with_autorotate/\nprivate/dreams/1874/polynesian2\n52b1619.png?itok=hezAGVJU)\nDuyen Dam (/fr/users/duyen-dam)\n\ue675 (/fr/dream-journal/1874)\ue612 (/fr/assignments/1874)\n\ue654 (/fr/user/1874/myresults)\ue938 (/fr/meditations/1874)\n\ue65eStudent,\nCorrector\nL1 - English pr…\n\ue613\n\ue916\ue915\ue914\n\ue69f\n\ue626100% (9/9) …\n\ue6b2\nÂn Nguyễn, Danièle Kremer\nSymbols\na party\n-\nmy aunt\n-\na beautiful house\n-\n(/fr/users/duyen-dam#profile-main)\n20/08/2025, 15:34\nA movement | IRSS Portal - Mikaël Universe/City\nhttps://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/node/112320\n1/2\nI joined a party with my aunt 's friends and some of my uncles at a beautiful house , which was made from bamboo and raised on stilts\nover the surface of the soil. The party was done in the middle of the house. The front of the house is a beautiful lobby. People sit in a\nlong line, female, male, and then female. I sat at the end of the line.\nSitting a little bit, I went to the front to take photos of my aunt and nephew. But I couldn't take a beautiful photo. I took a rest.\nIt rained. The ceiling was not sealed. Some friends started leaving. My aunt, uncle, and some nephews sat in a great place to take photos.\nThose friends needed to take shoes at the place I took photos so I was reminded to go out. But the photos were not beautiful so we\nstopped.\nOne of those friends lost the vehicle card. Thanh Linh gave his card to the friend. My boyfriend was also at the party but in the beginning,\nhe was so strange to me. Until now he reminded me Thanh Linh used to help me like this. Although at that time, his help was not\nsuccessful, I did not remind. Then I leave but I still want him to keep me back but he was still strange to me.\nI heard from 2 men why the owner did not let the bank rent this place because the owner must rent the guard but letting the bank rent\nwill get more money.\nThank you", 'state_of_mind': None, 'notes': 'From PDF: 49.

Then we agreed to buy and we ate there.\nMy father suddenly wanted to\ngamble with the lotteries of the vendor. He lost. When everything becomes difficult, I will just do a new\nthing with a hope of luck and lack of going deeply to clean the negative memories. After eating, my\nfather and I left the waste for the vendor We also received a reminder of cleaning from a female\nguard standing far from us but we still continued. The vendor did not clean and left.\nMy mother and I went to a cinema by motorbike. Inside of me, I continue comparing myself with\nothers. An old girlfriend appeared and went with us. My ex-boyfriend wanted to meet me but I\nrejected and he followed us . My mother and I left our motorbike at a parking lot and walked to the cinema. The cinema was crowded.\nThere were many people walking too. The old girlfriend told me a story about my ex-boyfriend. When I was taken to a country, he\nbetrayed this country to take me back . My mother and I saw a crowd. I saw my boyfriend fixing his motorbike with my brother. The\nmotorbike has a chain trouble. He tried to watch the movie with us. Two girl strangers told me his other problem - crossing the red\nlight and getting punished. I was angry because he didn't tell me. Before bringing his motorbike to be fixed, he and I came to the cinema\n(https://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/system/file\ns/styles/original_with_autorotate/\nprivate/dreams/1874/cinema.jpg?\nitok=0JoLs9_j)\nDuyen Dam (/fr/users/duyen-dam)\n\ue675 (/fr/dream-journal/1874)\ue612 (/fr/assignments/1874)\n\ue654 (/fr/user/1874/myresults)\ue938 (/fr/meditations/1874)\n\ue65eStudent,\nCorrector\nL1 - English pr…\n\ue613\n\ue916\ue915\ue914\n\ue69f\n\ue626100% (9/9) …\n\ue6b2\nÂn Nguyễn, Danièle Kremer\nSymbols\nMy father\n-\na cinema\n-\nparking lot\n-\ntwo female street vendors\n-\nlotteries\n-\nMy mother\n-\nMy ex-boyfriend\n-\nmotorcycle\n-\nTwo girl strangers\n-\n30\n-\n(/fr/users/duyen-dam#profile-main)\n19/08/2025, 22:01\nVisiting a cinema | Portail IRSS - Univers/Cité Mikaël\nhttps://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/node/93576\n1/2\nto buy a ticket for him.

He got some damage but they are not significant. But his left shoulder was not good,\nhis hand could not lift up. He took an X-ray scan but his bones are okay, Now he should follow it in a\nperiod of time.\nI watched the course "The Birth of a Dream" by Prof Kasara. It is so touching, profound, and\ninspiring. It is very very beautiful. Prof Anthony and Prof Kasara are joining the project in equilibrium.\nI asked myself why I miss my relationship and still hope when we are not balancing and mixing many\nthings. I continue to work on my memories to be myself within and outside.\nMy family has a problem related to my brother\'s couple. He does not share or give money to his wife\nesp when they have just had a baby. It is an accumulated matter for a long time since they married.\nTheir marriage and their having a child are a push from family so it is not right in their attitude. His wife does not respect him. It is a\nlesson to let them learn. I also need to cleanse my memories related to that. Next, my brother found compensation from outside by\ntalking to a woman. It is not the right way to solve a problem. How do I use money rightly at my personal, couple, and family level? When\nwe move to a higher level, we must manage money in the right way. Maybe two members should give 50/50 or 40/60... to a common\naccount and arrange it clearly.\n(https://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/system/file\ns/styles/original_with_autorotate/\nprivate/dreams/1874/window.jpe\ng?itok=UUeDZqyQ)\nDuyen Dam (/fr/users/duyen-dam)\n\ue675 (/fr/dream-journal/1874)\ue612 (/fr/assignments/1874)\n\ue654 (/fr/user/1874/myresults)\ue938 (/fr/meditations/1874)\n\ue65eStudent,\nCorrector\nL1 - English pr…\n\ue613\n\ue916\ue915\ue914\n\ue69f\n\ue626100% (9/9) …\n\ue6b2\nÂn Nguyễn, Danièle Kremer\nSymbols\nQuang\n-\nthe Philippines\n-\na drink\n-\ntable\n-\nOanh\n-\nparking\n-\na rented house\n-\nwindow\n-\nnotebook\n-\nkissed\n-\n(/fr/users/duyen-dam#profile-main)\n20/08/2025, 15:35\nA break | IRSS Portal - Mikaël Universe/City\nhttps://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/node/112728\n1/2\nOne day, I asked myself what next after our relationship\'s status. I felt scared to face the truth. When my friend asks me about our\nrelationship, I am not ready to share it. I saw myself keeping hope to come back. That night, I received two dreams as below:\n1. Quang returned home from the Philippines . He invited my friends, me and my ex-boyfriend) to meet for a drink .\nI sat at a table near their table. I needed to complete a task before meeting them.\nI missed my task a little bit. When I lack concentration, my task could take more time to complete and I just want to complete it quickly. My\nintention and the process are very important. When I completed my task, they were ready to leave the party after sitting overnight. I saw\nOanh \'s face was very wet. A difficulty to transform emotions in the right way when I have a facade and expectations.\nI stood at the parking at a distance from them. I only met Quang. I explained the reason why I could not join and my relationship\'s status\nbecause my ex-boyfriend was also in the party. He sympathized with my story.\n2. The second dream I received after noting the first dream, most of the characters are strange.\nSome friends and I were in a rented house .\nThat night, two girls were very noisy for a matter. One of the two girls must pick up her mother and boss at the airport.\nMy ex-boyfriend, the other girl, and I sat next to the window for talking. Then a couple came. I thought it was a coincidence but the girl\nhad an appointment with them. They left.\nI asked my ex-boyfriend how to use a notebook . I kissed his cheek before I left him to take my notebook while he arranged his\nnotebook. I reminded myself it was not right in my mind. He did not react. When I come back, he guided me on how to use a notebook.\nThank you for your support on this journey.', 'state_of_mind': None, 'notes': 'From PDF: 50. DL_A break _2023'}

During the retreat, I found the family's love again after the\nYana session with a hammock. The broken story became light and it did not affect my feelings, or my\nthoughts anymore. I felt okay, more receptivity, more softness after the Retreat. On the first day at\nmy work after the retreat, my little finger on my left hand was hit by a can while I tried to take an\nobject. My finger has bent with hurt until now. After that, I put some colleagues at the restroom, at\nthe time I came back to my work, I hit the door on my left ankle and my left head.\nI am so touched with the UCM knowledge and I would like to integrate it deeply.\nLast night, I had a call with my ex-boyfriend's mother. We listen and share our stories with each other. . Her knee joints are dry. She\nalso shared that my ex-boyfriend had tonsillitis in the hospital. She felt sad when he didn't connect to her. Her story lets me think\nabout the family relationship. I used to feel okay when I didn't build my relationship with my parents. They lived far from me. We do not\nkeep the connection correctly. Now, I am rebuilding it, reconnecting the origin of the feminine and masculine polarities. I retouched the\nlove from my family. In the retreat, Prof Haritha told me that someone would die if they felt no one needed them and sometimes, a\nperson took his parents for granted that they were always there.

They got the bad things after that.\nSome people are led by their instinctual needs, greed so they do the bad things. Although they get some opportunities to fix their\nmistakes, they do not realize them clearly so they make another mistake.\nThe main character is patient and tries to improve her knowledge.\n-: The main character hurts the people who harmed her in return, she continues her cycle of life instead of ending her cycle.

The fire made the two children's hands\nburn. At this time, Oanh and An were talking together . When she could not find her children in the house, I appointed her the children's\naddress. She drove a pickup truck and saved her children. But a man took his pickup truck. She and her children went out of the\nforest with many people.

I see the dream and the training guiding\nme to take further steps in my life.\nLast weekend, our company had a trip. We played, ate, and studied together. The course we studied\nfrom my boss is about How to give a comment to someone. The principle like the UCM knowledge is\n8 compliments and 2 comments. I thought it was time to apply this principle deeply in my life. She\nstudied a lot from many courses during this period time. She shared with us for example: energy, music affects energy, and developing\nourselves, ... Our team is more connected after sharing their evaluation about three aspects: personal, family, and work, and their wish to\nimprove them. The sharing has minuses and pluses. A minus part of it is related to insecurity, needs, and lack of wisdom ... but it is a\nbeautiful step (tendency). I will have a meeting with my team to apply this knowledge deeply.\nThis week, I completed the story I read. I come back to a normal life with a good schedule. I ask myself why I feel empty after finishing the\nstory. And I will meditate on it deeply and share you to receive your support. A part of it is related to instinctual needs, a need for\nsomeone to love me and give me fidelity, caring, and being aside... It compensates my lack inside of me.\nToday, my roommate invited me to paint a picture following a video. It is a simple picture of the flower in the air. I feel a bit difficult\nbecause it should be the stiff strokes instead of loose, soft strokes. I thought it was like how I give something, sometimes it lacks softness\nand flexibility.\n(https://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/system/file\ns/styles/original_with_autorotate/\nprivate/dreams/1874/istock-\n1152164476.jpg?itok=Z7QbJ3Fl)\nDuyen Dam (/fr/users/duyen-dam)\n\ue675 (/fr/dream-journal/1874)\ue612 (/fr/assignments/1874)\n\ue654 (/fr/user/1874/myresults)\ue938 (/fr/meditations/1874)\n\ue65eStudent,\nCorrector\nL1 - English pr…\n\ue613\n\ue916\ue915\ue914\n\ue69f\n\ue626100% (9/9) …\n\ue6b2\nÂn Nguyễn, Danièle Kremer\nSymbols\nNhi's boarding house\n-\nY\n-\nTrang\n-\n(/fr/users/duyen-dam#profile-main)\n20/08/2025, 15:40\nA cozy mood | IRSS Portal - Mikaël Universe/City\nhttps://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/node/115707\n1/2\nOn my coming home, I see a mother carrying her child in the rain. I remember my mother used to do that when I was a child. It took me\nto another memory. My mom said to me and many people many times that If she did not carry me from kindergarten every afternoon,\nher business would be better. It becomes a negative memory for me. I felt sad when I was a reason for something bad. It lets me see the\ninsecurity of my mother makes her give a wrong notion of love to me. Sometimes, I let my insecurity lead me to take action.\nI would like to analyze this dream as below:\nI was in Nhi's boarding house . I visited and stayed for a day.\nY had just transferred there to live. I found a way to visit Y's bedsit . Her room was comfortable, cool, and beautiful but she was a little bit\nembarrassed when I visited.\nI made an appointment with my high school friends in the room of someone. I arrived early and sat on the mat waiting for everyone. The\nroom was on the 1st floor having two big doors and a window to look at a garden.\nTrang came but she sat at the table with some friends from Math class, most of whom were male. They also had an appointment today.\nThey were surprised when they saw me. I had the intention to let them move to another room because this room was not available for\nthem. But I didn't talk to them because I felt embarrassed.\nThank you", 'state_of_mind': None, 'notes': 'From PDF: 56. DL_A cozy mood _ 2023'}

Because, in our hometown, there is a couple with two children. The man\ndiscovered that the two children were not his. He felt shocked about this. I asked myself what it meant and why my mother had a\nresonance with that, what I should do. My mom and my sister-in-law are not good to each other. They have a lot of conflicts. It is not right\nto hide the truth, infidelity at the point of I received this news. They are learning their lesson. My mother has an insecurity related to\ninfidelity in her memory so she has a resonance like this. These days, my mother has many negative memories. I study how to listen to\nher stories without judging and giving advice. I am not sure she is ready to listen to my point of view. Sometimes, I understand listening\nwithout judging is a way to be more receptive and help others feel comfortable without dramatizing. I hope my mother can be happier\nand happier but she is learning and I should respect her rhythm without forcing. I used to want to fix other relationships. But they come\nto help us learn to be a better person. Besides, I discovered that when I shared knowledge with my brother at the wrong time, it made my\nbrother keep a distance from me. He does not answer my questions when I would like to reconnect after that. I also study a way to build\nthe relationship between me and my brother.\nAt the physical level, my ex-boyfriend's cousin and her husband made an appointment with me. We ate and drank some beer. She asked\nme about my breaking. I told her I and my ex-boyfriend have pluses and minuses. My ex-boyfriend thing to stop, and I have had feelings\nfor him until now. Then my ex-boyfriend appeared. He looked slimmer than before. He had just drunk wine with his colleagues. He has\nstill drunk beers although he is sick - pulmonary tuberculosis as I shared. We talk naturally about some activities with each other. I felt a\nlittle bit uncomfortable at the beginning then peaceful, and happy during this experience. After that, we went to karaoke. During this\nperiod time, I invoked Angel Vasariah in my mind every moment I was alone to let me do the right thing in this situation. I slept at his\ncousin's house. When I slept on the couch, suddenly I felt someone look at me. I opened my eyes and saw my ex-boyfriend looking at me.\nI lost control and asked him how he felt about our relationship now. He said he still has feelings for me. I shared my feelings related to\nsad to him after his decision but I respect his choice. I asked him which option he chose for now. He needed more time and he will\nanswer me later. We hugged each other. I see the difficulty of committing changes in the way we think, feel, and act. I have just received\na dream last night so I would like to share it deeply in the PR 32 Vasariah. I respect it and at this time, our conditions are not suitable for\nmaking a decision.

I am more intellectual than emotional.\nThis week, my workplace in the building had fire alarms due to a position under construction causing dust\non the smoke detector. Some of the people who work together in the building ran out. The others still\nstayed at the same place to call the building management board. Some of them felt angry. In the\nbeginning, I felt guilty for these mistakes. I am working on the building management board but we are not\nprofessional. I also used to think our technical team was not good in these cases. I found the reason why it\nhappens angrily. Then, my colleague also shared her scared after hearing that sound when we had lunch\nand she thought we were not professional when we made the same mistake. At that point, I thought\nagain and said to her that we heard enough complaints from the customers, we would find solutions and we needed more compassion to be\nbetter. I discovered that I was too harsh in this case, and then I felt more receptive and more comfortable when the Up Above gave me the case.\nBesides, our technical team had a meeting to improve the next time.\nI also have a question about how we call the name of a feeling rightly. I am so confused about the emotional states. Sometimes, I use the word\n"Normal" to avoid calling the true feelings. What should I do to this matter?

The\nsurrounding area was peaceful and had a lot of trees with a few houses.\nMy mother wanted to go out so my brother and I took her out. Before we left, the owner informed us that her daughter was sick\nsuddenly so she would take the rooms back earlier.\nWe stopped on the side of the road with a lot of flowers.

My mom drove another bike. They ran fast on the narrow concrete road and\ncontinuously went up and downhill. At a corner, there was a supermarket and we went through it.\nWhen we came to our room, we saw a baby sleeping on the bed with her father. I was informed that the television in the room was\nspecial. So I wanted to know. I opened and closed quickly to not let the baby wake up.\nAt 3:26 am one day, I received a dream. I wanted to write it. So I woke up and I didn't remember this dream. What happened in this case?\nAnd these days I have difficulty remembering and writing down my dreams. What should I do?\nI have a special week when my emotion is too sensitive. I am easy to feel angry. Today, I will have a meeting with my coffee team. It was\nthe first time we met full of members. I will do the best for myself and our team with the first intention of developing qualities.\nBesides, I would like to hear your advice. My ex-boyfriend and I have talked again. He still has a feeling for me, he is still scared. I do not\nwant to repeat the same mistake. I give myself and him 4 months to be a friend. I missed some of my important things when I was not\nbrave enough to show my spiritual path in the period we were a couple.

I spent a Tet Holiday in my\nhometown. This year I became more conscious when I was home. I observed my family and am\nstudying to record my members' pluses. Sometimes, I felt uncomfortable when I saw the wrong thing\nfrom them. I tried to use the Law of Resonance and recite the Mantra, at the beginning, Dabamiah\nbut it was too heavy and dense in my heart so I chanted Dabamiah and Haziel. I am studying to\nrespect the rhythm of my family members. The weight was big. I still had a desire to talk out my\nthoughts when my mother or my father complained about someone or something. Sometimes, I do\nnot want to come back home or I want to live in my home in a short time. My family wants to live in\nlove but we repress things so we do not have a neutral conversation about any topic. When we must\nsay something, it has a lot of emotions esp anger, frustration, and pushing. I have difficulty feeling\nthe love from my family and giving the right love to my family. What should I do to change it?\nOn the 2nd day of the Tet Holiday, the weather became colder with great winds. It is the coldest day in this period. My father had a\nstroke last August. On that day, he trembled and felt so cold. He also got diarrhea . This was the first time I saw him like that. It affects\nme a lot. I felt worried about his health. I reminded myself it was a lesson we needed to have.\nBesides, these days, my right leg was too tired as if I ran a lot.

I also asked\nwhy they did it. I found the solutions from my manager, friends who have businesses like me, the\ninternet ... And I was confused about "What should I do to the story? Do I need to find out the\ncheater? Do I only need to change the process instead of going into the problem? ...". Just a small\nproblem, it activates more and more insecurity and fears of communication.\nI chose to work with Angel Lecabel. I want to share with you my story of this week. On one of my mornings, I had a dream:\nI met Thoa .\nShe ạchieved something. I congratulated her when she was sitting in the back seat of the car and leaving.\nThat evening, at the physical level, I arranged a date with my friend who manages two tea-milk stores to ask about her experiences at\none of her stores.\nThat night, she was too busy. Sometimes, she was with her store, sometimes, she was with her friend, and sometimes, she was with me.\n(https://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/system/file\ns/styles/original_with_autorotate/\nprivate/dreams/1874/ginger-milk-\ntea_1.jpg?itok=A3Jz49el)\nDuyen Dam (/fr/users/duyen-dam)\n\ue675 (/fr/dream-journal/1874)\ue612 (/fr/assignments/1874)\n\ue654 (/fr/user/1874/myresults)\ue938 (/fr/meditations/1874)\n\ue65eStudent,\nCorrector\nL1 - English pr…\n\ue613\n\ue916\ue915\ue914\n\ue69f\n\ue626100% (9/9) …\n\ue6b2\nÂn Nguyễn, Danièle Kremer\nSymbols\nThoa\n-\nback seat of the car\n-\nmy friend\n-\ntwo tea-milk stores\n-\n(/fr/users/duyen-dam#profile-main)\n20/08/2025, 16:05\nAn intense week when I go out too much | IRSS Portal - Univers/Cité Mikaël\nhttps://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/node/120399\n1/2\nAt the end of the evening, she spent two hours sharing and helping me with my problems to work with my team. But I wanted to leave\nbecause I wanted to come home and go to the restroom. Because of her enthusiastic sharing, I delayed my needs.\nWhen I left her store, it was too late. When I came home from her place to my house, I got lost and ran around.\nI lost sleep . I became too hyperactive and wanted to make changes to the coffee shop immediately. I invoked Lecabel to be more patient.\nWhen I become hyperactive, too-down-to-earth, I want to solve any problem as soon as possible => lack respect for the rhythm, and be preserved\nwith wisdom - the Law of Resonance and Evil is educational.\nThen the next day, I was too tired and forced the coffee business and my team to some new rules and processes with negative emotions.\nI projected on my team and created a bad atmosphere in the coffee store. I continued losing sleep. My nose could not breathe normally,\nand I felt uncomfortable on the left, and then in the middle of the night, my discomfort from left to right.\nNow I understand why I got sick now, I am calm to rectify my negative memories. These stories are the same as your advice I need to step\nby step but it must begin from within with the right intention - developing qualities.\nThank you', 'state_of_mind': None, 'notes': 'From PDF: 69.

I mostly forgot the important aspect of\nthat dream.\nI would like to analyze a dream I received this week when I worked with Angel Jeliel. It was too\nintense for me and I tried to wake up after this dream. The dream is as below:\nI visited an unknown place where my male friends lived to join a birthday party in the evening.\nThey were my old friends: Hoang , Nguyen , Quang , Nam and some others from my secondary\nschool.\nAfter the party, I slept there. Their place did not have a private area for me, so I was in the same\nroom with them. They separated into two groups and slept at two corners of the room.\nI had a vague fear of being touched by one of them. Nam touched from my foot upward. Quang saw that and reminded him not to do it\nbut he continued.\nI ran out of this place.\n(https://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/system/file\ns/styles/original_with_autorotate/\nprivate/dreams/1874/5250445891\n5-a60de7d670-o_0.jpeg?\nitok=AqGCNVKm)\nDuyen Dam (/fr/users/duyen-dam)\n\ue675 (/fr/dream-journal/1874)\ue612 (/fr/assignments/1874)\n\ue654 (/fr/user/1874/myresults)\ue938 (/fr/meditations/1874)\n\ue65eStudent,\nCorrector\nL1 - English pr…\n\ue613\n\ue916\ue915\ue914\n\ue69f\n\ue626100% (9/9) …\n\ue6b2\nÂn Nguyễn, Danièle Kremer\nSymbols\na birthday party\n-\nHoang\n-\nNguyen\n-\nQuang\n-\nNam\n-\nfootball\n-\nold man\n-\nsnake\n-\npen\n-\n(/fr/users/duyen-dam#profile-main)\n20/08/2025, 16:06\nA party | IRSS Portal - Mikaël Universe/City\nhttps://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/node/121154\n1/2\nI walked on the right side of the road. There was an old man who noticed me and he ran to me with bad intentions.\nI was so scared so I ran to the left side of the road. Many vehicles were crossing us.\nHe caught me. He hugged me and tried to push me to the pavement. I was too scared and screamed. He did not stop and he was like a\nsnake hugged at my belly.\nI stabbed him with a pen on the top of his head.\nOn the physical level, I also have the same fear. When I am in a place with a man, I am scared the person may touch me indecently. It is\none of my lessons in this life. There were some wrong touches from some older man when I was a child. I didn\'t say to my parents. I was\ntoo scared to say it to my parents. It became an obsession in my psychology. When I was a student, it was even worse. I lived with my\nfriend and she had a boyfriend. In the beginning, I let her boyfriend sleep with us. They also had sex while I slept. One day, her boyfriend\ntouched my body. I let him do it without saying No or anything else and I only felt scared and ashamed. After a while, I also had sex with\nhim when he was still in a relationship with my friend and another woman. I was terrible at that time and sometimes, I felt no light to\nsolve it. Until one day, I was brave to say No to him.\nI escaped many times but now I want to face it and rectify it rightly. I put these situations because I needed to learn from them.\nNot to hurt others to satisfy my instinctual needs. Sex is not a bad thing but a person needs wisdom.\nI learn the way to master instinctual needs constantly by meditation, and doing mantras.\nI also learned to say No rightly when it should be.\nThe people who appeared in my life did it to me to help me learn this lesson and they used to be victims by me.\nI need to accept and stop tormenting myself. It is a process to be a better version. I hurt others because of a lack of wisdom and now I\nbring light into my life to do the right thing.\nI used a lot of words "fear" in this DJ. It touches deeply about who I was, who I am, and who I will be.\nThank you very much', 'state_of_mind': None, 'notes': 'From PDF: 71. D_A party _2024'}

I watched a\npart of the comics review through the short videos and then I found the full link of the comics on the\nInternet. It happened every night after I finished my work this week. The stories are sometimes\nrelated to a woman who can be free to do the things she wants or a woman who has a lot of talent\nand gets attracted by others. It shows that the limited within me when I wanted to be free. Besides, I\nalso want to receive recognition from others. I should work on myself to transcend them and be\nmore disciplined to do the right things.\nIn my work, two of my team members had a conflict. They use the silence to solve their problem and I am the person who gives them\nsome advice to solve it. One of them told me the stories. On the one side, she gave me the whole story from her perspective. On the\nother hand, she thought she was a harsh person. It is not right when I only focus on the negative things so I try to find the positive things.\nI repeat the mantra and I am more balanced when I have a conversation with one of them. I do not push them to change immediately, I\ngive them more time to consider it carefully. Besides, I discovered that her communication can make others feel hurt. I refer back to\nmyself and realize that I am also like that. I should be more gentle to myself and others.\nI see the duality in myself when I read Korean comics and face a story from my team.\nI would like to analyze this dream as below:\n(https://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/system/file\ns/styles/original_with_autorotate/\nprivate/dreams/1874/b24efe138d\nf40da724c8f91775fcd513.jpg?\nitok=Ysp4YOzf)\nDuyen Dam (/fr/users/duyen-dam)\n\ue675 (/fr/dream-journal/1874)\ue612 (/fr/assignments/1874)\n\ue654 (/fr/user/1874/myresults)\ue938 (/fr/meditations/1874)\n\ue65eStudent,\nCorrector\nL1 - English pr…\n\ue613\n\ue916\ue915\ue914\n\ue69f\n\ue626100% (9/9) …\n\ue6b2\nÂn Nguyễn, Danièle Kremer\nSymbols\nKorean comics\n-\nflooded areas\n-\ntwo ferocious dogs\n-\na truck\n-\na TV station\n-\n(/fr/users/duyen-dam#profile-main)\n20/08/2025, 16:07\nLost | IRSS Portal - Mikaël Universe/City\nhttps://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/node/121838\n1/2\nI cycled a long way through a mountain and forest.\nThere were some parts where I had to go through flooded areas .\nAt one point, two ferocious dogs tried to bite me, but I was able to pull my leg up to avoid that.\nThen when I came to a flooded corner, I had to slowly down to wait for a truck that was being filmed by a TV station\nThank you', 'state_of_mind': None, 'notes': 'From PDF: 72.

Ngoc snuck out to take the bricks. Water started flowing out, and the guards had to deal\nwith it.

I was invited to the house of my colleague couple in a province.\nThey were very enthusiastic when they gave me an invitation. But I just made a decision after I did\nnot want to spend my holiday alone in HCM city. In the evening I went to her house after lying on the\n8-hour bus. We had dinner and then when we went to bed, she told me her funny stories with her\nfriends when she was studying at the high school. Sometimes, she skipped class and went to play\nbilliards with her classmates. She lets me review my adolescence. It is the beginning of the message I received from the Up Above on that\nnight.\nAnd the dream was as below:\nI was a teenager with my friends (male and female) studying at a high school. We lost in the evening when we rode a bicycle on the road\nwith no one and I guided the way.\nWe went around until we came to one point. We could go to the big road and we do not get lost.\nWhen I studied in class 10th . I got depression (I guessed that) because I was negative and silent a lot. I spent most of my time on the\nInternet playing games and chatting with a friend after school . I lived with two friends, but they were different so I could not\ncommunicate I told everything I had with the friend. He listened and gave me advice.

Sometimes, I\nam scared that I do not try to fix it and I only escape from that.\nI had a fever for 3 consecutive days, felt exhausted, had no vitality, and slept a lot. Then, I started a new menstrual cycle and felt dizzy.\nThat night, when I closed my eyes, I felt scared even though I was sleeping under a light. I saw black objects of unknown shaped all\naround me. The fear continued to increase, and then I forced myself to open my eyes. When I closed my eyes, there were black objects\nthat I couldn't see clearly, and when I got closer, I was even more scared, my hand became numb. .

It shows the difficulties in connecting with my inner world\nand rectifying it in the right way.\nBesides, at the physical level, my ex-boyfriend said that he did not want me to waste my time with\nhim when he did not have a clear intention for our relationship after I asked him about his silence. He thought that I should spend my\ntime for myself. He trembled and did not face me while he talked with me about that. I would like to understand what memories made us\nhave the difficulties like this. Am I sometimes focusing too much on the matter and forgetting to nourish myself and my relationships? We\nalso have our unconscious should be worked on it with rigor and love.\nI review my intention in our couple. I see it is related to my instinctive needs, emotional dependencies, getting attention, and selfishness,\nexpectations... It is not an effort to understand my partner and share with him about our life. We lost the common subject or connecting\ndeeply because of just looking at the surface, going outside, and instinctive needs too much. Many times, I asked myself why I needed to\nenter into a relationship, a family especially when my parents have had many conflicts and it had not been rectified in my memories.

I also practiced Yana breathing a week before the seminar but when I joined the lesson, I slept well.\nAt the physical level, the place where I am living also had a leaky roof. These days it rained. So our hallway became wet. I felt\nuncomfortable. I asked myself why I put the situation and what was the meaning of it. I received a dream as below:\nThe proof of my room is leaky separating my place for sleeping into 2 parts. I am sleeping on the left.\nIt was very real. I woke up immediately after seeing it.\nI do not take care of enough myself. I talked to my host about this matter. And I begin finding a new place for my living to have a better\nlife. My place is a room around 12m2 having a glass window to look at the yard but we rarely open the window, it is on the 1st floor, and\nthe house is at the end of a road so it is safe. The price is cheap and the host is friendly. At the minuses, it has some cracks, the leaky\nroof. It is like a sign to remind me that I need to take care of my inner world, my intimacy I used to think that I would leave the place to be\nmarried and live with my husband so I accept the present state of the room. It is like I do not end well so I could not begin a new cycle.\nAfter watching the presentation of Prof. Christian Muller in the last seminar and reading your revision, I saw I was trying to connect with\nthe inaccessible love and instinctual needs. It's time to work on myself and do the right thing for me and him. I should end our\nrelationship well by stopping to connect with him, working on his pluses and minuses, following my dreams, and building my inner\ncouple.\nThank you", 'state_of_mind': None, 'notes': 'From PDF: 88.

I was more rebellious and did not want to go\ndeeply into the problem anymore. I feel disturbed, I am tired. When we stopped our conversation, two of us were very angry. We kept\nsilent after that. I also thought I was not wrong to say sorry immediately after finishing it. The atmosphere was too heavy. I took time and\ncalmed down. I sent him a message to say sorry to him for my attitude. That evening, I felt so tired and I cried a lot. It was very heavy for\nme and I couldn't handle it.

My feelings went down too much\nbecause it touched my core and triggered many of my memories. Today, I met a male tax official\nrelated to a tax that was applied in 2015 and there was a mistake in the tax code. In the beginning, I\ndid a paper to meet the required laws but it did not work. So the tax official required me to give a\nlittle money to another female tax official to solve the problem. I had a hesitation to do it then I did\nit. After that, I felt angry and tired. I asked myself why I needed to do it. I thought that I was doing the wrong thing and helped it continue\nin the wrong way. At noon, I had a conversation with my manager about this story. He told me that it was a normal rule when I worked\nwith the government, I needed to accept it because it is a part of our life. It is like an exchange and sometimes, I need to do it to complete\nmy work. I remember when I graduated from a university in the Logistics field. I denied a part of my career related to customs. I\nunderstood the responsibilities of customs but I felt disgusted with "money under the table" to have a smooth process. It is an important\nsubject I need to face. Through the Law of Resonance, I am visiting the part of myself where I am too materialistic, I did not complete my\nresponsibility and would like to get something from others. Besides, I am judging others and could not accept the part irritation in myself\nand others. Sometimes, it helps us learn how to accept evil.\nI would like to analyze a dream I had: I was in a class with many older people . I needed to talk to them about spirituality and had them\nstudy it.\n(https://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/system/file\ns/styles/original_with_autorotate/\nprivate/dreams/1874/img_4186.jp\neg?itok=TJaOInIM)\nDuyen Dam (/fr/users/duyen-dam)\n\ue675 (/fr/dream-journal/1874)\ue612 (/fr/assignments/1874)\n\ue654 (/fr/user/1874/myresults)\ue938 (/fr/meditations/1874)\n\ue65eStudent,\nCorrector\nL1 - English pr…\n\ue613\n\ue916\ue915\ue914\n\ue69f\n\ue626100% (9/9) …\n\ue6b2\nÂn Nguyễn, Danièle Kremer\nSymbols\na male tax official\n-\nmany older people\n-\n(/fr/users/duyen-dam#profile-main)\n21/08/2025, 09:21\nMoney under the table | IRSS Portal - Mikaël Universe/City\nhttps://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/node/129824\n1/2\nThese days, I am more careful with myself.

I also\ngave myself the idea that I had a great job, it helped me have more time to learn DSSI through three\nyears. I am asking the Up Above the way I need to manifest for a new job because I am not working\nin the field that I want to work deeply and longly. I am taking action: fixing my CV, finding a new job\non the online platform, learning English, preparing for interviews, committing to doing more to my\nplan ... but sometimes I see doubt about my ability. I have an inferiority complex when I am not\nconfident in myself. I also see that "I\'m not good enough" and I need to learn as much as possible. I\ndelay taking action and finding more courses to learn.\nWhen I worked with the Angel Nelkhael, I received a dream as below: instinctual forces and needs that generate and influence our\ncapacity and way of thinking\nI gathered with some people in a room of a place like a coffee store There was a bird and a tiger cub\nI tried to get attention from the bird by looking at it.\nAt one moment, the bird came to me so, I hugged it with my left hand to protect it because it cannot fly.\n(https://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/system/file\ns/styles/original_with_autorotate/\nprivate/dreams/1874/istockphoto-\n1060732356-1024x1024.jpg?\nitok=Q44RsBc3)\nDuyen Dam (/fr/users/duyen-dam)\n\ue675 (/fr/dream-journal/1874)\ue612 (/fr/assignments/1874)\n\ue654 (/fr/user/1874/myresults)\ue938 (/fr/meditations/1874)\n\ue65eStudent,\nCorrector\nL1 - English pr…\n\ue613\n\ue916\ue915\ue914\n\ue69f\n\ue626100% (9/9) …\n\ue6b2\nÂn Nguyễn, Danièle Kremer\nSymbols\ncoffee store\n-\na bird\n-\na tiger cub\n-\n18:15\n-\n(/fr/users/duyen-dam#profile-main)\n21/08/2025, 09:23\nA Bird and A Tiger | IRSS Portal - Mikaël Universe/City\nhttps://dssi.ucm.ca/fr/node/131036\n1/2\nThen, the tiger cub came to me. The cub belonged to a woman but he followed me so I hugged it with my right hand and I thought I\nwould turn it back to the owner tomorrow.\nIt was time to leave. When I nearly left the place with two animals, on my left hand, the bird transferred to the skeletons put in the bag.\nI couldn\'t believe that so I went to the camera room for a check. But it was over 18:15 so no one was in the room. I saw a male guard\nwho was sitting not far away. I told him about the bird. I realized that the cub also disappeared.\nI see a little bit of my qualities in the dream that I take responsibility for taking care of the two animals. I asked myself when I have the\nabove pattern in my life. There is a wrong intention at the beginning when I am with others. I should be present and nourish the\nrelationships by understanding myself and others instead of focusing on my needs. When something is lost, I need to keep a global vision\nnot to dramatize or trivialize. Besides, I expect people in the outer world too much. I can ask for help but no expectation. I should take\ncare of myself and do the best I can.\nWhen I did this dream journal, I realized I did not want to go to sleep when I could not interpret this dream smoothly. I kept me awake\nuntil 3 am but I did not work instead I watched entertainment videos and ate something. There was a feeling that I needed to complete\nbut another of me rejected doing the right things. I have not found the right way. I think a solution is that I go to sleep and wake up\nearlier to do the dream journal. Besides, I can give myself a little time to watch videos when I have free time. It is to help me not repress\nmyself and still do the right things. Is it mechanical?\nThank you', 'state_of_mind': None, 'notes': 'From PDF: 97. D_A Bird and A Tiger _ 2025'}

I\nwould like to analyze the dream as below:\n"I heard that Nhi said to me that she will leave at the coffee store and she would do another job in\na food store regarding issue ... who contacted me recently."\nThese dreams show that I have difficulty nourishing my inner world at a social level. I also have a fear\nthat Nhi could leave the store because she is very good member. I even understand that I need to\nbring more benefits for her and help her develop herself. I think the positive point is that I find a\nsolution by connecting the new employees instead of depending on the other members\nI think about the commitment to working. How do I have the right fidelity? I appreciate my work where I do the best and I give effort but it\nis not related to the field I would like to do for the long term. I do not understand why I sometimes like something and dislike something.\nI would like to work in producing the products more than giving the services related to communication. I have a tendency to avoid\ncommunicating because I do not pay attention to others and sometimes, it has more facade than I can imagine even when I have studied\nthis course related to conscience. That day, my mind was so complicated. I manage a coffee store with 5 members. This week, one full-\ntime staff, Nhi has some days off. The day before I received the dream, Vy one of them registered to work with the store in the morning. I\nwas happy because that day, the coffee store only had one member, Nguyen , had registered and I had to come early to support him.

Her period should\nbegin at 6:30 am. I saw her send me a message for coming late around 1 hour later without a clear explanation at 7:00 am, I felt she was\nirresponsible. I supported Nguyen and I asked myself why I was so annoyed. What should I do? I realized that I did not believe her when\nshe changed her schedule and was late for work. I decided to ask her the reason instead of guessing and I only focused on supporting my\nteam. Then my anger disappeared.\nBesides, after trying learning and working at the store, a new member rejected continuing the next day. I do not understand its\nmeaning. Besides, I also asked myself what I should do for my team. Because I feel it is not easy to have a good vision for the store. The\nbusiness is a part of my work but I have rejected it for a long time because I do not know too much related to it. It is apart that I felt\nuncomfortable when I did not know how I could develop it in the future. What standard do I can give to the coffee store? How do I take\ncare of it?\nIt cannot depend on any member. It should create a good environment and bring value to the customer. How do I develop it? Focusing on\nthe customer experience? Because I do not want to attach myself for too long I do it temporarily.\nMy major is related to International Business. I would like to go back to supply chain management. It is more related to my major than my\npresent job. It makes me dizzied when I cannot advance rightly. I even reminded myself that I needed to develop my qualities. What\nshould I do in this case?\nI do not know in my case. I should create the vision for the coffee store and do the related things to get the goal. Of course, it should be a\nlong-term goal including the revenue target and the qualities related to customer service. It is not clear enough but I can research and do\nthe best for it not only the customers but also the employees of the coffee store. Sometimes, I ask myself what I can do for our team, and\nwhat training I could bring for them.\nThank you', 'state_of_mind': None, 'notes': 'From PDF: 98. D_Leaving _ 2025'}
