file: A weird proposal; last dream id: D0000; Date of dream: Tuesday, February 15, 2022 Angel: 18 Caliel State of mind: Surprised, Angry, Afraid, Disappoited Dream and analysis: Good morning, my professor and assistant professor! Thank you for guiding me on this journey. I worked with the angel Caliel with the important question: "Is my boyfriend a husband fit for my developing quality" (I have asked it for two months) Here is my first dream: My boyfriend and I came back to his home - not his present house. His family had dinner but we have not eaten . I prepared the meal for both of us. His younger sister showed me the place to take the food. The preparation was nearly completed with a lack of fish sauce so he was taking it. I went down to the ground floor while he was on the high floor . Then he finished making fish sauce, I went up without his call. When I am on the highest floor, he and my old girlfriend swinged down by rope and he dropped the friend off. He intended to ask me to marry but I was at the beginning position and I was looking down. The second dream: "I was attacked by a white strong light from both sides when I ran after a friend I could not open my eyes . I did Tai Chi weakly before I fainted." I am too strict on myself, it prevents me from receiving the reality related to 2 polarities. The third dream: " My friend, Y and I discovered a white strange paint stain falling down from the roof when my paternal family gathered to celebrate flew down to find us but we escaped so it flew away. A next scene, a white paint stain from the roof fell down on some children , they just dissolved, a big creature attacked, luckily a man hit the creature and it disappeared. A next scent, when the family gathered in the attic , my mother and I saw a paint stain, and I announced dissolving immediately. Everyone except I and Y ran to the door . We hid to the back, jumped to other roofs to hide and find the signal of the creature. Some of the adults also found it when he was preparing to attack but it ran away in our way. I was protected by my cousin when I was on the roof. Then, I was on the way back home . I have just been on a bridge then a big water flowed and brought a big shark . I held the bridge and pretended to die and escaped. When I was at home, I decided to pick my lover up to my house to have dinner. His home is in a military area . It used to be a school where I spent my time when I was a child. I guaranteed to protect him and I believed I can do it. When I crossed the military school, it was a big wind but I still took him to his home." Third dream is "I was in a class and prepared for an examination . A woman teacher guided me using a cow replace a pig for the examination ." Fourth dream is " a registration of marriage " There are some memories let me leave off the spiritual way. Fifth dream is "I, Oanh Quang , Nguyen and some friends gathered at a place on a floor to chat and then moved to a party . We needed to walk to the party. The street was like a street coming to . There were. many groups dressed in different clothes . I was suddenly called from a group. The group is 3 girls wearing hoodies . I was invited to dance together with them on the platform. Then I moved to another place. All my friends disappeared . I knew they were coming back in the first place, I was waiting for them in anger. After a long time, they rode across me to leave." Thank you very much.

file: Binh Yen Noi campsite; last dream id: D0006; Date of dream: Thursday, May 5, 2022 Angel: 9 Haziel State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana Wish you have a nice day!!! This period time, I continue focusing to the question: "Is my present job still suitable for my life program?" I received some dreams from the Up-Above but I cannot remember. My company has a big change in the next time. My boss confirmed to sell our company. I can continue working at the present position. The new owner will invest and expand the company with a big mission. Is it a good sign for myself? I have not met the new owner. My manager told me the new owner was a rich group. Buying our company is just a small project. The company can join to a supply chain with other companies in the group. I think I should ask the Up Above to have an answer more clearly. I also noted a dream this week as below: 1. I came to Binh Yen Noi - in English, it means a peace place where I and my friends went camping as I told you in last dream journal. I came to take a birthday cake ..I reserved. 2. I was on the way coming to my company. I try a new way. I went up following 2 young men They gave up when they were in the middle of a slope. I felt the way was not right but I still wanted to try. I went to the highest of the slope and saw Binh Yen Noi . I told the waiter I was lost, he guided me went down because of no other ways. will be late at my work. I tried to run to my company . The company was in a building. I forgot bringing the elevator card I ran to the elevator and received the help from the guards. Coming in the company, I saw two men who were threatening me There were a man who we had a deep relationship and a man who I was in a love relationship. They were protecting me . Duyen Thank you

file: Vegetable Rows in a House; last dream id: D0007; Date of dream: Wednesday, April 2, 2025 Angel: 15 Hariel State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle, I would like to analyze this dream as below: I saw vegetable rows in a house , and I want to water them. There were Vy and Sao . I pulled the hose to water them, and had to go around in all sorts of ways. I also met a female water seller in front of the house, who didn't want me to pull the hose through her position because she felt it was quite annoying. She still let me pass. AS SAID ABOVE, Everyone told me to water them too much . The seller accidentally had an unexpected event at home and needed money. , so she asked Sao if he could pay back some of the money he owed. He went in and took out some of the water bottles to pay. That morning, before going to work, I dropped a small bottle of perfume on the ground. The bottle did not break, but a little spilled out. I did not realize that the perfume had spilled into the box of vegetables I cooked to bring to the company to eat. When I analyzed my dream, I asked myself how emotions ("water") can nourish emotions ("vegetables"). I did not realize that point consciously and it's time to work on that. It shows that I think too much more than I feel. Emotions are something that I have, but I didn't know how to nourish them. That is the reason why I am at the intellectual level more than at the emotional level. Sometimes, I just find a way to adjust my thoughts and then adjust my feelings. I also see that I do not notice my feelings enough, but I can discern my thoughts when it has a problem. This is one of the reasons making me have difficulty analyzing this dream. I asked myself: "How am I nourishing my emotions? Are emotions important to me?" There were some confusions in me for this topic. I realize that I am trying to go deeply into a topic instead of ignoring that. Thank you Duyen Reviewer's Message: A lovely hello Ân, I would like to share this interpretation with you, it took me a while to do it and I'm not completely sure. Angélique gratitude, Danièle 🙏🌸

file: A deny to connect; last dream id: D0008; Date of dream: Saturday, April 12, 2025 Angel: 44 Yelahiah State of mind: Uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle, I am so touched when I read your revision. Everything is synchronicity when I am working on my emotions with Angel Damabiah, then I receive your revisions. They help me understand myself at the emotional level. , I am on the Besides journey to research a scholarship to learn a Master's in Supply Chain Management in Europe. I want to dive deeply into the major. I have an intention to develop my patience, concentration, and perseverance. Because I discovered that I used to give up many times in learning English, it showed my difficulties in manifestation, and this year, I would like to understand it deeply. I spend every day writing down any subject like a journal, and I see myself giving many reasons not to do things, and I could persuade myself to do my best. I asked myself why I do not write down the beautiful things and the improved things I learned instead of giving up. The resistance is big and I need more time to understand it, coming from and transforming. When I practiced Yana breathing, I felt so heavy in my heart chakra. I tried to breathe through the heaviness, and at the end of this practice, I felt softer and had a strange feeling at my third chakra. I also heard a voice that why I need to force myself to breathe like this, I need to love myself, and do the soft things. I heard this voice many times, when I wanted to learn English deeply after working. The voice told me that I was forcing myself, I needed to respect my rhythm, so I do not make efforts, and I need to change to relax. And I also see my fear that I am not qualified enough to learn a Master's with a scholarship. But this time, I would like to learn to manifest in the right way, so I continue searching, learning English, and listening to Up Above's guidance through my dream and my concrete life. I was recently reminded by a DSSI friend that the spiritual journey is autonomy, I should be careful not to have a dependency on Up Above like I pray, but I do not move my feet. I would like to analyze a dream when I invoked the Angel Yelahiah - my emotional birth angel and I would like to understand why I refuse to face a conflict: I sat down with Ai somewhere. I needed to contact Bang Tuyen urgently in my hometown, because I was careless and gave the wrong information to Tuyen. When Ai knew my fault, she was very angry and required me to fix it immediately. She even started calling and gave the phone to me. But on the other side, some people were joking, so they did not reply . I was uncomfortable, and I asked her to turn off the call, and I would call again later. The previous morning, Ai was a person who asked me whether my relationship with my ex-boyfriend continued or not. Because she and another female friend wanted to kick him out of my friends' chat group that we had been added to. I said he and I stopped, and she could do what she wanted. I asked myself if it was right. He came to my friends' group, but he can be our friend even though he and I broke up. I think I am growing more and more when I improve my concentration and patience in doing the right things. Of course, it can not lack love, but it also has to have the right rigor. Thank you Duyen Reviewer's Message: A lovely hello, An, thank you for your help and comments. I would like to send you this review, as well as for the advice given. Angelic thoughts, Danielle 🙏

file: Nourishing a Right Love; last dream id: D0009; Date of dream: Thursday, May 1, 2025 Angel: 22 Yeiayel State of mind: Comfortable Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle, I came home for a 4-day holiday and I am working with Angel Yeiayel. I would like to analyze my dream: I was sitting in a restaurant . There were two friends sitting in front of us and turning around to talk to us and two male friends sitting to my left. While we were there, I overheard something about an upcoming birthday but I wasn't sure whose it was. I also listened to some bad news but I couldn't remember. Eventually, a birthday cake appeared, and we all celebrated— it turned out to be for the male friend beside me, whose nickname was " Mouse ". Another male friend joined in, pretending it was his birthday too, making everyone laugh. The atmosphere was joyful, and the male friend next to me—who felt like my boyfriend —was gentle and kind and I felt a warm connection between us. Later, the other male friend mentioned that he liked cheerful work, like the kind I do, and asked me to let him know if I heard of any similar job opportunities. That day, I met with some friends who are now very busy with their children. Even though they came to a gathering, they couldn't spend much time with the group. One of my friends called me by an ugly name many times, this time, I stood up for myself and told him not to speak to me that way, but he continued, and it exhausted me. During a short conversation, he asked what I had learned from DSSI and how I could prove my level. I felt uncomfortable. I didn't feel it was the right time or place to explain what I had learned, especially since he seemed focused only on concrete results. I refused to go into detail and kept evolving his questions, though apart from me feared that might damage our friendship. Finally, one of my friends wanted to share something she was passionate about and asked me to listen. But I started to sense that some of what she shared didn't feel right to me—it seemed to deny something negative or even harmful. I felt conflicted. I didn't think she would accept my perspective. I'm still unsure what the right thing is—for me or for her. I know she means well and wants to help, but I also know I need to be true to what I've learned and believe. Additionally, I hurt my right thumb twice recently, which reminded me how easy it is to judge others without seeing the full picture. Maybe what we see as someone's mistake is actually tied to a deeper story—or even karma from past lives. This helped me remember not to judge others. Coming home and observing the way my parents live I understand that there are some renunciations I should do deeply on myself and change myself, not changing others. THANK YOU Duyen Reviewer's Message: A lovely hello, An. I'd like to send you this review for the advice you gave. Thank you for your help; I'm learning a lot of practical things with Duyen.

To see my niece, Cat, I passed by and looked into. Dream 2 : When I lived with a friend In my countryside, . I unintentionally scared a male friend who felt I was harassing him. I didn't explain because I mistakenly thought it was just because he was handsome. Dream 3: I was sitting at the dining table with Quang , Hoang . Then Oanh came in and wanted me to decode her dream. Hoang's attitude is very unpleasant. Dream 4 : Phap and another friend cycled past where I lived. I've also felt more connected to the love I receive in my life. For example, when some colleagues made mistakes, I initially felt frustrated and thought they should have been more careful. But instead of reacting, I stayed calm and shared my point of view gently. I've become more aware that I'm working with human beings, not robots, and that awareness makes me feel more connected to them. My mother recently reminded me that while I can be a vegetarian, I should consider eating what others eat in social situations, so I can be more easily accepted. At first, I might have resisted this advice, but now I understand it came from a place of love and concern. She's worried about me, and I no longer feel the need to argue like I used to. Instead, I appreciate her perspective and even encourage her to take care of her own health, especially since she was unhappy at the time. I respect the rhythm of my family and the wisdom it brings. I feel happy and softer than before. Of course, I'm still working on my insecurities — especially the desire for love and attention from others — but I'm starting to see that everything I seek already exists within me. And I'm learning to recognize and trust that more each day. THANK YOU Duyen Reviewer's Message: A beautiful hello Ân, Short dreams, very subtle, for his guidance. I didn't note the niece's name "Cat", I imagine she dreams in Vietnamese, to avoid creating a judgment. Even if in the next dream we still see a bit of cat-like behavior. Angélique gratitude 🙏🌸, Danièle

file: Restructure; last dream id: D0014; Date of dream: Friday, May 30, 2025 Angel: 68 Habuhiah Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle This week, I achieved significant efficiency by restructuring my coffee business. A team member suggested a better salary, prompting me to reconsider. After discussions with my boss and manager, I implemented a new KPI and Revenue structure for my coffee team, offering increased bonuses for goal achievement. Other new structures were also introduced. While not exactly what she expected, it confirmed I had listened to her concerns. I reflected on why this weighed so heavily on me, realizing my appreciation for her efforts in the store. However, I recognized a need to improve how I manifest my intentions. I must commit to following my structure, including random task evaluations, which will offer a new perspective to the team. I need to act more as a manager and less as just a guide. I accept who I am and will do my best. I also found myself frustrated with a supplier who repeatedly made the same mistake. Attempts to explain were met with refusal, leading to monthly errors. I realized my energy is stronger now, and I questioned whether I could change her or if a different approach would yield better results. I need to use the right energy to communicate with her. I felt paralyzed when I realized I only had a week to submit my exercises. While I made progress this month—preparing the PR early, the Source Code in the middle, and the Angelica Yantra at the beginning—leaving me with less work, I was still exhausted this week. To counter this, I dedicated one evening to meditation and relaxation, simply lying down without doing anything. I understand this exhaustion is an accumulation of memories, and I am learning to transform them. I would like to analyze this dream: The large campus featured a study area and a residential zone, divided by a stream. I ARRIVED early, hoping to rent a temporary room for a nap However, upon entering the right building , I found every room occupied. I spoke with the female manager , alongside two other girls, also seeking accommodation. She informed me that rooms were only rented monthly and that this was the male section. She then led the two girls to the female area across the way. I sensed her discomfort with my presence, but thankfully, one of the girls pulled me along. On the other side, the other male manager said something like There were no rooms available. I saw Ngan there, though she seemed unfamiliar. Then I left. I stopped by the food court and ran into several old friends, both male and female, whom I hadn't seen in a while. They were enjoying themselves at the counter, picking out food, chatting before heading off. I was in another scene, like in a class, and there was a reaction related to lightning . I recently had a dream where I was driving my ex-boyfriend to his company, making a right turn. It felt like a stark reminder that I'm repeating old patterns. I spoke to him that he should be the one driving me. This dream makes me think about how recently I am trying to make myself in work, I have a fear that if I do not do anything, I will be like a die, I will go down, I will not develop. So even when I want to watch something, I use the English video to help me learn it and become familiar with it. I think I can give myself a little time for breaking to breathe and doing the mantra. Relaxing in the right way is a good thing for my evolution. When I think about the symbol of my boyfriend in my dream, I realize that he is a part of me and he spends most of his time working. Even when his work is over, he can cut all of his time to just work and some basic activities for a long time. He just spent a little time on our relationship after he arranged for his sport, his party with his colleagues. I accept that he needs to relax when he works a lot like that. But his balance is not easy, even though he rarely calls his family. He thinks that he should earn money for the future of my parents, but when he comes back to his home with his family, he spends most of the time gathering and drinking beer. His mother told me that he did not share anything."
