IT MEANS THAT SOMETIMES IN THE SOCIAL LEVEL, YOU COULD HAVE LAZINESS, WANTING TO REST TOO MUCH... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... ] . There are my boss, 2 staff and myself, 2 boys and 2 girls. WHEN YOU MENTION ABOUT THE PEOPLE LIKE BOSS, STAFF ETC, YOU CAN ANALYSE EITHER THEIR + OR - DEPENDING UPON HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THEM IN THE DREAM. THE NUMBER 2 HERE SHOWS ABOUT THE DYNAMICS OF RELATIONSHIPS We arrive and found that we have not enough motorbikes [- limitation in my capacity to advance individually, laziness, difficulty to make effort to advance in life YES, WELL ANALYSED. ] to go around. Everybody asks me to borrow my mother's motorbike. = SOCIAL PRESSURE THAT YOU COULD PUT ON YOURSELF SOMETIMES... AND IT EVENTUALLY CREATES DUALITIES IN YOU "I WANT, I DON'T WANT" However, I hesitate to call my mom. Because I don't want my mom [- ORIGIN OF YOUR feminity, YOUR FEMININE POLARITY, YOU HAVE MADE A GOOD EFFORT TO USE THE PARENTHESIS TO ANALYZE YOUR INNER MOTHER, YOU CAN WRITE MORE ABOUT HOW YOU PERCEIVE YOUR MOTHER, IT WILL HELP TO UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DID NOT WANT TO CONNECT WITH YOUR ORIGIN...

From this dream, I think that my femininity, THE ORIGIN OF YOUR FEMININE POLARITY was isolated IT SHOWS THE DIFFICULTY TO GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR EMOTIONS AND YOUR INNER WORLD not feeling close, attached to my masculinity, with my whole being. I have not enough effort on my work, my career path, and that problem from my femininity. Actually, my femininity was not too tough to I think. I should give more love and more embrace my femininity (increase my receptivity), I can improve the way to advance on my career, my work.

title_pdf: 03 Dream - Lost. last case id: C0177. PDF text: Dream date: Thursday, 18 March 2021 Angel: 31 Lecabel Dream mood: confusion, doing my best, worrying Dream and Analysis: ANGELIC HELLO NHU, I mantra Angel 31 Lecabel with the question: Why am I always obsessed with success, wealth, and money? IT IS A PROFOUND QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED... LET'S SEE WHAT UP ABOVE ANSWERED YOU ... We have 3 people on a dirt road, rock, dust. [- road: difficulty determining an objective or goal, lack of motivation, enthusiasm, courage, fear of change, get lost DIFFICULTY TO MOVE OR ADVANCE IN THE COLLECTIVE LEVEL DUE TO INNER EMOTIONS WHICH ARE NOT YET SUITABLE FOR SUPPORTING AND THE ROCK IS ALSO RELATED TO MINERAL REIGN WHICH MEANS OLD MEMORIES, OLD ACTIONS FROM THE PAST THAT ARE UNCONSCIOUS... ] Myself, Joe and Nhu. [+ femininity: listen, work hard, logic, clear, fair ] Joe (woman) is a technology team lead in my company. She is older than me. She is very kind, clear, protects the benefits for the team members and is fair to everyone. A person who always tries, works hard at work, works with 200% ability every day, always does everything in the best possible way, time clearly and expects good things in work and life. A person who loves the environment and animals. She is a green lifestyle person that I am also following. AND YOU COULD USE THE POSITIVE STYLE TO DESCRIBE THE POSITIVE ASPECT AND THIS DREAM IS MORE NEGATIVE YOU COULD ANALYZE HER NEGATIVE ASPECT SO AS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ASPECTS YOU ARE WORKING INSIDE OF YOU... Nhu (woman) is a staff on my team. She is younger than me. She is very intelligent, proactive, positive, cheerful, and has clear, coherent, and logical work standards. She has the potential to become a leader in the future. THE 3 FEMALES IN THE DREAM SHOW YOUR INNER WORLD, IT SHOWS THE DYNAMICS OF HOW YOU FEEL INSIDE WHEN YOU WISH TO ADVANCE ON THE SOCIAL LEVEL. SINCE YOU ARE STUCK ON THE WAY, THE DREAM IS NEGATIVE, AND LOOKING INTO THE MINUSES OF JOE AND NHU WILL GREATLY HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE EMOTIONS, INTENTIONS, AND ATTITUDES WHICH MAY AFFECT YOU WHILE YOU WISH TO ADVANCE. FOR E.G THE DOUBTS, FEARS, ETC THAT YOU MAY EXPERIENCE IN THE PROCESS... We have only 1 motorbike. [- lack of motivation in work, in life AND SINCE THERE ARE ONLY 1 MOTORBIKE AND 3 PEOPLE, IT SHOWS THAT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE A LIMITATION IN YOUR ADVANCEMENT TOWARDS YOUR OBJECTIVES, AND WHEN YOU LINK THAT WITH YOUR QUESTION MENTIONED ABOVE, SOMETIMES YOU COULD EVENTUALLY FEEL THAT YOU COULD NOT EXPRESS YOUR FULL POTENTIAL (POSITIVITY, INTELLIGENCE, PROACTIVITY, "HARD WORKER", FAIR, ETC.) AND WHEN YOU ARE LIMITED IN THE EXPRESSION OF YOUR POTENTIAL IT COULD EVENTUALLY CREATE ASPECTS IN YOU WHERE YOU COULD FORCE IN MATTER... AIMING FOR SUCCESS INSTEAD OF FINDING THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS LIMITATION.... ] -> I have a little good willpower in mine but I haven't had enough motivation in work, in life BECAUSE YOU HAVE MEMORIES WHERE YOU HAVE FORCED TOO MUCH AND NOT WITH THE RIGHT INTENTION... There are 2 roads in front (fork), I don't know which way to go. Both roads are detours, we can not see where to go. There is one road above and one below. There is a car pass by, it goes down the road below. We know for sure these two roads lead to the station and rest. SINCE BOTH ROADS ARE DETOURS, IT MEANS A LACK OF THE PROPER PATH OR ROAD. A LACK OF INNER STRUCTURE AND THE ATTITUDE TO LOOK FOR SHORT-CUTS OR QUICK WAYS TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING... AND THE NOTION OF THE ROAD THAT GOES ABOVE AND ONE BELOW MEANS THAT YOU HAVE DUALITIES AND DIFFICULTIES TO ORIENT YOURSELF IN YOUR LIFE... AND WITH THE DREAM YOU COULD MAKE A PARALLEL WITH SPIRIT AND MATTER... (ABOVE AND BELOW) THAT YOU HAVE DIFFICULTIES TO KNOW WHAT COULD BE GOOD FOR YOUR LIFE AS SOMETIMES YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE IN A REST AND LAZINESS MODE (MATTER) INSTEAD OF WORKING PROFOUNDLY ON YOURSELF (SPIRIT) AS SEEN WITH YOUR INNER JOE AND INNER NHU... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... At this time, there is a motorbike pass by and help us. We let Nhu go first. I will go later with Joe. The motorbike goes on the road above. Then, there was another car that continues going on the road below. This car was very weird. There was no roof. I feel it was made of faces wooden tables put together. A driver is a Western man. AND WHAT IS GOOD IS THAT THERE IS ONE PERSON THAT HELPS YOU... BUT YOU SAID "ONE MOTORBIKE HELP US" IT MEANS ALSO THAT SOMETIMES YOU SEE MORE THE RESULT THAN THE RELATIONSHIP THAT COULD BE EVENTUALLY BUILT... SO IN THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL (MOTORBIKE), YOU ARE ABLE TO ADVANCE IN THE SPIRITUAL LEVEL WITH SOME HELP BUT THIS SHOWS ALSO THE MEMORIES IN YOU WHERE THE PERSONAL/INDIVIDUAL ADVANCEMENT TAKES PRIORITY. YOU MAY WISH TO MOVE FORWARD WITH YOUR POTENTIAL OF BECOMING A LEADER, BUT YOU MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT OR HAVE THE LACK OF RESOURCES TO ADVANCE IN THE COLLECTIVE... A WESTERN MAN IN THE MINUS CAN BE RELATED TO THE FOCUS ON MONEY, MATERIAL ABUNDANCE, BEING TOO COMPLICATED WITH NEEDS, TO BE TOO COMFORTABLE ON MATTER... SO YOU WISH TO MOVE AHEAD IN THE COLLECTIVE WITH THE MOTIVE OF ATTAINING MATERIAL ABUNDANCE... AND THIS IS ALSO A PART OF THE ANSWER OF YOUR QUESTION... YOU ARE ALSO THIS WESTERN MAN... WHERE IN THE PAST, YOU MAY HAVE EXPERIENCED WEALTH, ABUNDANCE, SUCCESS THAT EVENTUALLY YOU WOULD LIKE TO FIND BACK IN THIS LIFE BUT YOU ARE SHOWN THAT YOU HAVE SOME LIMITATIONS RELATED TO THE CAR MADE OF WOOD... WHICH IS RELATED TO LACK OF SOLIDITY, POVERTY (IN THAT CASE) AS YOUR INNER WESTERN MAN IS NOT WELL EQUIPPED TO DO ADVANCE (WOODEN CAR), MORE SO THE CAR IS MADE OF TABLE TOPS WHICH INDICATES THAT THE INTERACTIONS IN THE SOCIETY COULD BE DONE WITH A PERCENTAGE OF INTENTION OF MOVING AHEAD IN TO ACHIEVE AMBITIONS, THIS MAY THUS CREATE A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING AND WARMTH IN THE RELATIONSHIPS. SO YOU HAVE ANOTHER ANSWER HERE WHERE YOU COULD BE TOO FOCUS ON THE RESULT, ON THE ARRIVAL INSTEAD OF TAKING CARE OF THE RELATIONAL LEVEL, INSTEAD OF GIVING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT, CARING AND LOVE... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... We decide to take the road that the motorbike went - the road above. Because I think the other road is only suitable for cars, not for motorbikes. The motorbike broke down before, we couldn't use it, and I don't know how the both of us could go to the station safely. [+ desire to change my life, searching for a new direction on the level of social action ] [- difficulty to move life from one stage to another on the action and social level, seek to flee my life plan, lack of direction, multiple choices HERE IT IS MORE THE NEGATIVE ASPECT, YOU ARE SHOWN LIMITATION IN YOU... SINCE YOU ARE SEPARATED FROM YOUR INNER NHU THAT REPRESENTS LEADERSHIP, POSITIVITY, INTELLIGENCE, YOU COULD HAVE DIFFICULTIES TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE IN YOUR LIFE... AND THIS IS WHAT COULD HAPPEN WHEN YOU ARE TOO FOCUS ON MATTER, ON THE RESULT, THE SUCCESS... YOU COULD EVENTUALLY LOSE YOUR ORIENTATION AND STRENGTH SINCE THERE ARE ALSO MEMORIES OF LAZINESS (STATION TO REST) AND THIS DREAM WILL HELP YOU WHEN YOU ARE MORE THAN 100 % AT WORK AND SOMETIMES TIRED TO WORK... SINCE THEY ARE CERTAIN NEGATIVE MEMORIES THAT LIMIT YOUR GREAT POTENTIAL... ] -> I have got lost of direction in my life, my work and I found some small things that I could follow. YES...AND YOU COULD COMPLETE THIS UNDERSTANDING WITH COMMENTS ABOVE We come to meet Nhu. Nhu said that she waited for us a long time. She thought as if we could not come, she also did not know how to contact us. She was very worried about us. It was a small station, a cement house, deserted around, opposite the other side of the road was a row of trees, on a rocky, sandy road. There is a small porch with a roof. There's a map here, so everyone can find their way back AND SINCE NHU HAS WAITED FOR A LONG TIME, IT MEANS THAT YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO LOSE YOUR ROAD IN LIFE OTHERWISE CERTAIN NEGATIVE MEMORIES COULD LEAD YOU TO MORE LIMITATION (WOODEN CAR + BROKEN MOTORBIKE) AND YOU ARE ALSO SHOWN A BEAUTIFUL POSSIBILITY IN YOU TO GET THE GUIDANCE FROM UP ABOVE (MAP). SINCE YOU REALIZE LATER IN THE DREAM THAT YOU WERE ON A TRIP AND WERE LOST. THE UNIVERSE IS SHOWING YOU THE REASON FOR THE LACK OF MOTIVATION. YOUR ATTITUDE WHILE ON THE WAY TO SOCIAL ADVANCEMENT MAY BE A LITTLE LAX AND CASUAL VERSUS FORCING, TOO MUCH IN A HARDWORKING MODE WHICH YOU MAY NOT REALIZE AND LATER MAY FEEL DE-MOTIVATED TO DO YOUR TASK /WORK BECAUSE YOU MAY NOT RECEIVE THE RESULTS YOU EXPECTED IN YOUR MIND. BUT NOW, THE DREAM IS SHOWING THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO UNDERSTAND THE REASON BEHIND YOUR LACK OF MOTIVATION, AND GRADUALLY YOU WILL GET THE MAP WHICH LEADS YOU TOWARDS THE RIGHT ATTITUDE AND ACTION [+ overall view of already existing roads, an ability to find resources, a capacity to guide others ] At this point, I just know that the 3 of us are on a trip and get lost. Before that, I had no idea why the 3 of us were here, where this is, how to return, why we had to go that way. Now, I know our purpose is to go to the station, to ask local people to contact us to find a way to 23/07/2025, 11:02 Lost | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/79057 2/3 return. SOMETIMES YOU CAN FEEL A LACK OF MOTIVATION IN YOUR WORK OR IN LIFE IN GENERAL BECAUSE OF THE MEMORIES WHERE YOU DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND GUIDANCE AND ALSO BECAUSE YOU HAVE WORK TOO MUCH WITH THE INTENTION TO HAVE A COMFORTABLE LIFE INSTEAD OF SEEING THE IMPROVEMENT OF YOUR QUALITIES, OF YOUR SOUL... BUT THIS DREAM IS SHOWING A BEAUTIFUL POSSIBILITY IN YOU TO FIND THE MAP TO THE RIGHT PATH. YOU ARE BEING SHOWN THE POSSIBILITY OF CREATING A STRUCTURE AND SUPPORT IN THE SOCIAL ADVANCEMENT. From this dream, I think I have got lost in my path (work and life), I haven't enough motivation and enthusiasm at first. But then, I find out the guidance, the direction and new purposes for my life. But I can't still answer my question from this dream. YOU CAN COMPLETE WITH COMMENTS ABOVE... THIS DREAM IS A PROFOUND MULTIDIMENSIONAL ANSWER ABOUT YOUR QUESTION DEAR NHU, YOU ARE SHOWN MANY MEMORIES RELATED TO YOUR WAY OF ADVANCEMENT AND RELATED TO WHAT YOU HAVE GENERATED IN THE PAST WHERE YOU COULD BE TOO CONCENTRATE ON RESULT, MATTER, SUCCESS BECAUSE OF MATERIAL NEEDS (WESTERN MAN) AND AT THE SAME TIME, YOU ARE SHOWN A BEAUTIFUL SPIRITUAL POTENTIAL IN YOU THAT YOU COULD CONTINUE TO NURTURE THROUGH THE UNDERSTANDING OF DREAMS, YOU COULD CONTINUE TO ASK QUESTIONS IF YOU WISH... IT WILL GIVE MORE ANSWER ABOUT FINANCIAL NEEDS, NEED FOR RECOGNITION, TOO MUCH FOR A "COMFORTABLE LIFE" THAT DWELLS IN YOU... THIS DREAM GIVE YOU THE CAUSE AND SIMULTANEOUSLY THE CONSEQUENCE OF WANTING TO HAVE SUCCESS, WEALTH, ETC. ANGELIC EXPLORATION OF YOUR MEMORIES SO AS TO CREATE AN ANGELIC LIFE WITH NO LIMITATION IN THE EXPANSION OF YOUR POTENTIAL WITH ELEMIAH & VEHUEL ÂN

title_pdf: 04 Dream - Rest in boss s house. last case id: C0178. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 26 March 2021 Angel: 2 Jeliel Dream mood: Worry, Fear, Word hard, Comfortable, Interesting Dream and Analysis: ANGELIC HELLO NHU, As the guidance in the dream about breaking up with my boyfriend, I was guided to find out why I have memories of being infidelity. And I see you left name of 2 angels below are JELIEL & IEZALEL, I came across these 2 angels. I have chosen to mantra the angel Jeliel with the same question: Why do I attract infidelity? What memory in me created that? ITS A WONDERFUL STEP TO ASK ANSWERS FROM THE UP ABOVE AND THOSE QUESTIONS ARE OPENING UP THE MEMORIES WHICH NEED TO BE ADDRESSED, UNDERSTOOD SO AS TO BECOME AWARE PROGRESSIVELY OF CERTAIN LIMITATIONS, BLOCKAGES... I do not know what is the purpose of the 2 angels below each revision? YOU CAN LOOK INTO THE QUALITIES AND DISTORTIONS OF THE ANGELS WHOSE NAMES ARE MENTIONED IN THE DREAM REVISION. THIS HELPS YOU GET THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHICH QUALITIES YOU CAN DEVELOP AND WHICH DISTORTIONS YOU CAN BE AWARE OF. AND THESE 2 ANGELS AT THE END OF EACH DREAM ENTRY WILL GIVE YOU MORE UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE DREAM THAT YOU ANALYZE... This is a dream. In the evening, I and a female colleague have no place to rest, while tomorrow we have to go to work early with the boss (my current boss). So the boss told us to go to his home for a rest. SINCE IT'S THE EVENING IT SHOWS THAT YOU ARE GOING IN YOUR UNCONSCIOUS AND YOU SEE HOW YOU FEEL WHEN YOU TRY TO INTERIORIZE OR GO WITHIN, YOU MIGHT FEEL RESTLESS SOMETIMES AND MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO INTERIORIZE. This boss is a man. To me, he represents gentleness, dignity, respect for women and love for children, loyalty, loving family, cute, likeness, having experiences that I can learn at work, always have positive energy, joy, enthusiasm, hard work, effort at work. His minus in me is that deep within him is a hot-tempered, forgetful person, someone in the framework, not very good in expertise and leadership, not a capable person with good leadership for me to follow in the long run. I see that he doesn't care much about internal affairs, maybe because of trusting me too much, I sometimes find it difficult at work that I'm not to be helped, but I don't ask him much because I think he can't give me best answer. I often make my own decisions. THE BEGINNING OF THE DREAM SHOWS THAT HOW SOMETIMES YOU MANIFEST WITH THE RESTLESSNESS AND THE HELPLESSNESS WITHIN. YOUR PERCENTAGES OF INNER TURMOIL AND LACK OF LEADERSHIP AND CONFIDENCE CAN MAKE YOU FEEL HELPLESS, AND YOU MIGHT NOT FEEL CONFIDENT IN THE DECISIONS WHICH YOU MAKE, AS YOU SEEK VALIDATION FROM OUTSIDE. AND YOU ARE SHOWN THAT YOU HAVE DIFFICULTIES TO REST SINCE IN YOUR INNER STRUCTURE YOU COULD BE TOO EMISSIVE (BOSS WHO HAS A POWER OF DECISION IN THE COMPANY)), NOT ENOUGH RECEPTIVE TO TAKE TIME TO MEDITATE, INTERIORIZE... ->House (intimacy); The colleague and boss (social level/life): I don't care about my manifestation (boss) in social level a lot, I let the social level judge myself, make me can't in framework, can't develop skills to become a leader enough. HERE THE HOUSE OF THE BOSS SHOWS AN ASPECT OF YOUR INTIMACY, YOUR INNER WORLD. AS YOU DESCRIBED THE NEGATIVE OF THE BOSS ABOVE, IT IMPLIES THAT BEFORE MANIFESTING OR GOING OUT TO WORK WHAT KIND OF EMOTIONS, ATTITUDES, AND IDEAS YOU NOURISH WITHIN. This colleague who I do not know in real life, however, this week (before the dream takes place) my company has a new female employee working directly with the boss (as in dream), not on my team. However, I have not met and talked to her (after the dream I did not see her back to work, I do not know if she will quit her job or not). IT SHOWS AN ASPECT OF YOU THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW COMPLETELY YET, THIS PART OF YOU MAY HAVE THE TENDENCY TO QUIT THE DIFFICULTY WITHOUT THINKING OR WAITING FOR SOME TIME TO LEARN AND ACCOMMODATE GRADUALLY... I think his house is a block of houses about to be demolished , a bit old, a bit murky, L-shaped, 1 section has 1 floor, 1 section has 2 floors [- too emotional, old thoughts, old expression, old soul, need to be fixed ] In front of the house was a fairly large piece of land, filled with lush green weeds [+ sensitivity, gentleness, soothes the senses, unconditional love, regenerating emotional energy BUT HERE IT IS MORE THE NEGATIVE ASPECT, WHERE YOU WOULD LIKE TOO MUCH TO LIVE AN EXPANSION OF YOUR FEELING (LARGE PIECE OF LAND + GREEN WEEDS) WITH A DIFFICULTY TO BUILD YOUR INNER STRUCTURE... SO YOU ARE SHOWN MEMORIES WHERE YOU COULD FEEL PERCENTAGE OF DESTRUCTURATION IN YOU... AND AT THE SAME TIME IT IS NORMAL WHEN WE WORK ON OURSELVES, MANY OLD CONCEPTS ARE QUESTIONED... ] , sand, and stones from the house's dams. On the lawn, there were bricks (from his house, I guess) lined up to create a pathway to the house. THE OLD HOUSE SHOWS THE ANCIENT PATTERNS IN YOU. YOU ARE NOW REACHING TO THE PATTERNS IN YOU WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN KNOWN TO YOU BEFORE. SINCE IT A DOUBLE-STOREY HOUSE, IT SHOWS HOW YOU THINK AND ACTS OUT WITH YOUR OLD PATTERNS. WEEDS ARE PLANTS THAT ARE A BIT INVASIVE AND CAN GROW ANYWHERE. SOMETIMES IF WEEDS ARE MORE, THEY CAN HAMPER THE GROWTH OF THE PLANTS WHICH ONE IS TRYING TO GROW. SAND IS RELATED TO THE EARTH ELEMENT, IT SHOWS THE UNCONSCIOUS ACTIONS FROM THE PAST WHICH ARE COMING FROM THE ANCIENT PATTERNS OF BEING (SANDS AND STONE). SO WHEN YOU ARE FEELING HELPLESS, FEARFUL, DOUBTFUL WITHIN, YOU CAN THEN FEEL ANGRY AND MAY NOT FEEL STABLE IN YOUR INNER WORLD. ->I have old, long-standing, somewhat conservative thoughts that refuse to change, so my soul is destroyed INVITED TO RENEW YOUR OLD AND UNCONSCIOUS STRUCTURE by these old things, AND RECYCLE THESE OLD STRUCTURES OF YOUR INTIMACY RELATED TO OVER-EMISSIVITY, ANGER (HOT-TEMPERED), DIFFICULTY TO TAKE CARE OF OTHERS, DIFFICULTY TO DEVELOP EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE... which are gradually being destroyed SO AS TO BUILD A NEW ANGELIC STRUCTURE IN YOU. Although I still feel that I am a positive person trying to change, my soul is too old. It needs beating and rebuilding WITH THE ANGELIC CODE We kept going straight, but I looked to the left, and see an easier path, I headed in that direction. After I walked a bit, my boss disapproved, I didn't know whether he is angry or joking but hearing the voice, I felt that the tone was a bit angry. He said something like: going over there cannot be in the house. Why go that side? Come over to this side. I changed my way. SOMETIMES YOU CAN BYPASS THE DIFFICULT WAY OVER THE EASIER WAY. YOUR INNER BOSS, I.E YOUR ACTION/EMISSIVE ASPECT IS DIRECTING YOU TO GO THROUGH THE STRUCTURE OF YOUR INTIMACY SO THAT YOU CAN RECOGNIZE WHAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED IN YOU. SO SOMETIMES IN THE SOCIAL LEVEL, EVEN IF YOU ARE GUIDED RIGHTLY YOU MAY FEEL THAT YOU ARE BEING FORCED, BUT IF YOU ARE ABLE TO CLEANSE THOSE MEMORIES, YOU CAN ANALYZE AND EVALUATE WHAT IS RIGHT OR NOT BEFORE COMING TO ACTION ->The social level makes me do things that I don't want. However, I still follow the social level because I think it is also right and makes sense. BUT SOMEHOW YOU COULD BE TOO SOCIAL, LACK OF LEADERSHIP, HAVING DIFFICULTIES TO FIND THE BEST IDEAS POSSIBLE OF EVERYONE... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... We went in front of a dark room, right in the corner of the letter L. A person came out, I was introduced as the boss's father (this person I know in real life, this is the grandfather of my close friend). In real life, he is a famous painter. He is knowledgeable, intelligent, artistic, uplifting, romantic, with foresight. On the contrary, he is a fastidious, perfectionist. Part of me has not been in contact with him so much that I have not seen many minus points in him. He wondered who the two of us were. He looked annoyed. I saw him familiar and I asked him if he missed me = % OF EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES. Then he turned on the light, put on his glasses, and looked at me, but he still didn't recognize me. He was angry, he said: he does not know you all, why do you appear and be friendly with him. He reminded my boss that these are strangers, be careful with them. THE BOSS'S FATHER REPRESENTS YOUR ANCIENT MEMORIES OF EMISSIVITY AND YOU ARE SHOWN WHY YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PLACE TO REST AT THE BEGINNING... IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE DIFFICULTY TO INTERIORIZE SINCE YOU COULD BE TOO EMISSIVE AND BE OVER-PERFECTIONIST, TOO FASTIDIOUS.... AND THESE ARE UNCONSCIOUS PATTERNS IN YOU, THESE PATTERNS MAKE YOU FEEL THE PRESSURE TO PERFORM AND GET RESULTS, DOING WHICH YOU MAY SOMETIMES BECOME HARSH WITH YOURSELF AND THEN, ON THE 23/07/2025, 11:03 Rest in boss's house | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/79677 2/4 CONTRARY, TO ESCAPE THESE PATTERNS IN YOU, YOU ACT OUT WITH THE LACK OF MOTIVATION, LAXITY, ETC. SO YOU SEE HERE NHU, THESE ARE THE TWO EXTREME PATTERNS EITHER PERFECTIONISM OR LAXITY, EITHER FASTIDIOUSNESS OR LACK OF MOTIVATION. My boss just stood behind and smiled. Now I remember that he was old and forgetful person. (in real life this grandfather also had this disease, but every time he met me, he remembered me). I feel comfortable with this thought about him, though I have a little fear at first. THE TENDENCY TO ESCAPE YOUR MEMORIES, PAINS, ORDEALS, ETC CAN SOMETIMES CREATE FORGETFULNESS IN YOU,BUT PROGRESSIVELY YOUR WORK ON YOURSELF WITH THE DREAMS AND ANGELS IS HELPING YOU TO IDENTIFY AND TRANSCEND SUCH MEMORIES... ->I was afraid, I was overwhelmed and panicked by discovering old memories, distortions, negative sides within me that I had never seen. But I've faced it, I've come to accept it. YES, NOW GRADUALLY YOU ARE GETTING EQUIPPED TO FACE THESE MEMORIES AND ACCEPT AND UNDERSTAND THEM... After that, my boss asked for permission to take the two of us upstairs to rest. SO WHEN FACED WITH THE OLD PATTERNS IN YOU, YOU CHOOSE TO INTELLECTUALIZE MORE (UPSTAIRS) AND ESCAPE FROM THE DISCOMFORT YOU FEEL IN MATTER . INSTEAD OF TAKING THE RIGHT ACTION, YOU MAY CHOOSE TO REST AND ESCAPE FROM THE PROBLEM... ->I still know that I have memories inside me about infidelity, but I don't know exact memories through this dream. I see 3, 1 man and 2 women. All the 3 of us accompany together. No one leaves. What should I do about this? And how can I clean this memory or heal myself from infidelity? IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU COULD SEE INFIDELITY IN A LARGER PERSPECTIVE... IN THE SPIRITUAL LEVEL, INFIDELITY MEANS THAT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE DIFFICULTIES TO FOLLOW YOUR PRINCIPLES... AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PRINCIPLES WE COULD MAKE A PARALLEL WITH A COUNTRY THAT HAS A CONSTITUTION... RULES TO RESPECT SO AS TO PROMOTE PROSPERITY... AND FOR A HUMAN IT IS THE SAME WE HAVE ALL OUR PRINCIPLES AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T RESPECT THEIR OWN POSITIVE VALUES AND IT BECOMES ALSO A NOTION OF INFIDELITY... IN ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE, YOU ARE SHOWN IN YOUR DREAM THAT YOU HAVE OLD PATTERNS OF HAVING DIFFICULTIES IN RELATIONSHIP (LACK OF LEADERSHIP), HAVING DIFFICULTIES TO INTERIORIZE, TO TAKE TIME FOR YOURSELF BECAUSE OF PERCENTAGE IN YOU WHERE YOU COULD BE TOO MUCH IN THE SOCIAL LEVEL, BECAUSE OF OLD PATTERNS WHERE YOU COULD REPRESS CERTAIN MEMORIES, BECAUSE OF HAVING ANGER AND THESE MEMORIES COULD EVENTUALLY CREATE LACK OF LOVE INSIDE... THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO COMPENSATE... AND INFIDELITY IS ONE OF THE WAYS OF COMPENSATION FOR SOME PEOPLE... AND YOU WILL SEE HOW WONDERFUL IT IS TO SEE THOSE PATTERNS IN DREAM SO AS TO REPROGRAM GRADUALLY MEMORIES... AND AFTER OBSERVING THOSE MEMORIES IN YOU, YOU COULD TAKE A MOMENT TO MEDITATE, TO INTERIORIZE, TO INVOKE AN ANGEL TO CONCENTRATE YOUR INTENTION SO AS TO CHANGE CERTAIN THOUGHTS, EMOTIONS, BEHAVIORS WITH SELF-COMPASSION AND PATIENCE... On the previous dream "break up with my boyfriend", you asked me to make a list of what is already good in my life to have a road map of my life. DEAR NHU, THIS DREAM GIVES YOU THE KEY TO THE REASONS BEHIND YOUR LACK OF MOTIVATION AND LAXITY WHICH YOU FACE IN YOUR LIFE, AND THE REASON WHY SOMETIMES YOU ACT WITH TOO MUCH EMISSIVITY. YOUR INNER GRANDFATHER ENERGY WHO IS A PERFECTIONIST DOES NOT LET YOU FEEL AT PEACE FOR YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THEN YOU CAN ACT LIKE YOUR BOSS (INNER BOSS), WITH THE ENERGY OF HOT TEMPER, FORGETFULNESS, AND LACK OF LEADERSHIP. YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL ABOUT YOUR INNER PERFECTIONIST WHO DRAINS AWAY THE ENERGY OF ENTHUSIASM FROM YOU AND THUS MAKES YOU FEEL DE-MOTIVATED AND HELPLESS. AND YOU ARE AT THE RIGHT PLACE TO CREATE A BEAUTIFULBALANCE IN YOUR LIFE WITH PERSEVERANCE DEAR INITIATE In the past, when I was in a too negative state, I could not find anything good. But now, I have some: 1. I still alive 2. My dad helped me convince my mom to pay the owe for me. I am really grateful to my dad at this moment. And he can understand what I am going through, not at all but it also made me feel more comforted and less lonely. 3. I still breathe, see the plants, nature every day. I can work again, thing by thing, not good as before, but I can work with colleagues, I have new friends, I can meet and talk to people. 4. I have love experience. 5.

    "dream_text": "In the evening, I and a female colleague have no place to rest, while tomorrow we have to go to work early with the boss. So the boss told us to go to his home for a rest. This boss is a man. To me, he represents gentleness, dignity, respect for women and love for children, loyalty, loving family, cute, likeness, having experiences that I can learn at work, always have positive energy, joy, enthusiasm, hard work, effort at work. His minus in me is that deep within him is a hot-tempered, forgetful person, someone in the framework, not very good in expertise and leadership, not a capable person with good leadership for me to follow in the long run. I see that he doesn't care much about internal affairs, maybe because of trusting me too much, I sometimes find it difficult at work that I'm not to be helped, but I don't ask him much because I think he can't give me best answer. I often make my own decisions. This colleague who I do not know in real life, however, this week (before the dream takes place) my company has a new female employee working directly with the boss (as in dream), not on my team. However, I have not met and talked to her (after the dream I did not see her back to work, I do not know if she will quit her job or not). I think his house is a block of houses about to be demolished , a bit old, a bit murky, L-shaped, 1 section has 1 floor, 1 section has 2 floors. In front of the house was a fairly large piece of land, filled with lush green weeds, sand, and stones from the house's dams. On the lawn, there were bricks (from his house, I guess) lined up to create a pathway to the house. Although I still feel that I am a positive person trying to change, my soul is too old. It needs beating and rebuilding WITH THE ANGELIC CODE. We kept going straight, but I looked to the left, and see an easier path, I headed in that direction. After I walked a bit, my boss disapproved, I didn't know whether he is angry or joking but hearing the voice, I felt that the tone was a bit angry. He said something like: going over there cannot be in the house. Why go that side? Come over to this side. I changed my way. We went in front of a dark room, right in the corner of the letter L. A person came out, I was introduced as the boss's father (this person I know in real life, this is the grandfather of my close friend). In real life, he is a famous painter. He is knowledgeable, intelligent, artistic, uplifting, romantic, with foresight. On the contrary, he is a fastidious, perfectionist. Part of me has not been in contact with him so much that I have not seen many minus points in him. He wondered who the two of us were. He looked annoyed. I saw him familiar and I asked him if he missed me. Then he turned on the light, put on his glasses, and looked at me, but he still didn't recognize me. He was angry, he said: he does not know you all, why do you appear and be friendly with him. He reminded my boss that these are strangers, be careful with them. Now I remember that he was old and forgetful person. I feel comfortable with this thought about him, though I have a little fear at first. After that, my boss asked for permission to take the two of us upstairs to rest. I still know that I have memories inside me about infidelity, but I don't know exact memories through this dream. I see 3, 1 man and 2 women. All of the 3 of us accompany together. No one leaves.",

title_pdf: 05 Dream - Eating fast food together. last case id: C0179. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 2 April 2021 Angel: 36 Menadel Dream mood: Affair, Surprise, Enjoy, Satisfied Dream and Analysis: HELLO DEAR NHU, I mantra Angel 36 Menadel with the question: Should I take this part-time job? We have 4 people: I, my sister, Nhu (my staff) and Giang (my colleague). This is my first sister. She is an intelligent, good person, loves children, generous and comfortable. But she is also a fastidious, hot-tempered person. There is a personality from my mother that all three of my sisters (I have 2 sisters) have when growing up, that is when we hear something pleasing to us, we will shout first, even cursing, denying it before thinking about what it is, it's quite annoying. I've realized I have this personality over the past few years and I've been working on fixing it. My sister associated with me a haunting period of 3 years in high school. During these years, she was very upset with me when I was away from home from school, and my mother made her take care of me. While, maybe my sister didn't want it either, and I didn't want it either. Because our sisters are not close. During this time, she was very annoyed with me, after a period of enduring, I became afraid of her, I was so scared that I could not look her in the eye when talking, I also did not talk with her a lot. When I think of her time, I just feel scared and angry. Now, I have gradually transformed this obsession, I am more comfortable meeting her and talking more, but still just ordinary stories that are not too close. I made a distance with her by not living in the same house and met little so that when we meet, we will still be happy and talk. I feel that she and I are completely unsuitable when we live in the same house or we don't have the same opinion when chatting. Nhu is my employee, I once dreamed of her in the dream 'lost'. She is smart, scientific, personality, friendly, future leader, kind, funny, grateful and has a clear purpose in life, hard work. She is a bit emotional. I can't think of her minus. Maybe I was too focused on her positives, but she is indeed a very nice person. Giang is my colleague. She is a woman who is knowledgeable in many fields. About life, she has many profound experiences, is gifted with aesthetics, skillful in hand, good at speaking, friendly, cheerful, enthusiastic, and has the ability to connect people together. On the minus point, she is judgmental and has a bit of disdain, disrespect for others, a rather large ego, less receptive opinion about areas she thinks she is good at, likes to express herself a bit too much. Before, during a team meeting, she had bluntly evaluated me and showed me disrespect in front of everyone. While I do not care about her opinions or thoughts about me, I just focus on solving work. After that, I simply worked with her and didn't show my private life with her like before, I kept my distance. SINCE HERE 4 WOMEN ARE PRESENT, THIS SHOWS THE BASIC FOUNDATION OF YOUR INNER WORLD. IT SHOWS HOW YOU FEEL, THINK AND MANAGE YOUR EMOTIONS WHEN YOU ARE AT THE WORKPLACE. SINCE THE DREAM IS NOT POSITIVE YOU CAN RELATE TO THE MINUS OF THE PEOPLE ABOUT WHOM YOU HAVE WRITTEN ABOVE. THIS WILL HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RESONANCES BUT ALSO THE QUALITIES THAT DWELLS IN YOU... AND THAT YOU HAVE ATTRACTED THROUGH YOUR POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE MEMORIES... We were going to have a meal at a small fast food store in the supermarket. HERE IF WE LOOK AT THE NEGATIVE OF THE SUPERMARKET, IT IS RELATED TO FEAR OF LACK, FOCUS ON MONEY, SOMEONE WHO IS CONTROLLED BY NEEDS AND INSTINCTS My sister and I thought that 1 burger for each one is enough. However, Giang said she hungry. Then, she ordered 2 pieces of chicken more: 1 for her, 1 for others. FAST FOOD IS RELATED TO NOURISH YOUR INSTINCTUAL NEEDS RAPIDLY BUT MAY NOT BE GOOD FOR OUR WELLBEING..... FOOD IS SYMBOLIC OF THE EMOTIONS AND THE THOUGHTS THAT YOU NOURISH YOURSELF WITH. SO IN THE SOCIAL LEVEL OR WHILE YOU ARE AT WORK, YOU MAY TRY TO NOURISH YOUR INSTINCTUAL NEEDS (ANIMALS) AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU ARE NOURISHING AN ASPECT IN YOU THAT IS TOO DOWN-TO-EARTH, TOO FOCUS ON MATTER, TOO FOCUS ON RESULTS (CHICKEN)... AND THE CHICKEN IS A BIRD THAT CANNOT FLY... SO IT WILL TOUCH YOUR THOUGHTS (AIR) THAT COULD BE TOO CONCENTRATE ON YOUR OWN NEEDS... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... Fast food [- too fast, too many energies, too attentive to expression, too enthusiastic YES... AND YOU CAN COMPLETE WITH COMMENTS ABOVE :-)... ] -> I focus too much on reception (femininity) on work, I don't feedback or express outside -> depress. YES, YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF UNABLE TO EXPRESS WITH PEACE AND CONFIDENCE BECAUSE OF THE CONFLICTING THOUGHTS INSIDE After that, Han comes. Han is my boss. She is younger than me but she's pretty good at work. She is delicate, insightful, intelligent, well-organized, and well- executed. She also studies spirituality, spends time with herself, loves herself, is a perfectionist. She is good at diplomacy, knows how to need it. An excellent woman. Besides, to me, she doesn't have good lead and teamwork skills. Han ordered a meal for her and added 3 pieces of chicken for everyone. So each person has an extra piece of chicken. SO YOU SEE HERE HOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO NOURISH YOUR INSTINCTUAL NEEDS... AND YOU HAVE YOUR ANSWER ABOUT THE PART-TIME JOB... YOU ARE SHOWN THAT YOU COULD BE TOO FOCUS ON YOUR NEEDS BEHIND THE INTENTION TO HAVE A PART-TIME JOB... UP ABOVE ARE SHOWING YOU THAT YOU HAVE INSECURITIES, MEMORIES OF BEING TOO DOWN-TO-EARTH (MATERIALISTIC) IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... THAT YOU CAN AMPLIFY IN YOU WHEN YOU HAVE A POWER OF DECISION... (BOSS WHO IS BUYING MORE CHICKEN)... -> When I go to spirituality deeper, I can balance the energy and perceptions on work, on the way of advance HERE IT IS MORE THE NEGATIVE ASPECT... AND IF SHE REPRESENTS A SPIRITUAL PERSON FOR YOU, IT MEANS THAT YOU CAN NOURISH THOSE INSTINCTUAL NEEDS PROFOUNDLY IN YOUR MEMORIES... BECAUSE SPIRITUALITY MEANS THAT IT TOUCHES THE CORE OF WHO YOU ARE... When Giang ordered 2 more, I thought it was redundant. At this point, a part of me doesn't take Giang's opinion seriously and doesn't care what she means, whatever she does. But when Han bought 3 pieces of chicken, I realized this shortcoming and thought that now it was enough for everyone to eat. Maybe I respect Han's opinion and know she will make the right decisions so I look at myself. THIS SCENE SHOWS A LACK OF DISCERNMENT... BECAUSE WHEN YOUR INNER GIANG IS ORDERING SOMETHING YOU DON'T REALLY AGREE BUT WHEN IT IS ANOTHER PERSON THAT YOU ESTEEM MORE OR WHO HAS POWER OF DECISION (BOSS) YOU CAN START TO LISTEN... SO IT MEANS THAT IN YOUR AFFIRMATION YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR POINT OF VIEW DEPENDING ON THE PERSON AND NOT DEPENDING ON THE IDEA IF IT IS RIGHT FOR YOUR EVOLUTION OR NOT... SO REGARDING THE PART-TIME JOB, DEPENDING ON THE PERCENTAGES OF THESE MEMORIES, YOU CAN EVENTUALLY LISTEN TO A PERSON'S ADVICE BASED ON THE PERSON WHO ADVICES INSTEAD OF THE IDEA IN ITSELF... BECAUSE ONE DAY WHEN WE ARE A GOOD LEADER, WE TAKE THE BEST IDEAS FROM EVERYONE... -> At work, I still lack respect for people and evaluate others according to my subjective opinion. This blocked my reception at work, causing my skills to not be expressed properly and sufficiently. I need to slow down and become deeper at work, observe more (Han), and learn more to receive and respond to the right work. When I am in balance, I can get the part-time job that I am wondering. AND IT IS ALSO A BEAUTIFUL INVITATION TO DEVELOP MORE DISCERNMENT... WHETHER YOU WOULD LIKE THIS PART-TIME JOB OUT OF INSECURITIES, NEEDS, OR WITH THE INTENTION TO DISCOVER YOURSELF, TO DEVELOP CERTAIN QUALITIES, TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON...SO YOU CAN BE AWARE TO NOT ALLOW JUDGMENTAL THOUGHTS OR EGO TO BLUR YOUR GLOBAL VISION... On the previous dream "Rest in boss's house" and last dreams, I received your explain but I don't think I can really understand the key of dream and I don't know what next to do or what I should do to clean the distortions. FOR THE KEY SYMBOLS OF THE DREAM, YOU WILL PROGRESSIVELY UNDERSTAND HOW EACH SYMBOL INTERACTS TOGETHER... HERE IS AN EXAMPLE: We were going to have a meal at a small fast food store in the supermarket (PUTTING THE STYLE SYMBOL) AND THEN YOU COULD PUT THE APPROPRIATE STYLE, NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE [- Fast food is a notion of nourishing instinctual needs in a fast way that could affect thoughts, emotions because of the food that are often unhealthy and the supermarket in the negative aspect is related 23/07/2025, 11:05 Eating fast food together | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/80185 2/4 to an activation of needs in the social level, difficulties to manage well the budget, difficulty to exchange in the social level, to have access resources, etc. ] HERE IS AN EXAMPLE SO AS TO HELP YOU TO GO DEEPER INTO YOUR DREAM... AND AFTER YOUR DREAM, YOU CAN TAKE TIME TO REFLECT ON THIS DREAM, TO SEE WHERE THOSE MEMORIES SHOWN IN THE DREAM CAN APPEAR IN YOUR CONCRETE REALITY, IN YOUR THOUGHTS, EMOTIONS OR BEHAVIORS...DREAMS ARE THERE SO AS WE CAN DISCOVER OUR POTENTIAL BUT ALSO TO BE AWARE OF OUR DISTORTIONS... SO AS TO TRANSFORM OUR NEGATIVE THOUGHTS, EMOTIONS AND BEHAVIOR... FOR E.G WHEN YOU FEEL YOU ARE SOMETIMES TOO MUCH IN SOCIAL LEVEL, IT CAN CREATE A DIFFICULTY TO INTERIORIZE... AND BY KNOWING THAT, YOU CAN EVENTUALLY CHANGE HABIT... SINCE YOU WILL KNOW THAT A PERIOD OF INTERIORIZATION IS GOOD FOR YOU IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU CAN COMPENSATE IN THE SOCIAL LEVEL AT TIMES... THE DREAMS ARE ALSO SHOWING THE CONSEQUENCES OF CERTAIN MEMORIES... FOR EXAMPLE, IF SOMEONE IS OFTEN COMPENSATING IN THE SOCIAL LEVEL, BEING OUTSIDE, AND NOT TAKING ENOUGH TIME TO MEDITATE, INTERIORIZE, IT CREATES EVENTUALLY LACK OF LOVE, EMPTINESS AND THIS LACK OF LOVE, EMPTINESS CAN CREATE CONSEQUENCES... SO TO CHANGE NEGATIVE HABITS, YOU CAN CHOOSE AN ANGEL THAT IS LINKED TO WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE... THEN WITH THE INTENTION OF CLEANSING YOUR DISTORTIONS, YOU CAN CHANT THE NAME OF THE ANGEL WITH THE INTENTION TO CHANGE NEGATIVE PATTERNS, WITH THE INTENTION TO BECOME BETTER SO AS TO PROGRESSIVELY LIVE HARMONY IN YOUR LIFE... WHILE YOU ARE UNDERSTANDING YOURSELF MORE AND MORE... . AND THIS CHANTING HELPS IN REACHING THE STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS REPRESENTED BY THE PARTICULAR ANGEL. AS WE GRADUALLY START TO TRANSCEND THE DISTORTIONS AS A NATURAL PROCESS WE START TO IMBIBE THE QUALITIES OF THAT ANGEL BECAUSE WE BECOME WHAT WE REPEAT... Eg: I have "old patterns of having difficulties in relationship (lack of leadership), having difficulties to interiorize, to take time for yourself because of percentage in you where you could be too much in the social level, because of old patterns where you could repress certain memories, because of having anger and these memories could eventually create lack of love inside"... -> I am confused with the distortions and it is not clear what memory actually causes it. And what should I do with it? IT IS A BEAUTIFUL QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED DEAR NHU... IN THE PREVIOUS DREAM, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE LACK OF LOVE AS A ONE OF THE ROOT CAUSE OF INFIDELITY... INFIDELITY IS ABOUT LOOKING OUTSIDE WHAT IT IS MISSING INSIDE... AND THE PREVIOUS DREAM IS EXPLAINING WHY YOU CAN INDUCE THIS LACK OF LOVE... IT IS BECAUSE THERE ARE NEGATIVE MEMORIES INSIDE, SUCH AS OLD MEMORIES (OLD STRUCTURE OF THE HOUSE) THAT YOU HAVE KEPT FOR A CERTAIN MOMENT... SUCH AS ANGER, BEING BOSSY, REJECTING OTHERS (GRAND-FATHER), SUCH AS "NO HOUSE TO REST" AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DREAM... IMAGINE IN THE CONCRETE REALITY TO HAVE NO HOUSE TO RETURN HOME, IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO TAKE TIME TO REGENERATE YOUR ENERGY, TO TAKE TIME FOR YOURSELF TO MEDITATE SO THIS ASPECT ALSO COULD CREATE A LACK OF LOVE INSIDE... BECAUSE MEDITATION IS A PROFOUND WAY TO REGENERATE OUR INTENTION OF LOVE, TO GENERATE A GOOD INTENTION WHILE WE ARE MANIFESTING OURSELVES... AND ANGER, MATERIALISTIC NEEDS, INSECURITIES, BEING TOO PERFECTIONIST ETC, HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT THAT CREATES LACK OF LOVE INSIDE... SO THE DREAM IS SHOWING HOW THE MEMORIES ARE INTERACTING INSIDE OF YOU AND HOW IT CAN LEAD TO CERTAIN THOUGHTS, EMOTIONS, AND BEHAVIORS IN THE CONCRETE REALITY... DEPENDING ON THE PERCENTAGE OF MEMORIES... Beside, I don't understand about "the key to the reasons behind your lack of motivation and laxity which you face in your life, and the reason why sometimes you act with too much emissivity". I can understand that I have the grandfather inner, perfectionist makes me lack of leader and motivation while I can't fulfilling the desires of this personality within me. LIFE IS REALLY ABOUT EQUILIBRIUM... SO WHEN THERE IS A "TOO MUCH" SOMEWHERE, IT IS BECAUSE THERE IS A "NOT ENOUGH" AND THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE ALSO.... SOMETIMES YOU CAN FEEL A LACK OF MOTIVATION, AND LAZINESS IN CERTAIN ASPECTS OF YOUR LIFE BECAUSE, IN OTHER ASPECTS OF YOUR LIFE, YOU CAN BE TOO PERFECTIONIST... SO WHEN YOU HAVE TOO MUCH EMISSIVITY SOMEWHERE, IT IS BECAUSE THERE ARE MEMORIES WHERE YOU WERE NOT ENOUGH EMISSIVE... AND THIS STATEMENT IS VALID FOR EVERYTHING, IF WE LIKE SOMETHING TOO MUCH, IT MEANS THAT THERE IS A LACK SOMEWHERE... AND TO DEEPEN THIS ASPECT OF BEING TOO PERFECTIONIST, WHEN YOU ACT AS A NEGATIVE PERFECTIONIST IT TAKES AWAY THE JOY OF DOING THE TASK AT THE MOMENT, THAT IS WHY IN SUCH MOMENTS, IT IS GOOD TO TAKE TIME TO RETURN IN YOUR "METAPHYSICAL HOME" TO MEDITATE... SO AS TO PUT A GOOD INTENTION INSTEAD OF HAVING THIS UNSATISFIED PERFECTIONIST THAT CAN LEAD YOUR ACTIONS... THAT BEING SAID, BEING PERFECTIONIST CAN BE VERY POSITIVE... IT IS A MATTER OF INTENTION. IN THE NEGATIVE ASPECT, BEING OVER-PERFECTIONIST CAN CREATE FRUSTRATIONS, ANGER, IMPATIENCE, LACK OF LOVE BUT IF IT IS POSITIVE, IT CREATES REFINEMENT IN OUR QUALITIES, SATISFACTION OF OUR SOUL TO DO THE RIGHT THINGS, POSITIVE SELF-ESTEEM, BEING POSITIVELY PRIDE OF OURSELVES, ETC. You also mentioned "you should be careful about your inner perfectionist who drains away the energy of enthusiasm from you" -> what should I do with this? I should reduce my perfectionist? And I need to have more reception? YOU CAN COMPLETE WITH COMMENTS ABOVE... AS SAID ABOVE, PERFECTIONISM COULD BE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE DEPENDING ON THE INTENTION... AND IF YOU HAVE THE INTENTION TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON, TO DO YOUR BEST WHILE YOU ARE DETACH FROM THE RESULT, IT WILL CREATE A PROFOUND SATISFACTION... INSTEAD OF BEING UNSATISFIED AND FORCING IN MATTER TO ABSOLUTELY GET A RESULT... AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS IMPORTANT TO MEDITATE BECAUSE MEDITATION DEEPENS THE FORCE OF OUR INTENTION... AND YES... RECEPTIVITY IS ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND TOOL TO MEDITATE, TO UNDERSTAND OUR UNCONSCIOUS, TO RECEIVE INTUITION, GUIDANCE, AND DREAMS... IT IS BEAUTIFUL TO FEEL YOUR GREAT MOTIVATION TO UNDERSTAND YOURSELF EACH WEEK... I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE YOUR EFFORTS WITH A SENSE OF ACCEPTANCE OF YOURSELF WITH CLEMENCY AND WISDOM 23/07/2025, 11:05 Eating fast food together | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/80185 3/4 WITH VASARIAH AND LECABEL ÂN

PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 9 April 2021 Angel: 49 Vehuel Dream and Analysis: ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU, This week, I continue doing my part-time job and maybe I don't really focus on chant the Angel, and I also don't remember any dreams. I chant Angel 49 with the question: why do I too focus on matter? IT IS A PROFOUND QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED, NHU... AND BEING TOO FOCUS ON MATTER DEPENDS ON MEMORIES OF EACH PERSON... AND YOU HAD YOUR ANSWER IN THE FOLLOWING SHARING... BUT IN GENERAL, BEING TOO FOCUS ON MATTER IS RELATED TO A LACK OF SPIRITUALITY... AND WHEN WE SAY SPIRITUALITY, IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO BE DETACHED FROM MATTER AND BEING ABLE TO INFUSE THE RIGHT INTENTION IN OUR ACTIONS... FOCUSSING ON MATTER IS NOT WRONG IF WE HAVE THE RIGHT INTENTION, A SPIRITUAL INTENTION, WHERE WE ARE DETACH FROM MATTER... IT MEANS THAT WE DO OUR BEST BUT WE DON'T LOOK JUST FOR THE RESULT, WE ACCEPT THE RESULT KNOWING THAT THE RESULT DEPENDS ON THE UNIVERSE SINCE WE HAVE DONE OUR BEST...BUT IT IS TRUE THAT IF WE ARE OVER-FOCUS ON MATTER IT CAN CREATE DISTURBANCES, FRUSTRATIONS, ANGER, SADNESS, ETC. AND EVENTUALLY BEING TOO FOCUS ON MATTER CAN MAKE PEOPLE LOSE THEIR RECEPTIVITY TO WHAT IS RIGHT... TOWARDS THE PLAN OF THE UNIVERSE... AND DREAMS CAN GIVE THE ANSWERS AS TO WHAT YOU CAN BE AWARE OF WHEN YOU FOCUS ON MATTER. UP ABOVE HELPS US KNOW OUR DEEPER INTENTIONS, AND GRADUALLY AND PROGRESSIVELY WE CAN OPERATE WITH THE RIGHT INTENTION AND SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE SO THAT WE MANIFEST WITH THE RIGHT ENERGY. AND OF COURSE, WE DON'T NEED TO BE PERFECT, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DO IT STEP BY STEP WHILE YOU CAN DEVELOP JOY IN THIS SPIRITUAL JOURNEY... I just want to ask about some of my present expressions. Sometimes, when I talk to some friends, my nose gets very itchy. I don't know if I have a nose disease, but it only itches when I talk, other times it's normal. Recently, when I was talking to a friend about my dream knowledge, the symbol that I was learning to heal, my nose was itchy. I kept scratching it. -> nose: related to the air (thoughts), I think maybe I still haven't clear on my mind, I have too many thoughts that conflict. So I have problems when I speak out it out. They are not identical. YES, IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD... AND THE NOSE IS ALSO RELATED TO COMMUNICATION AS IT ALSO HELPS WITH PHONATION. IT IS ALSO RELATED TO THE CAPACITY TO SENSE AND FEEL IN OUR INNER WORLD. YES, YOU MAY HAVE CONFLICTING THOUGHTS WHILE YOU SPEAK AND THE ITCHING HELPS YOU TO TAKE A MOMENT AND RETHINK WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO SPEAK. AND THE ITCHES ARE ALSO RELATED TO MEMORIES THAT EMERGE FROM YOUR UNCONSCIOUS... AND THE NOSE IS ALSO RELATED TO THE FIRST CHAKRA, RELATED TO OUR INSTINCTINCTUAL ENERGY, NEEDS... SO YOU SEE WHEN YOU MAKE A LINK WITH YOUR QUESTION ABOVE, YOU CAN BE ALSO TOO FOCUS ON RESULT, ON MATTER, BECAUSE OF INSTINCTUAL NEEDS... AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT INSTINCTUAL NEEDS, WE TALK ABOUT THE FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF OUR SURVIVAL... THAT WE CAN FULFILL POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY... Besides, I feel cold inside, especially in my brain. It is normally very cold. I feel like there's always a thick ice sheet around my brain, cold and numb. THE COLD IS RELATED TO THE FROZEN EMOTIONS, IT IS RELATED TO THE MEMORIES MARKED BY LACK OF LOVE. THERE ARE MEMORIES RELATED TO THE EMOTIONAL COLDNESS IN THE COLLECTIVE, SO WHEN YOU ARE OUTSIDE, INTERACTING WITH THE PEOPLE THESE MEMORIES GET TRIGGERED. When I need to think a lot, my head hurts, especially at work IT COULD BE BECAUSE OF MANY THOUGHTS AT ONCE IN YOUR MIND. IT'S LIKE A COMPUTER WITH MANY PROGRAMS RUNNING AT ONCE AND THUS THE COMPUTER GETS HANGED. THEN EITHER THE PROGRAMS NEED TO BE OPENED/CLOSED AT THE RIGHT MOMENTOR THE COMPUTER NEEDS TO BE RESTARTED OR UPDATING THE CAPACITY OF THE COMPUTER :-). AND IF YOU HAVE HEADACHE IT IS BECAUSE YOU CAN BE OVER- EMISSIVE AT TIMES... YOU CAN FORCE YOURSELF TO THINK... AND IT CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOU ARE TOO FOCUS ON MATTER, ON RESULT... AND ONE DAY, WE CAN THINK FAST AND A LOT WITHOUT HAVING HEADACHE :-) AND TAKE A MOMENT TO REST THE THOUGHTS WITH A DEEP BREATHE, A GLASS OF WATER FOR A FEW MINUTE SO AS TO RESTART WITH A RENEWED ENERGY... The intensity of work and the specifics of work make me need to brainstorm a lot, so at first, I feel both painful and cold. Not only that, I just talk to the people around, I need to think about what I heard, I also had a headache. And after each time, it took me some time to rest, to calm my brain to start over. WE HAVE COMPASSION FOR YOU, FOR WHAT YOU ARE FACING, NHU. YOU CAN GRADUALLY INCULCATE THE HABIT OF MEDITATING EACH DAY FOR SOMETIMES.... 20 MINUTES IS RECOMMENDED... AND YOU DON'T NEED TO DO 20 MINUTES AT ONCE, YOU CAN MEDITATE FOR 5 MINUTES FEW TIMES A DAY. THIS WILL HELP YOU REMAIN CALM AND CENTERED THROUGHOUT THE DAY. ALSO, YOU CAN TRY DOING SOME BREATHING EXERCISES WHICH WILL HELP YOU TO CALM YOUR MIND AND MANAGE THE NUMBER OF THOUGHTS. THE CALM BREATH MAKES THE MIND CALM, WHILE RESTLESS BREATHING TRIGGERS RESTLESSNESS IN THE MIND. But in reality, it is normally always cold. It is related to my emotions. My emotion was frozen. So maybe I can't feel the emotion in life too. So far, when I discover my problem, I start to heal, change my thought, I feel better a little, but my brain still feels cold. IT IS BEAUTIFUL THAT YOU NOTICE A CHANGE IN YOU...IT'S A GOOD STEP TO CHANGE YOUR THOUGHTS AND THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF THINKING POSITIVELY WHILE TRANSFORMING NEGATIVITY..., AND TO REACH A STATE OF CONSTANT PEACE, IT REQUIRES EFFORTS AND TIME, AND YOU ARE BEAUTIFULLY DOING YOUR EFFORTS TO HEAL YOURSELF. I slowed down, thoughtless, but it was the same. IN MANY METHODS RELATED TO MEDITATION THEY TEACH TO EMPTY THE MIND... BUT IN REALITY, IT IS JUST ONE STEP... BECAUSE ONE DAY WE FULFILL THE MIND WITH POSITIVITY BY CONTINUOUSLY NOURISH OUR QUALITIES AND BY UNDERSTANDING THE NEGATIVE MEMORIES AND TO WORK ON IT... THAT IS WHY THE MANTRA IS SO POWERFUL... BECAUSE WE CAN FOCUS ON PROFOUND QUALITIES IN US WHILE WE ARE PROGRESSIVELY TRANSFORMING OUR HUMAN DISTORTIONS... AS YOU CONTINUE DOING THE MANTRA, GRADUALLY THE POSITIVE THOUGHTS WILL BECOME A MENTAL HABIT, AND THE POSITIVE THOUGHTS WILL INCARNATE MORE AND MORE IN YOUR EMOTIONS, IN YOUR EMOTIONS, IN YOUR BEHAVIORS SINCE WE BECOME WHAT WE REPEAT... THAT BEING SAID, IF YOU SEE THAT IN THE CONCRETE IT REALLY CREATE CONSEQUENCES, MORE DIFFICULTIES, YOU SHOULD SEE A DOCTOR TO CHECK IF EVERYTHING IS OK WITH YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH TO REALLY MARRY SPIRIT AND MATTER... SO AS TO UNDERSTAND THE METAPHYSICAL CAUSE BUT ALSO THE MATTER... What should I do with these problems? I INVITE YOU TO SEE MY COMMENTS ABOVE ANGELIC MEDITATION FOR THE ACTIVATION OF INNER WARMTH AND CALMNESS WITH HAZIEL AND HAHAIAH ÂN

title_pdf: 07 Dream - experimental zoo. last case id: C0181. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 16 April 2021 Angel: 31 Lecabel Dream mood: Interesting, Fun, Exciting, Satisfied, Relax Dream and Analysis: ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU, I chant Angel Lecabel with a question: what is my motivation? I can't remember all the dream, just a few scenes. IT'S A GOOD ATTITUDE TO SEEK GUIDANCE FROM THE UP ABOVE I went to an experimental zoo, IN THE DREAM YOU ARE VISITING YOUR INNER ZOO TO LEARN, OBSERVE, AND TO BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR INNER ANIMAL WORLD BY STUDYING THE BEHAVIOR OF THE ANIMALS THERE I invited some friends to accompany me, including Nghia, a few men, and women, small family (adults, children). HERE YOU CAN OBSERVE THE BEHAVIOR OF ALL THE PARTS OF YOU WHICH WILL HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND CERTAIN INSTINCTUAL NEEDS, AND BEHAVIORS. SINCE YOU SEE MEN, WOMEN, AND FAMILY, SO THE DREAM IS REVEALING AN ASPECT OF YOUR MASCULINE POLARITY, FEMININE POLARITY, AND ALSO HOW YOU MAY SOMETIMES BEHAVE BECAUSE OF THE INFLUENCE OF INSTINCTS, IN YOUR INTIMACY WITH YOUR FAMILY. AND THE NOTION OF "EXPERIMENTAL" ZOO MEANS THAT YOU ARE DISCOVERING NEW AND UNCONSCIOUS AREAS OF YOUR UNCONSCIOUS... THE ANIMALS ARE ALSO LINKED WITH YOUR ENERGY OF MANIFESTATION, YOUR VITAL ENERGY, BUT ALSO YOUR INSTINCTUAL NEEDS... Nghia is a colleague of mine. [+ Quiet personality, a personality I like in a man, attentive, listening, careful, framework, polite, have a good will, endeavor, honesty, sincerity, faithfulness. ] [- Stubborn, difficult to accept new things, following atheism, not believing in spirituality, talking about personal stories with many people (not discreet), patriarchs. ] This zoo has dense forests , caves, and diverse terrain. AND WITH THE QUESTION YOU ASKED, YOU ARE VISITING INSTINCTUAL NEEDS AND FEELINGS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOURSELF (DENSE FORESTS)... AND THE CAVE IS A NOTION THAT YOU ARE ENTERING IN YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MORE AND MORE, YOU ARE DISCOVERING CERTAIN ORIGINS OF CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES RELATED TO MOTIVATION... Zoo showed that I was going slightly deep on instinctual needs. [+ revealing, diverse inner world, conscious and uncóncious, observation, learning, YES... YOU UNDERSTOOD IT WELL ] People walk in tunnels (caves type) with some orange furry monkeys , reddish-brown skinned on the walls, creepers . In this zoo, there is nothing between humans and animals, I find them very free, comfortable, close to them. They are very gentle and friendly, they are eating plants normally. Some children are scared, some are happy, I see them happy. HERE I INVITE YOU TO ANALYZE THE KEY SYMBOLS, DEAR NHU... FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN ANALYZE THE SYMBOL OF ORANGE FURRY MONKEY WITH THE APPROPRIATE STYLE... YOU CAN WATCH AGAIN THE TUTORIAL :-)... THE MONKEY IS A PART OF YOUR VITAL ENERGY, YOUR ENERGY OF MANIFESTATION THAT CAN BE TOO FOCUS ON PLEASURES (ORANGE) AND LACK DYNAMISM (ORANGE)... AND IN ITS PARTICULARITY, MONKEY IS KNOWN TO IMITATE OTHERS, SO UNCONSCIOUSLY (TUNNEL CAVES TYPE) YOU CAN EVENTUALLY REPEAT CERTAIN PATTERNS BECAUSE OF A LACK OF DISCERNMENT... AND YOU CAN LET YOUR INSTINCTUAL NEEDS TAKE TOO MUCH PLACE IN YOUR CONSCIENCE AT TIMES... BUT WHAT IS GOOD, IS THAT ALL THE ANIMALS ARE GENTLE BUT AT THE SAME TIME ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN WITH ANIMALS IF THEY FEEL ANY THREAT OR IF THEY ARE NOT HAPPY, OR IF THEY ARE HUNGRY...AND SOMETIMES, YOU CAN BE AFRAID ABOUT YOUR OWN UNCONSCIOUS NEEDS... -> Monkeys in zoo: I am not making a clear line between instinctive needs and spiritual, social needs, I am setting them free. I have it all in my mind and I think I'm doing my best by harmonizing them. I let everything grow naturally. IF THE ANIMALS ARE FREE IN THE ZOO, STILL THEY CAN HARM SOMEONE, OR EVEN IF THEY DO NOT HARM, THE CHILDREN CAN BE SCARED OF THEM AS IT IS HAPPENING IN YOUR DREAM. The child reflects for me, sometimes I feel satisfied, sometimes not. YES, VERY WELL ANALYZED. YOU ARE GRADUALLY ABLE TO DECODE THE SYMBOLS AND DREAM WELL :-) Everyone goes a little further, to a place must cross a small lake. Someone passes, some didn't. I was going through.SO IT MEANS THAT SOMETIMES YOU DO NOT QUESTION YOUR ACTIONS AS YOU WISH TO BE A PART OF A GROUP/TEAM, SOMETIMES YOU ARE ABLE TO OVERCOME YOUR EMOTIONS BUT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO PASS THROUGH THE DIFFICULT EMOTIONS. BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO PASS THROUGH THE LAKE ARE ALSO "YOU" IN THE DREAM. IT MEANS ALSO THAT YOU CAN HAVE DUALITIES IN YOU... AND THESE DUALITIES CAN EVENTUALLY DIMINISH YOUR MOTIVATION, SOMETIMES YOU CAN LIVE UPS AND DOWN... OF BEING HAPPY, BEING AFRAID (CHILDREN)... WANTING TO OVERCOME CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES RELATED TO YOUR EMOTIONS BUT HAVING DIFFICULTIES AT THE SAME TIME... -> I am going through my emotions, feelings (good and bad), I receive it all, understand, and pass it one by one. Initially, this outing group consisted of a group of members have family, then they invited me to go, and then I invited a few more friends to go with us. This experience was quite fun. At the end of the session, everyone gathered to tell fun stories. AND IN THIS SCENE, YOU ARE SHOWN THE DEEP MOTIVATION IN YOU... YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE IN HARMONY WITH YOURSELF, WITH YOUR INNER ANIMALS, YOUR ENERGIES OF MANIFESTATION... YOU WOULD LIKE TO SUCCEED TO GO THROUGH CERTAIN EMOTIONAL DIFFICULTIES... SO AS TO HAVE JOY IN YOUR HEART... BUT YOUR DRIVING FORCE TO MOVE FORWARD, TO OVERCOME DIFFICULTIES IS SOMETIMES BASED ON WHAT YOU PERCEIVE AS THE RIGHT BEHAVIOR AND RIGHT MANIFESTATION ACCORDING TO THE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE (MONKEY)... IN OTHER WORDS, YOU CAN SOMETIMES IMITATE OTHERS THINKING THAT IS THE RIGHT THINGS TO DO... . AND WHEN YOU ACHIEVE SOMETHING, WHICH OTHER PEOPLE ALSO APPRECIATE, YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF AND YOUR LIFE. THIS IS WHAT MOTIVATES YOU TO MANIFEST WITH THE SAME INSTINCTUAL NEEDS AND PATTERNS. BUT WHILE DOING ALL THIS, THERE ARE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF YOU, WHICH DO NOT FEEL GOOD AND ARE AFRAID OF YOUR OWN INSTINCTUAL NEEDS... From this dream, I like being in harmony with nature, with society, wanting to harmonize with everything. When I was in the social class, I encountered many difficulties, problems at work, life, friends, colleagues, relatives, but I gradually realized the core of this is accepting and overcome together. Each other overcomes with their own abilities, we do not need to force ourselves too much, we do not let ourselves be too lax, but we need to follow our own rhythm. YES WITH TIME, AS YOU EMBRACE THE SPIRITUAL VALUES AND MANIFEST WITH THE GUIDANCE FROM THE UP ABOVE, YOU MAY GRADUALLY START TO FOLLOW THE DIVINE RHYTHM In the end, I will be happy and satisfied with the results, everyone will be happy with their own journey. YES... YOU HAVE WELL UNDERSTOOD THE POTENTIAL IN YOU, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, HERE IT SHOWS ALSO HOW THE INSTINCTUAL AND UNCONSCIOUS NEEDS AND FEELINGS CAN INFLUENCE YOU BUT THAT YOU CAN PROGRESSIVELY TRANSFORM BY UNDERSTANDING THOSE MEMORIES... I want to ask more about my manifestations. After finishing a meal, I often get very headaches and sleepy, I can't stand it without rest after a meal. I kept yawning. I find out that when eating, it is necessary to increase blood flow to the brain to digest food, so it is normal to feel sleepy after eating. ON THE SYMBOLIC AND METAPHYSICAL LEVEL, IT SHOWS CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES TO DIGEST THE EXPERIENCES OF LIFE, CERTAIN EMOTIONS, CERTAIN THOUGHTS, BECAUSE OF HAVING DIFFICULTIES TO UNDERSTAND THEM FROM A SPIRITUAL POINT OF VIEW AND WHAT IS PROFOUND IT IS ALSO RELATED TO THE ORANGE FURRY MONKEY... BECAUSE THE ORANGE IN THE SYMBOLIC LANGUAGE IS RELATED TO PURITY, TO DYNAMISM, TO PLEASURE... SO YOU ARE SHOWN THAT SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE DEEPLY MOTIVATED TO DO EFFORTS IN YOUR LIFE BUT BEHIND IT IS BECAUSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO NOURISH CERTAIN NEEDS (ANIMALS), TO BE RECOGNIZED AND APPRECIATED BY OTHERS... AND THIS MOTIVATION CREATE A DISBALANCE IN LIFE, WHERE YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THE OTHER EXTREME SUCH AS LAZINESS, LACK OF DYNAMISM (ORANGE, YAWNING, FEEL SLEEPY).... SO IF YOU WISH, YOU CAN WRITE DOWN FOR YOURSELF WHAT HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR YOU, AND THEN GRADUALLY YOU CAN TRY TO DECODE THEM SYMBOLICALLY WITH THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF RESONANCE. THIS PROCESS WILL GRADUALLY HELP YOU TO DIGEST THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE. However, for me, I find myself more sleepy than everyone else, whether I eat a little or eat a lot, or I'm not full. I just need to eat a little cake, drink sugary drinks or light fruit juice, I feel sleepy. AND WHAT YOU MENTIONED IS ALSO ABOUT SWEETNESS, TENDERNESS THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR... SUCH AS CAKE, SUGARY DRINK, JUICE FRUIT... SO EVENTUALLY, YOU CAN HAVE DIFFICULTIES TO RECEIVE LOVE BECAUSE LOVE CAN CREATE LAZINESS AND A DIFFICULTY TO MAKE EFFORTS IN LIFE... THAT IS WHY SOMETIMES, WHEN YOU ADVANCE IN LIFE, YOU CAN BE TOO HARSH WITH YOURSELF TO MAKE SURE TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE BECAUSE REMAINING GENTLE AND DEVELOP DISCIPLINE AT THE SAME TIME REQUIRE A LOT OF PRACTICE UNTIL WE CAN FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE... WOW... IT IS SO PROFOUND TO UNDERSTAND THAT... AND REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE ALSO MANY QUALITIES IN YOU... AND THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO TRANSFORM ANY NEGATIVITY BY UNDERSTANDING THOSE PATTERNS WITH SELF- COMPASSION... THAT BEING SAID, IF THESE SYMPTOMS REMAIN AND CREATE PROBLEM IN YOUR LIFE, YOU CAN VISIT A DOCTOR TO SEE WHAT IS 23/07/2025, 11:07 experimental zoo | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/80992 2/3 HAPPENING IN THE PHYSICAL LEVEL... I understand according to the symbolic language, it can be understood that food is a form of absorbing energy, when it receives too much energy that the body cannot bear, it will be swollen, creating an unpleasant feeling. But I ate less, ate just enough, even not, but still could not erase the feeling of sleep, many times I wanted to fall down but when I lay on the bed I could not sleep. IT IS BECAUSE YOUR INNER ANIMALS ARE TEMPORARILY FED AND FULL, SO IT CREATE LAZINESS, AND A DIFFICULTY TO MANIFEST... BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU CAN FORCE TOO MUCH... AND YOU COULD NOT SLEEP BECAUSE OF CERTAIN DUALITIES, IT IS LIKE A PART OF YOU WANT TO MANIFEST STRONGLY BUT ANOTHER WANT TO SLEEP AND IT CREATES A DISCREPANCY WHERE YOU WOULD LIKE TO SLEEP BUT CANNOT... SO AT THAT MOMENT, YOU CAN TALK TO YOURSELF AND REPLACE YOUR INTENTION OF REST, AND RELAX THE RIGHT WAY... RELAXING NOT OUT OF LAZINESS, BUT RELAXING OUT OF WANTING TO RENEW YOUR ENERGY OF MANIFESTATION, TO INTERIORIZE, TO MEDITATE AND TO CONTINUE TO DO YOUR BEST AFTER... YOU CAN EVEN TAKE A MOMENT TO BREATHE, TO CHANT THE MANTRA IN ORDER TO HAVE A GOOD INTENTION WHILE YOU ARE WORKING OR WHILE YOU ARE RESTING... DEAR NHU, PLEASE YOU CAN WATCH THE TUTORIAL AGAIN SO AS TO USE THE APPROPRIATE STYLE TO WRITE YOUR DREAMS... YOU WILL SEE THAT IT WILL HELP YOU TO GO MORE IN-DEPTH IN THE ANALYSIS OF YOUR DREAM :-) ANGELIC CONTINUITY ON THE PATH OF DIVINE MATERIALIZATION AND BALANCE IN LIFE BY UNDERSTANDING YOUR POTENTIAL THAT DWELLS IN YOUR INNER ANIMALS, IN YOUR FORCE OF MANIFESTATION... WITH OMAEL AND MENADEL ÂN

title_pdf: 08 Life - Money and talk. last case id: C0182. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 23 April 2021 Angel: 32 Vasariah Dream mood: Conflict, Worry, doubt Dream and Analysis: ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU, This week I still don't remember dreams, just 1 image and I do not really remember it. So I just tell you my week, somethings happen. YES, YOU CAN ANALYZE YOUR DAY-TO-DAY LIFE LIKE A DREAM AND CAN GET A PROFOUND UNDERSTANDING. At the beginning of the week, I withdraw a sizable amount of cash from the bank to deposit it into another of my accounts. But when I loaded in with an ATM, I put the full amount in, I was a bit in a hurry to do this, so all my cash was stuck in the ATM and in my account also no extra enter money. I am quite worried that I will lose all of this money or not. I contacted a bank officer to talk about this emergency. I worry that when I go away the machine might open and someone will take all my money. Meanwhile, the Bank staff did not say clearly about my money being lost or not, they only recognized and responded that it would be processed. AND IF YOU SEE THAT AS A DREAM, THIS INCIDENT IS SHOWING CERTAIN INSECURITIES REGARDING MONEY, RESOURCES, AND THE FEAR OF LOSING ENERGY/WILLPOWER TO MATERIALIZE. SO WHEN YOU PLAN TO INVEST YOUR RESOURCES, TIME, AND WILLPOWER IN ANOTHER PROJECT YOUR INSECURITIES MAKE YOU IMPATIENT AND RESTLESS. BUT, SINCE THE PEOPLE AT THE BANK WERE NOT WORRIED AND THEY ASSURED YOU THAT THE AMOUNT WILL BE PROCESSED, IT SHOWS YOUR ABILITY TO MANAGE RESOURCES WELL WITH PATIENCE AND BY FOLLOWING THE RIGHT PROCESS. Money: energy. This shows that I have lost my energy in social life, in work. I worry too much about this lack of energy, while society feels it very normal. I have the ability to sometimes take the problem seriously, small issues also to be very serious.YES AND IT HAPPENS BECAUSE OF THE MEMORIES OF INSECURITIES COMING FROM PAST LIVES. AND YOU CAN EVEN MAKE A LINK WITH DREAMS THAT YOU HAD, ABOUT BEING TOO FOCUS ON MATTER, BEING TOO DOWN-TO-EARTH, FOCUS ON RESULTS... THOSE MEMORIES CAN BE MIXED WITH INSECURITIES, THE FEAR OF LOSING THAT CAN EMERGE... THIS SCENE WAS SYNCHRONIZED BY THE UNIVERSE SO YOU CAN WORK ON CERTAIN MEMORIES :-) BECAUSE ONE DAY, WE ACCEPT THE NATURAL FLOW OF THINGS WITHOUT BEING WORRIED... OF COURSE, WE DO THINGS IN MATTER TO SOLVE PROBLEMS BUT WITH A PEACEFUL AND CALM ENERGY... The next day, I had a talk with one of my colleagues, who is also my boss (non-direct boss), who also appeared in the dream "Eating fast food together" - Han. I plan to confide during the past 1 year working at the company, seem to understand each other better and understand the upcoming path. YOU WISH TO CREATE INNER SUPPORT SO THAT YOU CAN CREATE A BETTER FUTURE FOR YOURSELF AND YOU ARE SHOWN HOW BY WORKING ON YOURSELF, YOU CAN CREATE BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE... At first, we went to the cafe, but there was one more colleague who was also my boss by rank. For me, I see he is a normal colleague. This is a man with a gentle personality, listening, careful but at the same time very difficult, not good at leadership. In the cafe, we just talked simply. Han talked about numerology, I also shared about the DSSI course, I feel the similarities between these two. After that, I intend to talk privately with Han in the meal after that, we go vegetarian, recently Han has switched to a vegetarian diet and she is a Buddhist. She is very deep and delicate. However, the male colleague also came along because his appointment was canceled. This shows that Han and I have a spiritual connection, spirit level. However, between us, there are barriers in terms of the act, expression (the man). HERE IT IS MORE THE NOTION THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO FOLLOW THE NATURAL FLOW AS WITH THE PROBLEM WITH THE ATM... IF THE MALE COLLEAGUE, MALE BOSS, WAS THERE, IT WAS ALSO FOR A REASON... ORGANIZED BY THE UNIVERSE... BECAUSE ONE DAY, WE DON'T CONSIDER OTHER LIKE BARRIER, WE ALWAYS CONSIDER OTHER AS PARTS OF YOU, PARTS OF THE UNIVERSE WHO WILL HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND YOURSELF MORE AND MORE :-)... SOMETIMES YOU CAN ADMIRE A LITTLE TOO MUCH YOUR INNER HAN THAT IS WHY YOU HAD THIS FEELING OF HAVING BARRIERS IN YOUR COMMUNICATION WITH THE OTHER PART OF YOU At the end of the meal, I had the opportunity to talk about work with Han. But when it comes out, it is not really light and meaningful. I really don't want that. It happened in the form of question and answer, query. I feel that Han is uncomfortable talking about this too. After that session, I thought a lot about whether I was behaving incorrectly, over-leveling, or asking too much. Or Han just answered what I wanted to hear, and the real story behind her could not be shared. AND THIS HAPPEN BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO SHARE TOO MUCH, WANTING TO CREATE AFFINITIES BUT WITH AN ENERGY OF REJECTION AT THE SAME TIME... AND IF YOU FEEL THAT SOMEONE IS UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN TALKING, IT IS ALSO A SIGN TO BECOME MORE RECEPTIVE... SO YOU SEE THAT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT, AT TIMES, TO FOLLOW THE NATURAL FLOW, THE SYNCHRONICITY, BECAUSE OF A LACK OF RECEPTIVITY... BUT OF COURSE, THE MORE YOU WILL CLEANSE YOUR MEMORIES OF WANTING TO PLEASE OTHERS, TO BE LOVED BY PEOPLE YOU VALUE AND ADMIRE, THE MEMORIES OF INSECURITIES, THE MORE YOU WILL BE RECEPTIVE TO THE UNIVERSE SO AS TO FOLLOW SYNCHRONICITIES AND THE NATURAL MOVEMENT... When we haven't already connected and understood each other energetically, Han and I displayed the wrong energy when communicating with each other, making the story complicated and difficult. IT IS ALSO BECAUSE OF CERTAIN RESONANCES THAT YOU SHARE WITH HER AND I INVITE YOU TO REFLECT ON CERTAIN RESONANCES THAT TRIGGERS HER TO ACT THIS WAY. YOU CAN ALSO MEDITATE AND CHECK WITH YOURSELF, WHAT KIND OF INTENTIONS AND ENERGY YOU HAD DURING THE CONVERSATION. MORE THAN OUR WORDS THE ENERGY SPEAKS AND GIVES THE MESSAGES. 2 days later, the work problems between me and her were somehow resolved (probably solved by my direct boss), and at the same time, I received the correct amount that I deposit into my account. I felt relieved and better. A BEAUTIFUL SIGN BY THE UNIVERSE THAT THINGS ARE RESOLVED WITH TIME AT THEIR OWN PACE. AND ALSO IT SHOWS AN ABILITY IN YOU TO RESOLVE THE INNER CONFLICTS AND CONTINUE IN THE PATH OF THE RIGHT MATERIALIZATION On the contrary, thanks to barriers about acting and expression, and people at the social level, I replenished my energy, circulated energy, and continued on my way to work. BUT HERE THE BARRIER WAS MORE BECAUSE OF CERTAIN MEMORIES OF REJECTION IN YOU, SO YOU SEE THAT SOMETIMES YOU CAN CREATE REJECTION AND ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU WANT TOO MUCH TO CREATE CONNECTION WHEN YOU FEEL ADMIRATION, PROFOUND AND DEEP QUALITIES IN A PERSON... SINCE YOU WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP THOSE QUALITIES IN YOU... BUT YOU SEE THAT WHEN YOU WOULD LIKE TOO MUCH TO CREATE CONNECTION, IT WILL CREATE A DIFFICULTY FOR YOU TO COMMUNICATE THE RIGHT WAY...IT IS VERY PROFOUND VERY TO UNDERSTAND THAT.... AND WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE, YOU ARE ABLE TO ENTER IN THE DEEP ROOT OF CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES SO AS TO CREATE BEAUTIFUL AND PROFOUND RELATIONSHIP WITH COLLEAGUES, FRIENDS, EMPLOYER, ETC. ANGELIC DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR RECEPTIVITY SO AS TO FOLLOW THE MOVEMENT OF THE UNIVERSE FREE OF INSECURITIES AND NEED TO BE APPRECIATED BUT WITH WISDOM AND COMPASSION WITH MENADEL & VEULIAH ÂN

But when I loaded in with an ATM, I put the full amount in, I was a bit in a hurry to do this, so all my cash was stuck in the ATM and in my account also no extra enter money. I am quite worried that I will lose all of this money or not. I contacted a bank officer to talk about this emergency. I worry that when I go away the machine might open and someone will take all my money. Meanwhile, the Bank staff did not say clearly about my money being lost or not, they only recognized and responded that it would be processed. Money: energy. This shows that I have lost my energy in social life, in work. I worry too much about this lack of energy, while society feels it very normal. I have the ability to sometimes take the problem seriously, small issues also to be very serious.",

At first, we went to the cafe, but there was one more colleague who was also my boss by rank. For me, I see he is a normal colleague. This is a man with a gentle personality, listening, careful but at the same time very difficult, not good at leadership. In the cafe, we just talked simply. Han talked about numerology, I also shared about the DSSI course, I feel the similarities between these two. After that, I intend to talk privately with Han in the meal after that, we go vegetarian, recently Han has switched to a vegetarian diet and she is a Buddhist. She is very deep and delicate. However, the male colleague also came along because his appointment was canceled. At the end of the meal, I had the opportunity to talk about work with Han. But when it comes out, it is not really light and meaningful. I really don't want that. It happened in the form of question and answer, query. I feel that Han is uncomfortable talking about this too.",

title_pdf: 09 Dream - Days Off. last case id: C0183. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 30 April 2021 Angel: 31 Lecabel Dream mood: Fun, Surprise, Humor, Worry, Feeling good Dream and Analysis: ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU In my company, I take a day off from work. Later that day, Nob recorded the team's progress for me that day, in a notebook. Nob is my colleague. Nob is a Transguy (outside is a girl, but inside is a boy) HERE NOB IS SHOWING THE MEMORIES WHERE THE EXPRESSION OF THE POLARITIES IS NOT BALANCED FOR E.G SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE MORE EMISSIVE AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACT WITH RECEPTIVITY, UNDERSTANDING, AND LOVE. THE EMOTIONS WITHIN CAN BEDIFFERENT THAN HOW YOU ACT OUT [+ kind, humorous, generous, loyal person. ] [- hatred, aggression ] Nob let me see what the team did that day, how happy it was. Especially at the end of the hour, everyone left. Nhu was going downstairs in a special way. Nhu is my staff, she appeared in my some other dreams. [+ smart, sociable, hard-working, cheerful, have goodwill, and leadership skill ] [- innocent, somewhat emotional, or argumentative ] And Tam brought water pipes to repair A NEED TO RENEW THE RIGHT FLOW OF EMOTIONS, A NEED TO RECYCLE AND REJUVENATE THE EMOTIONS. Tam is my new colleague [+ cute, kind, generous girl ] [- doesn't really work hard and focus on her work THIS SHOWS THE DUALITIES WITHIN, NOT ABLE TO WORK WITH THE INTENTION TO DEVELOP QUALITIES IN WHATEVER WE DO, LACK OF DIRECTION ] When I read it, I was very happy and humorous, partly due to the way Nob's storytelling. I think about memorizing past times and events, events where I might not be there, I want to know all of these. SO HERE YOU CAN ANALYZE THE NOTION OF THE DAY OFF, YOU ARE SHOWN WHAT IS HAPPENING IN YOU SINCE YOU ARE STILL CONTINUING CONNECTING WITH YOUR WORK EVEN IN DAY OFF... IT CAN SHOW A PROFOUND LEVEL OF DEVOTION BUT HERE IT IS MORE THE NEGATIVE ASPECT WHERE YOU CAN HAVE DIFFICULTIES TO INTERIORIZE, TO TAKE TIME FOR MEDITATE... IT IS LIKE EVEN DURING YOUR "DAY OFF" YOU CAN STILL CONTINUE TO WORK AND IT LEAD YOU TO HAVE DIFFICULTIES IN THE EMOTIONAL LEVEL, TO MANAGE THE DIRECTION OF YOUR EMOTIONS... (WATER PIPE) SINCE YOU CAN BE OVER-EMISSIVE AT TIMES... YOU CAN EVEN ANALYZE YOUR INNER NHU WHO WAS GOING DOWNSTAIRS IN A SPECIAL WAY... IT MEANS THAT WHEN YOU INCARNATE IN MATTER (DOWNSTAIRS), YOU CAN HAVE DUALITIES OF HARD WORKING AND NOT SUFFICIENTLY DILIGENT... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... The next day I go to work. I am amazed that it was exactly the same day as yesterday, as Nob told me. I was really surprised. At the end of the day, Nhu goes downstairs in a funny way. It's crazy, a bit of walking, laughing, and jumping down each step, just like Nob had said yesterday. Even though I know it, I still found it very funny. HERE IT SHOWS THAT WHEN YOU TRY TO INCARNATE I.E DO THE ACTION WITH THE ENERGY AS REPRESENTED BY NHU (IN MINUS), YOU MAY NOT BE CONCENTRATED AND FOCUSSED MUCH ON THE WORK AND MAY SEEK FUN WHILE YOU ARE AT WORK. IT SHOWS CERTAIN OF LAXITY AT THE WORKPLACE I was wondering about the coincidence but also enjoying the events of that day. Nhu represents the way I receive and work in the company, the way I think about being interesting, funny and also very messy. The overlap between the two dates represents the overlap between present and past times. The way I think, work, and show is the same. AND THE NOTION OF REPETITION MEANS THAT YOU CAN REPEAT CERTAIN PATTERNS SINCE YOU HAVE DIFFICULTIES UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU CAN HAVE PROBLEMS RELATED TO BEING RECEPTIVE AND EMISSIVE, DIFFICULTIES TO DEVELOP JOY AND FUN IN THE WAY YOUR WORK ON YOURSELF BUT ALSO DO THE OUTER WORK... YOU ARE SHOWN CERTAIN DUALITIES BETWEEN HARDWORKING (AND LOSING THE JOY) OR HAVING FUN (BUT LOSING THE WILLPOWER OF DOING EFFORTS) Tam bring the plumbing [- transmitting, expressing, receiving emotions that was damaged, having problems ] to repair, I suggest helping her. The room where Tam brought a plumbing fixture to repair, accidentally was at the foot of the stairs where Nhu go down (this is not my company). The living room including a shower [+ cleanse YES BUT AS THE DREAM IS MORE NEGATIVE IT IS MORE THE NEGATIVE ASPECT... IT IS NOT VERY LOGICAL TO HAVE A SHOWER IN THE LIVING ROOM... IT MEANS THAT YOU SOMETIMES NEED THE SOCIAL LEVEL TO PURIFY CERTAIN NEGATIVE EMOTIONS... ] . THE LIVING ROOM HERE SHOWS YOUR SOCIAL INTIMACY , I,E HOW YOU FEEL, THINK INSIDE WHEN YOU ARE AT THE WORKPLACE. THE REPAIR WORK AND THE PLUMBING HERE SYMBOLIZE THE NEED TO CLEANSE YOUR EMOTIONAL I don't know why Tam took the plumbing pipe for repair, but Tam put the plumbing (a thick, dark rubber tube) in a bag, outside the room. I left my problems of emotions outside, I don't care if it matters but continue. Now it is broken. YES, WELL UNDERSTOOD... AND WHEN SOMETHING FALLS DOWN, IT SHOWS A DYNAMIC OF BEING TOO DOWN-TO-EARTH IN YOUR REPARATION PROCESS... YOU CAN BE TOO FOCUSED ON RESULT INSTEAD OF ENJOYING THE JOURNEY OF SELF-DISCOVERING... AND YOU HAVE DIFFICULTIES TO BE AWARE OF THAT (I DON'T KNOW WHY TAM TOOK THE PLUMBING PIPE FOR REPAIR) Tam took a bath before me. After taking a bath, Tam didn't have any clothes [- too focus on matters DIFFICULTY TO WELL ORGANIZED THE CLEANSING PROCESS... IT IS THE NOTION OF NEGLECTING THE SOCIAL LEVEL, THE AURA YOU CAN EMANATE... ] so Tam wrapped 2 towels [+ cleaning AND HERE IT IS THE NEGATIVE ASPECT WHERE YOU CAN HAVE DIFFICULTIES TO DEVELOP INTIMACY... IN THE RELATIONAL LEVEL... (2) ] , one above and one below. At this time, I was taking a bath, then suddenly a few partners came, all the men (masculinity) So I have to get into a corner to avoid it. My femininity is being invaded by masculinity, the fact that I am overly exaggeratingly hard, too hard, without inner reception HERE IT SHOWS MORE A NOTION OF LOSING YOUR INTIMACY BECAUSE OF FUSING TOO MUCH WITH THE SOCIAL... SO YOU SEE, WHEN YOU HAVE DUALITIES IN YOUR INNER AND OUTER WORK, IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO PURIFY CERTAIN NEGATIVE MEMORIES... YOU CAN HAVE DIFFICULTIES TO REST AND TAKE TIME FOR YOURSELF, FOR RENEWING YOUR ENERGY... (DAY OFF) Fortunately, I just rinsed my wet body, not in time to put soap on me. I got a shirt right there, but I was short of pants. My pant was in a plumbing bag outside the door so I asked Tam to take it for me. Then Tam talked with the visitors a few sentences and asked permission to go out. She went to get me pants. From this dream, I am too focused on showing from the outside (having a lot of manliness), although I work flexibly, not rigid, cheerful, my expression is quite rigid. I do not care about inner reception, not attentive to emotions within me. YES, THE NOTION OF HAVING MEN THAT ARRIVES SHOWS A LACK OF INTIMACY SINCE YOU CAN CONNECT TOO MUCH YOUR INTIMACY WITH THE SOCIAL LEVEL... AND YOU CAN BE OVER- EMISSIVE AT TIMES, OR NOT ENOUGH EMISSIVE (TOO MUCH IN A "HARDWORK" MODE VERSUS LAZINESS (INNER TAM)).... I think this dream is also related to the way I express and talk to the outside. I find myself not communicating well. Sometimes I have one way in mind, but speak out in another one. Or there are times when I say it but I'm not sure if that's what I think or not. I often say things that displease others that are not my intention either. AND THIS IS HAPPENING BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU CAN ENTER INTO THE INTIMACY OF OTHERS WITHOUT NOTICING... (MEN THAT ENTER IN THE LIVING ROOM WITH THE SHOWER)... I felt that my ability to connect with my thoughts, my inner voice to show the outside, was greatly deflected. Sometimes I say ideas that are contradictory, heterogeneous and they compete with each other. In my mind, there are many contradictory thoughts that I do not know what is what I want, what is right, what is wrong. AND THROUGH TIME, EFFORTS, AND BY UNDERSTANDING YOUR UNCONSCIOUS, YOU WILL HARMONIZE THOSE THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS SINCE YOU ARE ANALYZING THE ROOT CAUSES OF CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES... AND THE LIFE THAT YOU CAN CREATE, BY KNOWING AND TRANSFORMING NEGATIVE MEMORIES, IS REALLY AMAZING... YOU MAY SOMETIMES FEEL BORED OR FEEL A LACK OF FOCUS AT THE WORKPLACE OR BEING TOO INTENSE AT WORK BUT WHEN WE START TO DO EACH ACTION AND WORK WITH THE INTENTION TO DEVELOP QUALITIES AND UNDERSTANDING THE DEEP MEANING OF WHAT WE ARE DOING, EACH TASK BECOMES INTERESTING. IT IS A PROFOUND DREAM THAT YOU HAD, DEAR NHU, IT SHOWS THE DUALITIES YOU CAN HAVE SOMETIMES... ONE DAY IT IS POSSIBLE TO ALWAYS ENJOY OUR WORK, TO HAVE ALWAYS LOVE INSIDE AND BUILD A STRONG MOTIVATION THAT WILL NOT CREATE LAZINESS OR TIREDNESS BECAUSE THE MOTIVATION WILL BE OUT OF LOVE... OUT OF LOVING DEVELOPING OURSELF AND HELPING OTHERS... 23/07/2025, 11:09 Days Off | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/81828 2/3 ANGELIC BALANCE BETWEEN YOUR MASCULINE AND FEMININE, BETWEEN YOUR INTIMACY AND SOCIAL LEVEL SO AS TO CREATE GREAT RELATIONSHIP IN EVERY FIELD OF YOUR LIFE WITH YERATHEL & HAAIAH ÂN

title_pdf: 10 Dream - Doors in classroom. last case id: C0184. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 7 May 2021 Angel: 31 Lecabel Dream mood: Shy, Afraid, awkwardness, Observing, Emotional, Self confident Dream and Analysis: ANGELIC HELLO NHU, I chant Angel Lecabel with the question: what lessons do I need to learn with finance, money symbol? LET'S SEE WHAT UP ABOVE ANSWER TO YOU :-) Dream 1: This place looks like a classroom. There are 2 doors [+ receptivity, airy, thinking, relationship, protection ] [- too airy, over- thinking, too open HERE IT SHOWS MORE THE NOTION OF APPRENTICESHIP AND A DIFFICULTY TO OPEN CERTAIN DOOR, CERTAIN AREAS OF YOUR CONSCIENCE RELATED TO THE RELATIONAL LEVEL (2 DOORS) ] on the left and right. For me, the left door [- emotions, close the opening AND THE LEFT IS RELATED TO THE INNER WORLD, THE FEMININE POLARITY, YOUR RECEPTIVITY... AND THE FACT THAT THIS DOOR IS HIDDEN SHOWS THAT YOU CAN HIDE, FROM YOURSELF AND OTHERS, CERTAIN NEGATIVE MEMORIES SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING SCENE OF THE DREAM... ] is hidden. Initially, everyone went in and out with the left door. After a while, it was locked, unusable so everyone used the right door. This door has 2 classes: 1 class in the classroom, to a small space, then is another door. This door was in the middle of a wall as high as a gate fence for the classroom. AND HERE IS THE NOTION OF BEING TOO FOCUS ON MANIFESTATION (RIGHT DOOR) IN YOUR CONSCIENCE WHILE YOU CAN HIDE THE EMOTIONAL LEVEL, AND THE NOTION OF MANY DOOR + SMALL SPACE SHOWS ALSO SEPARATION AND AN INFERIORITY COMPLEX (SMALL SPACE) IN YOUR CONSCIENCE... BECAUSE WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND BOTH MASCULINE AND FEMININE POLARITY TO WELL UNDERSTOOD FINANCE AND MONEY... YOU CAN HAVE CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES TO UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONAL LEVEL AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND MONEY, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE RELATIONAL LEVEL WORK, THE EXCHANGE OF MONEY, THE EXCHANGE OF RESOURCES, BUT ALSO HOW THE EMOTIONAL LEVEL WORK WHEN WE THINK IN TERM OF FINANCE... THAT IS WHY PEOPLE WHO KNOW EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE OFTEN KNOW HOW TO INCREASE THE FINANCE BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT CAN ATTRACT PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW TO ACTIVATE CERTAIN EMOTIONS IN PEOPLE, OF COURSE, IT HAS TO BE DONE THE RIGHT WAY... OTHERWISE, IT WILL BE THE NEGATIVE KARMA THAT CAN INCREASE... INSTEAD OF POSITIVE FORCES, INSTEAD OF CREATING POSITIVE INSPIRATION... People go in and out, I just stood outside and watched. Mr. Soai [+ gentle, positive, hard work, ductility ] [- lack of leadership skill, ] stood on the podium. Here I think everyone is working but sitting posture like in a classroom. GOING IN AND OUT SHOWS THE DUALITIES WHEN YOU WOULD LIKE TO LEARN SOMETHING... SOMETIMES YOU WOULD LIKE TO LEARN STRONGLY (INNER SOAI), SOMETIMES YOU DON'T WANT... BECAUSE OF THE MEMORIES SHOWN ABOVE... YOU SEE ALSO THAT YOU CAN SOMETIMES HAVE A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN WORKING AND LEARNING... WITH THIS KIND OF DREAM YOU CAN SEE THAT CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE IN YOU, WHEN YOU ARE IN A WORKING PROCESS, CAN BE TOO THEORETICAL (NEGATIVE ASPECT OF CLASSROOM) I think sometimes I opened too much or close too much, I can't balance things on work and social life. I hide my emotions inside and open a little outside. However, I am open-minded with stubbornness (door in middle of wall). It's not right emission. I have lack of leadership skill so when I work, I still feel that I need to learn more and more (everyone works but sitting posture like in classroom) IT IS WELL CONNECTED WITH THE CONCRETE REALITY.... I lack of belief in myself. AND IT IS BECAUSE YOU CAN SOMETIMES CLOSE THE DOOR OF YOUR EMOTION (LEFT DOOR THAT IS CLOSED)... AND ONCE YOU ARE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND YOUR EMOTIONS, YOUR RESONANCES, IT CREATES EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE... IT CREATES MORE DISCERNMENT... MORE LEADERSHIP... There were a few people go in and out. I told a person at that time that the inside door should be opened, should not be closed as it is now, I don't know why. But I think since there are so many people going in and out, it would be a bit troublesome for the next person to open that door, so just close the outside door (middle of the wall). And everyone agrees. This dream shows I can't balance my emotions. THE FINAL SCENE SHOWS A DIFFICULTY TO OPEN THE DOOR OF APPRENTICESHIP BECAUSE OF ALL THE MEMORIES SHOWN ABOVE... BECAUSE OF A LACK OF RECEPTIVITY IN YOUR LEARNING PROCESS SINCE YOU CAN BE MORE FOCUSED ON MATTER, ON RESULT (LEFT DOOR CLOSED, RIGHT DOOR OPENED)... THIS DREAM SHOWS THE INTENTION BEHIND YOUR QUESTION, YOU WOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT FINANCE AND MONEY BUT YOU CAN HAVE CERTAIN LIMITATION TO LEARN BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF OPENNESS REGARDING THE EMOTIONAL LEVEL... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... YOU RECEIVE A PROFOUND ANSWER FROM THE UNIVERSE, NHU... IT IS A WONDERFUL INVITATION TO UNDERSTAND SOME HIDDEN INTENTIONS SO AS TO LEARN WITH A SENSE OF ALTRUISM AND NOT JUST FOR PERSONAL BENEFIT DEAR NHU, I INVITE YOU TO DETECT THE KEY SYMBOLS OF YOUR DREAM AS SHOWN IN THE TUTORIAL ... IT WILL HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND YOUR DREAM MORE IN-DEPTH... AND I ALSO INVITE YOU TO CREATE ANOTHER ENTRY IN YOUR DREAM JOURNAL WHEN YOU HAVE ANOTHER DREAM.... SO I WILL LET YOU ANALYZE YOUR DREAM FOR THE NEXT TIME THANK YOU FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING AND GREAT EFFORTS ANGELIC APPRENTICESHIP WITH RECEPTIVITY SO AS TO UNDERSTAND THE COLLECTIVE MOVEMENT BEHIND THE EXCHANGE OF RESOURCES , WITH VEULIAH & NELKHAEL, ÂN Dream 2: I drove across the road close to my ex's work. After that, I go to a house. This is a space below the stairs, quite tight. I am washing and repairing motorbikes, about 3 - 4. It looks quite tight and closes together (motorbikes) because of the small space, but it is arranged straight and neat. Exactly like reality in ex's shop. I have many sources to advance in life, in work (motorbikes). Because of many sources so I have difficulty (small space) advancing even everything straight and neat. While I am washing motorbike (renew the way to advance) I think: whether my ex-lover [+ gentle, listen, tenderness, loyal ] [- lie, unfaithful, not clear, not straightforward ] accidentally walks over here, accidentally sees me or not. Because it's very close to where that person is. I have a feeling that if the person accidentally saw me, I would be a little shy because I did not pass by intentionally, just unintentionally, then he would ask why I came here, make excuses to talk to me. I was able to wash my motorbike for a while when an employee in his shop accidentally passed me. He drank water, sat on the chair next to me to rest. Then I lower my head to avoid him so he does not recognize me. When I went back and forth to get things, I lowered my head. That person did not notice at first, but after seeing this, he feels strange. Then, he looked down at me. I and he look at each other. Then he smiled at me, a social smile, I smiled back at him. After that, I continue doing my job. I think this week too many things happened and I have got all things stuck. I can't think out to analysis.

title_pdf: 11 Dream - Assassinate. last case id: C0185. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 21 May 2021 Angel: 7 Achaiah Dream mood: Angry, Emotional, Observing, In doubt, Scare, Safe, Confused Dream and Analysis: ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU, This dream is like a film that includes many segments. I remember the last part. Before that, there was a picture when I was at work/studying. SO THE FIRST SCENE SHOWS YOUR INNER WORLD WHEN YOU ARE AT WORK OR IN A LEARNING PROCESS There was a white house with a beautiful lake in front of the house. THE LAKE SHOWS YOUR EMOTIONAL LEVEL... AND THE NOTION OF PICTURE SHOWS THAT YOU ARE STUDYING CERTAIN STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP IN YOU... SUCH AS A BEAUTIFUL INNER AND SPIRITUAL (WHITE) STRUCTURE WITH CALM EMOTIONS (LAKE)... The house is on the dirt road, like in the countryside, across the road is a field. The house is surrounded by white high walls. HERE IN THE PLUS THE WHITE HOUSE SHOWS THE SPIRITUAL VALUES, PEACE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP REGARDING YOUR INTIMACY BUT SINCE THEY ARE HIGH WALLS, IT'S LIKE MAKING A BOUNDARY AROUND YOURSELF SO AS NOT TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO ENTER INTO YOUR PERSONAL SPACE... YOU ARE SHOWN A NEED FOR OVER-PROTECTING YOUR INTIMACY... AND THE NOTION OF COUNTRYSIDE + DIRTY ROAD MEANS THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES THAT YOU CAN LIVE IN THE SOCIAL LEVEL, HAVING DIFFICULTIES TO RENEW CERTAIN CONCEPTS (COUNTRYSIDE), HAVING A DIFFICULTY TO TAKE CARE OF THE WAY YOU ADVANCE IN LIFE, ETC. The last segment is when I go home. This house is just a brick house, not whitewashed. SO HOME IS WHERE YOU COME BACK TO YOUR INNER SPACE. YOU ARE REACHING TO THE MEMORIES OF YOUR INTIMACY AND BY RETURNING HOME, YOU ARE RETURNING IN THE ROOT CAUSE OF CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES THAT YOU SAW IN THE FIRST SCENE... . The house has a corrugated iron roof, surrounded by corrugated iron. THE CORRUGATION HAPPENS BECAUSE OF THE CONTACT BETWEEN IRON AND OXYGEN, IT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE NEGLECTED ALSO YOUR INNER ROOF... AND THE ROOF IS RELATED TO YOUR THOUGHTS BUT ALSO THE PROTECTION... SO IT MEANS THAT CERTAIN NEGATIVE MEMORIES CAN ENTER IN YOUR THOUGHTS... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... . Around the house are trees, bushes and many tall trees like in the middle of a forest. SO YOU ALSO SEE AN ASPECT WHERE YOU CAN BE WITHDRAWN INTO YOURSELF, WHERE YOU SOMETIMES PREFER TO WITHDRAW YOURSELF FROM SOCIETY... BECAUSE OF YOUR SENSITIVITY AND THE FOREST ALSO SHOWS THE MEMORIES RELATED TO CERTAIN ASPECTS THAT ARE UNCONSCIOUS AND THAT TOUCHES YOUR INSTINCTUAL NEEDS AND EMOTIONAL NEEDS.... It shows my inner intimacy is too old, not cared for and perfected, neglected (image of the house has not been whitewashed). Compared to when I go to work/study, I show a beautiful, simple and luxurious, discreet (high-walled white house), showing how I ascend on the social level. YES VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD... YOU CAN SEE A CERTAIN DISCREPANCY BETWEEN WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP (PICTURE) AND WHAT KIND OF MEMORIES YOU STILL HAVE INSIDE... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... When I got home it was almost dark, SO YOU ARE REACHING TO THE UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES... IT SHOWS PATTERNS THAT YOU ARE NOT ALWAYS AWARE OF... I I saw on the porch with my ex-lover [+ gentle, obedient, simple, loyal ] [- unfaithful, unclear, complicated ] and a friend (a man I don't know) drinking. YOU ARE ALSO BEING SHOWN AN UNKNOWN ASPECT OF YOU WHERE YOU ARE NOURISHING EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES AND HERE YOU SEE ALSO THAT YOU HAVE MEMORIES RELATED TO YOUR EX-LOVER, YOU HAVE STILL RESONANCES REGARDING THE SITUATION YOU LIVED WITH HIM AND THIS IS ALSO THE OLD HOUSE AND THE IRON ROOF THAT YOU HAVE NEGLECTED... SOMETIMES YOU CAN LET EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES, ANGER, MEMORIES OF BEING COMPLICATED ENTER IN YOUR THOUGHTS... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... THAT IS WHY YOU WANTED TO HAVE "HIGH WALLS" IN THE PICTURE... TO PROTECT YOUR INTIMACY... I'm pretty angry right now. I went in front of these two, I poured beer cans on their faces, then I threw objects around at my ex. When I throw an object, I put a lot of force but somehow I can't hit the person's face even if I have the right direction. It's only a small hit, doesn't affect much. THIS SHOWS HOW YOU DEAL WITH YOURSELF AND ALSO WITH OTHERS WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY AND ARE OPERATING WITH THE ENERGY OF YOUR INNER EX-LOVER AND AN INNER UNKNOWN MAN.

AND REMEMBER THAT IT WAS AN EXPERIMENTATION FOR YOUR SOUL, WHAT YOU HAVE LIVED WITH HIM... AND WITH TIME, EFFORTS, UNDERSTANDING YOU CAN GRADUALLY TRANSCEND THE MEMORIES AND THE LAW OF RESONANCE WILL REALLY HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT, IT WAS YOUR MEMORIES THAT ATTRACTED THIS SITUATION AND YOU HAVE ALL THE TOOLS TO TRANSFORM IT... Inside I still remember the mistakes of my ex, I still have feelings of hating this person that wants revenge. YES, WE UNDERSTAND... AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU CAN EXPLORE YOUR MEMORIES VIA THE LAW OF RESONANCE TO KNOW WHY YOU STILL HAVE ANGER... AND YOU CAN SEE HIM AS A PART OF YOU... YOU CAN REMIND YOURSELF THAT "THE OTHER PERSON IS ME, HE/SHE IS SHOWING THE PERCENTAGE OF MEMORIES IN ME" AND THEN GRADUALLY YOU CAN TRANSFORM THAT ANGER INTO UNDERSTANDING, INTO WISDOM... Then I closed the door and going up. I went upstairs to get ready for bed. Actually, my ex-lover understands this house very well, maybe this person used to live there before. So, even though the door was closed, my ex could still enter the house, and so did the other man, they followed me. But they just go into the house, they find a place to rest and they don't do anything to me. THIS PART OF THE DREAM SHOWS THAT THOSE NEGATIVE MEMORIES REPRESENTED BY YOUR EX-LOVER AND THIS UNKNOWN MAN CAN ENTER IN YOUR INNER STRUCTURE AND THEY CAN STILL AFFECT YOU... THE IMPRINTS OF PAST ACTIONS AND THEIR REPERCUSSIONS FOLLOW US IN EACH LIFETIME UNLESS WE CHOOSE TO TRANSCEND OUR MEMORIES. HERE UP ABOVE IS SHOWING YOU THAT YOU CAN TRY TO ESCAPE YOUR MEMORIES BY ELEVATING TO THE WORLD OF THOUGHTS, BUT THE MEMORIES ARE STILL THERE... WAITING TO BE TRANSFORMED.... Sometime later, in the middle of the night, THE SEEDS WHICH CAN MANIFEST IN FUTURE, IF THE AVOIDANCE/ESCAPE OF MEMORIES CONTINUES I heard a noise and I went down, and the two of them also got down. Suddenly, some people came to assassinate us. HERE YOU ARE SHOWN THE MEMORIES OF VIOLENCE AND DEEP HARSHNESS WITH OTHERS AND YOURSELF AND ALSO HOW YOU CAN REPRESS CERTAIN NEGATIVE MEMORIES... SOMETIMES YOU WOULD LIKE TO REPRESS THE SUFFERING THAT YOU HAVE LIVED WITH YOUR EX-LOVER BECAUSE YOU HAVE CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES UNDERSTANDING THE REASON FOR THIS ORDEAL... They pointed guns [- abuse of power, instinctual needs, destructive emissivity YES... ] at us. At this point, the other two men ran out of the house, but the other man has shot dead afterward. The leader of this group was about to shoot me but I dodged, I stood right next to the leader. At this moment, part of me is both controlling and influencing this man so that he can't shoot me, but he stands right next to me, even though I don't touch him, we're just next to each other. There were times when the leader pointed the gun at me but I manipulated him to point the gun the other way, as if he couldn't kill me. YOU SEE THAT YOU CAN BE VERY SMART AND INTELLIGENT SO AS TO AVOID AGGRESSIVITY OF OTHERS, YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU HAVE THE POWER TO INFLUENCE OTHERS BUT IT IS MORE A NOTION OF REJECTING THE FAULT ON OTHERS INSTEAD OF A REAL TRANSFORMATION... SO INSTEAD OF REPRESSING HARSHNESS, ANGER, YOU CAN USE YOUR INTELLIGENCE TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THOSE NEGATIVE MEMORIES TO GRADUALLY CLEANSE THESE MEMORIES AND THEIR RELATED PATTERNS IN LIFE... After that, a few people came, they were the accomplices of this group people, standing in front of me and the leader. They asked the leader why he didn't kill me, while I stood right next to him, I was on the left and he was on the right. I feel like I can control the leader and his gun. So I feel very safe right now, because I'm on the same side as the leader, and it seems my ex has run away. THERE ARE MEMORIES OF AGGRESSIVITY, REPRESSION THAT FURTHER AFFECT YOUR INNER PEACE, BUT YOUR MANIPULATIONS AND ESCAPISM MAKE YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE OVERCOME THIS VIOLENCE AND HARSHNESS. BUT THIS IS FOR SOME TIME AND THESE MEMORIES CAN AGAIN COME BACK AND AFFECT YOUR EMOTIONS AND MANIFESTATIONS.... AND IT IS ALSO A WARNING FOR YOUR SOUL BECAUSE YOU CAN LET ENTER CERTAIN NEGATIVE MEMORIES IN YOU THINKING THAT YOU ARE SOMEHOW RIGHT SINCE YOU NO LONGER FEEL THE DIFFICULTIES REPRESENTED BY YOUR EX-LOVER... BUT THIS ANGER IS REPRESSED.... I abused my power to make a part of my masculinity disappear (the dead man) to balance myself. And at the end of the dream, I almost chased away the rest of the masculinity, I control all the men in the dream which means my femininity is controlling the masculinity, making it suppress or disappear to not exposed. HERE IT IS RIGHT TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE THAT YOU STOPPED THOSE MEN, BUT THE END OF THE DREAM SHOWS NO RESOLUTION BECAUSE IN THAT KIND OF SITUATION, YOU SHOULD CALL YOUR INNER POLICE :-) IT'S AN INVITATION FROM THE UP ABOVE TO KEEP DOING MEDITATION AND CHANTING TO CLEANSE THESE MEMORIES OF AGGRESSIVITY AND HARSHNESS... THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT DREAM, NHU. IT UNFOLDS MEMORIES HIDDEN IN THE UNCONSCIOUS. AND REMEMBER THAT, THIS DREAM IS A PERCENTAGE OF WHO YOU ARE... AND ONCE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TRANSFORM THAT, YOU BUILD A STABLE INNER PEACE...

    "dream_text": "SO THE FIRST SCENE SHOWS YOUR INNER WORLD WHEN YOU ARE AT WORK OR IN A LEARNING PROCESS There was a white house with a beautiful lake in front of the house. THE LAKE SHOWS YOUR EMOTIONAL LEVEL... AND THE NOTION OF PICTURE SHOWS THAT YOU ARE STUDYING CERTAIN STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP IN YOU... SUCH AS A BEAUTIFUL INNER AND SPIRITUAL (WHITE) STRUCTURE WITH CALM EMOTIONS (LAKE)... The house is on the dirt road, like in the countryside, across the road is a field. The house is surrounded by white high walls. HERE IN THE PLUS THE WHITE HOUSE SHOWS THE SPIRITUAL VALUES, PEACE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP REGARDING YOUR INTIMACY BUT SINCE THEY ARE HIGH WALLS, IT'S LIKE MAKING A BOUNDARY AROUND YOURSELF SO AS NOT TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO ENTER INTO YOUR PERSONAL SPACE... YOU ARE SHOWN A NEED FOR OVER-PROTECTING YOUR INTIMACY... AND THE NOTION OF COUNTRYSIDE + DIRTY ROAD MEANS THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES THAT YOU CAN LIVE IN THE SOCIAL LEVEL, HAVING DIFFICULTIES TO RENEW CERTAIN CONCEPTS (COUNTRYSIDE), HAVING A DIFFICULTY TO TAKE CARE OF THE WAY YOU ADVANCE IN LIFE, ETC. The last segment is when I go home. This house is just a brick house, not whitewashed. SO HOME IS WHERE YOU COME BACK TO YOUR INNER SPACE. YOU ARE REACHING TO THE MEMORIES OF YOUR INTIMACY AND BY RETURNING HOME, YOU ARE RETURNING IN THE ROOT CAUSE OF CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES THAT YOU SAW IN THE FIRST SCENE... . The house has a corrugated iron roof, surrounded by corrugated iron. THE CORRUGATION HAPPENS BECAUSE OF THE CONTACT BETWEEN IRON AND OXYGEN, IT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE NEGLECTED ALSO YOUR INNER ROOF... AND THE ROOF IS RELATED TO YOUR THOUGHTS BUT ALSO THE PROTECTION... SO IT MEANS THAT CERTAIN NEGATIVE MEMORIES CAN ENTER IN YOUR THOUGHTS... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... . Around the house are trees, bushes and many tall trees like in the middle of a forest. SO YOU ALSO SEE AN ASPECT WHERE YOU CAN BE WITHDRAWN INTO YOURSELF, WHERE YOU SOMETIMES PREFER TO WITHDRAW YOURSELF FROM SOCIETY... BECAUSE OF YOUR SENSITIVITY AND THE FOREST ALSO SHOWS THE MEMORIES RELATED TO CERTAIN ASPECTS THAT ARE UNCONSCIOUS AND THAT TOUCHES YOUR INSTINCTUAL NEEDS AND EMOTIONAL NEEDS.... It shows my inner intimacy is too old, not cared for and perfected, neglected (image of the house has not been whitewashed). Compared to when I go to work/study, I show a beautiful, simple and luxurious, discreet (high-walled white house), showing how I ascend on the social level. YES VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD... YOU CAN SEE A CERTAIN DISCREPANCY BETWEEN WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP (PICTURE) AND WHAT KIND OF MEMORIES YOU STILL HAVE INSIDE... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... When I got home it was almost dark, SO YOU ARE REACHING TO THE UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES... IT SHOWS PATTERNS THAT YOU ARE NOT ALWAYS AWARE OF... I I saw on the porch with my ex-lover [+ gentle, obedient, simple, loyal ] [- unfaithful, unclear, complicated ] and a friend (a man I don't know) drinking. YOU ARE ALSO BEING SHOWN AN UNKNOWN ASPECT OF YOU WHERE YOU ARE NOURISHING EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES AND HERE YOU SEE ALSO THAT YOU HAVE MEMORIES RELATED TO YOUR EX-LOVER, YOU HAVE STILL RESONANCES REGARDING THE SITUATION YOU LIVED WITH HIM AND THIS IS ALSO THE OLD HOUSE AND THE IRON ROOF THAT YOU HAVE NEGLECTED... SOMETIMES YOU CAN LET EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES, ANGER, MEMORIES OF BEING COMPLICATED ENTER IN YOUR THOUGHTS... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... THAT IS WHY YOU WANTED TO HAVE \"HIGH WALLS\" IN THE PICTURE... TO PROTECT YOUR INTIMACY... I'm pretty angry right now. I went in front of these two, I poured beer cans on their faces, then I threw objects around at my ex. When I throw an object, I put a lot of force but somehow I can't hit the person's face even if I have the right direction. It's only a small hit, doesn't affect much. THIS SHOWS HOW YOU DEAL WITH YOURSELF AND ALSO WITH OTHERS WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY AND ARE OPERATING WITH THE ENERGY OF YOUR INNER EX-LOVER AND AN INNER UNKNOWN MAN. YOU CAN BE TOO HARSH AND TOUGH ON YOURSELF AND OTHERS AND YOU CAN START TO REPRESS CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES INSTEAD OF UNDERSTANDING IT AND TRANSFORMING IT WITH PATIENCE AND SELF-COMPASSION... AND REMEMBER THAT IT WAS AN EXPERIMENTATION FOR YOUR SOUL, WHAT YOU HAVE LIVED WITH HIM... AND WITH TIME, EFFORTS, UNDERSTANDING YOU CAN GRADUALLY TRANSCEND THE MEMORIES AND THE LAW OF RESONANCE WILL REALLY HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT, IT WAS YOUR MEMORIES THAT ATTRACTED THIS SITUATION AND YOU HAVE ALL THE TOOLS TO TRANSFORM IT...

title_pdf: 12 Dream - Revenge and run away. last case id: C0186. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 28 May 2021 Angel: 43 Veuliah Dream mood: Interesting, happy, scare, anger, hatred, observing, loving, wise Dream and Analysis: ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU, There are 2 people (I don't know them): HERE YOU ARE EXPLORING UNKNOWN/HIDDEN ASPECT OF YOU WHICH IS RELATED TO YOUR INNER WORLD AND THE CORRESPONDING ACTIONS 1 man and 1 woman. They are lovers. They are in a slightly dark room, in a house (unconscious). YES, AN UNKNOWN ASPECT OF YOUR INTIMACY This is daytime. SO THIS SIGNIFIES THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF THESE DYNAMICS IN YOUR LIFE OR YOU MIGHT EXPERIENCE SUCH ENERGY OR MAY PROJECT THIS ENERGY ON OTHERS... They are taking revenge on those who have hurt them, they revenge in work, in the marketplace. This man is a businessman, he also has a dark force behind him, like the mafia. This woman knows a lot about his work and personal, even though she doesn't know it all. -> 2 people represent my 2 polarities. The man is the same as my imagination when I was a child. AND SINCE HE WAS ALREADY IN YOUR IMAGINATION WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD, IT MEANS THAT YOU WERE CARRYING THESE MEMORIES FROM THE PAST AND IT CAN AFFECT YOUR PRESENT MOMENT... WE CAN IMAGINE ONLY THAT WHICH IS ALREADY IN OUR UNCONSCIOUS... SO THIS MAFIA ENERGY REPRESENTS AN ASPECT IN YOU WHO HAS DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING THE LAW OF RESONANCE, THE LAW OF KARMA, THE DIVINE LAWS. AND YOU SEE THAT THE WISH TO TAKE REVENGE IS COMING FROM FEELING HURT, FEELING THAT WE ARE THE VICTIM. BUT THE DIVINE LAWS HELP US TO REMIND THAT ONE IS A VICTIM BECAUSE HE/SHE HAS BEEN A PERPETRATOR TOO.... I always think about becoming a boss of mafia. I want to revenge on people unconsciously. But I don't who I want to revenge. WHENEVER YOU FEEL THIS ENERGY YOU CAN REMIND YOURSELF OF THE LAW OF RESONANCE AND CAN DO THE MANTRA CHANTING TO GRADUALLY TRANSCEND THESE THOUGHTS IN THE LIGHT OF KNOWLEDGE... BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT IN YOUR MEMORIES, YOU HAVE REBELLIOUS MEMORIES AND CERTAIN PARTS IN YOU ARE READY TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO SATISFY INSTINCTUAL NEEDS... And the woman is also a part of mine when I grow up, I think I don't have enough talent to be the boss of mafia, then I want to become the woman beside him who can help him in work. YOU DO NOT NEED ANY SUCH TALENT TO BECOME LIKE THAT NHU, RATHER YOU NEED TO DEVELOP A TALENT TO TRANSCEND THESE NEEDS AND IT MEANS ALSO THAT YOU CAN NOURISH CERTAIN PATTERNS OF REVENGE IN YOU, BECAUSE YOU CAN BE TOO FOCUS ON YOUR NEEDS, ON THE RESULTS (MAFIA) AND APPLY YOUR OWN RULES SO AS TO GET WHAT YOU WISH... AT TIMES... AND IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... They are phoning (connect and communication) a few people who were also business partners. SO THE MEMORIES OF HURT AND REVENGE CAN CONNECT TO MANY MEMORIES, MANY PARTS OF YOURSELF AND YOU CAN SOMETIMES FEEL THESE DYNAMICS WHEN YOU ARE IN THE SOCIAL LEVEL, WANTING TO DEAL, EXCHANGE WITH OTHERS (BUSINESS PARTNERS)... They had prepared everything for revenge in advance, just waiting for the time to announce. They call others and hinting about receiving retribution, while the other side still doesn't know what happened. Then they hang off. After only a few minutes, the man's phone rang again and again, but the man didn't pick up. Because he knew that the other person was getting revenge and they begged him for help. This man put his phone aside and put it on silent mode. THIS SHOWS THAT A PART OF YOU NEEDS TO TAKE REVENGE AND THERE CAN BE MEMORIES IN YOU THAT FEEL WRONGED . IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL AND FOCUSED ON CLEANSING THESE MEMORIES. THE MEMORIES ALSO SHOW COLDNESS TOWARDS OTHER PEOPLE. YOU MAY SOMETIMES EXPERIENCE THIS WITHIN YOU OR YOU MIGHT EXPERIENCE A KIND OF COLDNESS AND REVENGEFUL NATURE INSIDE SOMETIMES.... AND YOU SHOULD ALSO REMEMBER NHU, THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE BEGGING FOR HELP ARE ALSO YOU. SO EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY FEEL REVENGEFUL BUT SIMULTANEOUSLY YOU FEEL HELPLESS AND FEARFUL TOO... AND REMEMBER THAT IT IS A PERCENTAGE OF YOU... ONCE TRANSFORMED, YOU CAN USE THE INTELLIGENCE OF THESE 2 UNKNOWN PARTS OF YOU NOT TO PREPARE EVIL, REVENGE BUT TO PREPARE AN ALTRUISTIC PROJECT THAT CAN HELP PEOPLE :-) F As an act of victory, the man and woman made love (renew, relax, an act of intimacy between two lovers of the highest degree BUT HERE IT IS MORE THE NEGATIVE ASPECT OF MAKING LOVE... YOU ARE SHOWN THAT THESE UNKNOWN PARTS OF YOU CAN BE HAPPY TO CREATE FEAR IN OTHERS.... BECAUSE CREATING FEAR CAN GIVE YOU A LOT OF ATTENTION AND FORCES... TEMPORARILY... AND MAKING LOVE SHOWS THAT IT TOUCHES THE CORE OF YOUR MASCULINE AND FEMININE POLARITIES... SO WHEN YOU ARE ABLE TO CREATE FEAR, IT CAN CREATE SATISFACTION... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... AND THIS DREAM IS A REAL BLESSING FOR YOUR SOUL... BECAUSE YOU ARE NOW ABLE TO SEE THAT FROM YOUR UNCONSCIOUS... AND BY SEEING THAT, YOU CAN TRANSFORM THOSE PATTERNS...) in another room HERE MAKING LOVE IS ALSO CONNECTED TO SATISFYING THE INSTINCTUAL, ANIMALISTIC NEEDS BY HURTING OTHERS... AT TIMES... This was their first time, even though they had known each other for a long time. For women, this man is very handsome, gallant, elegant, very respectful of women and knows how to behave, know how to be gentle. And this man has always been clear about giving: what he gets from others, he will return something similar, like revenge, he doesn't have much tolerance. YOU SEE THE DUALITIES HERE...THE MAN IS GENTLE AND ALSO REVENGEFUL SO THE GENTLENESS IS A FACADE HIDING THE INNER ANGER AND THE REVENGEFUL ASPECT . SO SOMETIMES, YOU CAN FEEL ANGER TOWARDS CERTAIN PEOPLE, BUT YOU MAY SHOW GENTLENESS OUTSIDE. ALSO, YOU CAN BE TOO GENTLE TO THOSE PARTS OF YOU WHO FEEL VICTIMIZED AND MAY NOT REMIND YOURSELF OF THE LAW OF RESONANCE...AND REMEMBER IT IS A PERCENTAGE IN YOU...This woman always trusts the man, she trusts almost absolutely, she believes and loves him. Meanwhile, this woman is also a smart, thoughtful and righteous person, so she sometimes listens and gives suggestions in this man's work. BUT HERE WE CAN'T SEE THESE QUALITIES IN THIS LADY RATHER SHE IS SUPPORTING THE DARKNESS IN THE MAN WHICH IS HARMFUL...SO YOU SEE THAT FROM INSIDE, SOMETIMES YOU CAN ENCOURAGE WRONG PATTERNS, WRONG-DOING... IT IS LIKE CERTAIN THOUGHTS, EMOTIONS MAY SEEM PLEASANT AND CONDUCIVE BUT THEY MAY NOT BE RIGHT AND MAY INDUE REVENGEFUL FEELING IN YOU...SOMETIMES... SO YOU CAN CERTAIN LACK OF DISCERNMENT REGARDING NEGATIVITY... SOMETIMES YOU CAN NOURISH NEGATIVITY WITHOUT NOTICING... SINCE IT GIVES YOU A PLEASANT FEELING, IT GIVES THE SENSATION TO BECOME ONE, THE SENSATION OF UNITY (MAKING LOVE)... -> On the unconscious level, I have lack of love and lack of tolerance, while I need to work with karma of revenge, so I push and revenge myself too, I tend to make everything satisfy with inner by wrong way. I only focus on result. YES, IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD... YOU MAY SOMETIMES BE DRIVEN BY VICTIMHOOD, WHICH EVENTUALLY TURNS INTO ANGER, AGGRESSION, AND REVENGEFUL ASPECT . AND THIS IS WONDERFUL THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF THAT... CONGRATULATIONS FOR YOUR HUMILITY... AND YOU HAVE THE POWER TO TRANSFORM THOSE NEGATIVE MEMORIES SO AS TO CREATE A BEAUTIFUL LIFE... SO INSTEAD OF NURTURING THESE NEGATIVE THOUGHTS AND PATTERNS, THERE IS A NEED TO BE MORE AWARE TO DO THE CHANTING IN ORDER TO CONCENTRATE YOUR INTENTION OF TRANSFORMATION ... After they made love, the woman gets up to cook with the maid, it is still daytime. Then, this man gets up and being about to turn on the light switch in the corner to put on his shirt. Accidentally he is caught at the table in that corner. There is a window in this corner where this man could be seen by outsiders, dimly. Incidentally, the house right next to the woman's house is her sister's house. 2 windows can be seen each other. It is both a bedroom. And her sister (I don't know her) was also one of the people this man avenged. Although the woman knows this, she doesn't stop her. She thought this man did the right thing. Because according to the law of cause and effect, you will reap what you sow. THIS SHOWS HOW YOU CAN BE SOMETIMES TOO TOUGH ON YOURSELF OR ON OTHERS. YES WE REAP WHAT WE SOW, BUT WE ARE NOT IN CHARGE TO GIVE BACK TO A PERSON WHAT HE/SHE HAS DONE NEGATIVELY... WE DON'T TAKE REVENGE... BECAUSE IT WILL JUST ACTIVATE ANOTHER CYCLE OF VICTIM/AGGRESSOR... AS AN INITIATE, EACH PERSON IS AN ASPECT OF US, SHOWING TO US OUR PERCENTAGES OF DISTORTIONS AND QUALITIES... Meanwhile, her sister knows she like this man but does not know the level of closeness between the two. SO YOU SEE ALSO IN A PART OF YOUR INNER COUPLE HOW THINGS CAN BE COMPLICATED IF YOU LET THESE NEGATIVE FEELINGS SPREAD IN YOUR CONSCIENCE... YOU CAN LACK DISCERNMENT THINKING THAT YOU ARE RIGHT... AT TIMES... BECAUSE OF A DIFFICULTY TO SELF- QUESTION CERTAIN PATTERNS... -> I am too focused on the law of cause and effect and do not understand the mistakes of others, showing that I do not understand that I receive the damage caused by my karma, it is also a part of me, but I am blaming others and avenging them. YES, RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD Her sister accidentally caught a glimpse of this man in the other girl's bedroom, shirtless. Her sister dimly guesses and is looking for this man. This man also accidentally sees her sister, quickly hid and informed the woman about this. And he wants to run away and wants the girl to find a way to cope. He packs his things into a bag and runs upstairs (go into unconscious deeper FLEEING CERTAIN MEMORIES, BEING AIRIER... BEING MORE IN THE THOUGHT...). When he looks out at the balcony (thinking, thoughts, relax) in front of the house, he sees her sister standing right in front of the gate. If she just looks up, she will see him, although entangled by a few branches, was very low. He immediately bent down. Her sister is on the phone, probably calling the girl. But perhaps contact could not be reached, her sister immediately runs through the gate to enter the house. The man follows the balcony upstairs, goes left, toward the railing, and jumps into the yard next door to hide. Although the height is quite tall high, he is fine and escapes successfully. SO WHEN YOU FEEL WRONGED AND 23/07/2025, 11:11 Revenge and run away | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/83420 2/4 YOU KNOW THE LAW OF KARMA, AND STILL YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO APPLY THE DIVINE LAWS AND FEEL LIKE TAKING REVENGE ON OTHERS OR RECALL HOW YOU WOULD HAVE DONE ANY HARM TO SOMEONE, YOU WISH TO ESCAPE THIS MEMORY BY ELEVATING TO THE LEVEL OF THOUGHTS AND ESCAPING... BUT YOUR INNER WORLD DOES NOT LETS YOU BE AT PEACE... BUT ON THE LEVEL OF ACTION (MAN) YOU STILL FEEL HURT AND ANGRY FOR BEING VICTIMIZED...IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... From this dream, I think it shows I did manipulate my 2 polarities along with my need and desire. I lack love, lack of tolerance, lack of understanding about karma, so I tend to blame everyone and myself too. YES, YOU ARE SHOWN CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES TO APPLY THE DIVINE LAWS. BUT YOU ARE GRADUALLY ABLE TO COME BACK TO YOURSELF WITH TIME... AND ALSO BY UNDERSTANDING THAT TAKING REVENGE WILL NOT LEAD YOU TO A HAPPY LIFE... IT IS QUITE THE OPPOSITE... IT MEANS ALSO THAT SOMETIMES NEGATIVITY CAN BE STRONGER THAN YOUR SPIRITUAL VALUES... IN A CERTAIN CASE... Besides that, on the day that I received this dream, on the company I used provocative, unkind words for one of my new co-workers. To me, this person is a person who likes to show off, likes to be the boss while not having the knowledge and thinking to match, he likes to pretend. And I gave his work commentaries on his work. In terms of effective comments, I think I'm right, but in terms of speaking, I resonated with his emission and I also show off to be his boss without him realizing it on this issue. It makes me feel angry inside. I think this dream can explain my angry because I have a percentage of show off, be a boss and not having enough talent to be, so I attracted him. YOU HAVE WELL CONNECTED YOUR DREAM AND THE CONCRETE REALITY... YOU HAVE A PROFOUND HUMILITY TO RECOGNIZE THAT... AND YES... THIS DREAM IS SHOWING WHAT ARE THE MEMORIES THAT RESONATE WITH HIM... IT IS THE "MAFIA ENERGY" IN YOU, WANTING TO APPLY YOUR OWN RULES AND IN THOSE MOMENTS, YOU CAN HAVE CERTAIN THOUGHTS WHERE YOU THINK YOU ARE RIGHT... BUT ACCORDING TO THIS DREAM, YOU ARE SHOWN HIDDEN INTENTIONS THAT YOU ARE REVEALED TO YOU... I always feel scared when I go into the unconscious, like when I interpret this dream. I feel scared when I am alone, especially, I am afraid of ghosts. I UNDERSTAND DEAR NHU... AND IT IS NORMAL TO BE AFRAID... AND THE MORE YOU WILL BRING THE LIGHT OF KNOWLEDGE IN YOUR UNCONSCIOUS, THE EASIER IT WILL BE TO TRANSFORM CERTAIN NEGATIVE MEMORIES... THAT IS WHY, WHILE YOU ARE VISITING NEGATIVE MEMORIES, IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER YOUR QUALITIES... AND THE ANGELS WILL GRADUALLY REVEAL TO YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW FOR YOUR EVOLUTION... STEP BY STEP... AND THE GHOSTS ARE OUR UNSOLVED ISSUES AND MEMORIES FROM THE PAST. SUCH MEMORIES ARE THE ONES THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCUMULATED FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME AND NOW THEY ARE SHOWING UP IN A METAPHYSICAL FORM... AND METAPHYSICAL FORM MEANS THAT THOSE MEMORIES ARE NOT YET DENSIFIED IN MATTER... THESE MEMORIES ARE IN PREPARATION TO TAKE FORM IN MATTER... AND YOU CAN DO THE MANTRA CHANTING WHILE UNDERSTANDING THESE MEMORIES... AND THESE MEMORIES ARE PART OF YOU DEAR NHU, THEY JUST NEED TO BE UNDERSTOOD WITH COMPASSION, WISDOM, AND LOVE I rarely watch ghost or horror movies because I'm very prone to haunting for days, making me lose sleep. Often, when I listen to meditation music with the words of some other party, I also have a feeling of fear, like I imagine someone or some bad spirit being next to me. And I can't explain it or transcend it. AND IT IS BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE CERTAIN LACK OF DISCERNMENT REGARDING CERTAIN INTENTION, YOUR SOUL KNOWS THAT LISTENING TO A GUIDED MEDITATION CAN HELP YOU TO EXPLORE DEEP MEMORIES... SO YOU ARE SHOWN CERTAIN RESISTANCE TO VISIT NEGATIVE MEMORIES... AND THE BAD SPIRIT IS MAINLY RELATED TO WHAT WE CALL INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS AND NEGATIVE MEMORIES FROM YOUR UNCONSCIOUS THAT EMERGE... AND YOU WILL SEE HOW THE SYMBOLIC LANGUAGE WILL HELP YOU TO DEPROGRAM CERTAIN FEARS... IT IS LIKE THE DOCTOR WHO STUDIED PROFOUNDLY ILLNESS... ONE DAY, HE/SHE IS NOT AFRAID OF ILLNESS BUT UNDERSTANDS THE ILLNESS AND HOW TO TREAT THEM... IT IS THE SAME FOR US IN THE SPIRITUAL LEVEL... YOUR CONSISTENCY IS HELPING YOU TO TRANSCEND PROGRESSIVELY ALL THESE FEARS. THIS IS A PROFOUND DREAM WHICH YOU HAVE RECEIVED. IT SHOWS HOW CERTAIN MEMORIES CAN SOMETIMES TRIGGER REVENGEFUL BEHAVIOR IN YOU. AND YOUR THOUGHTS WILL MAKE YOU FEEL AS IF YOU ARE NOT WRONG. IT'S LIKE ESCAPING FROM WHAT IS RIGHT. SO YOU CAN BE AWARE AND CAREFUL NOT TO PROJECT YOUR INNER HELPLESSNESS, ANGER, AND VICTIMHOOD AS REVENGE ONTO OTHERS...NEGATIVE MEMORIES CAN BE TRICKY SOMETIMES... IT IS A BEAUTIFUL INVITATION FROM UP ABOVE TO BRING THE LIGHT OF KNOWLEDGE IN THESE AREAS OF YOUR UNCONSCIOUS... WITH PATIENCE... ANGELIC DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR DISCERNMENT SO AS TO DEEPEN YOUR SPIRITUAL VALUES AND FACE NEGATIVITY WITH COMPASSION AND COURAGE... WITH HARIEL ÂN PS: DEAR NHU, WE INVITE YOU TO USE THE APPROPRIATE STYLE, IN THE PLEX, THERE IS A TUTORIAL THAT EXPLAINS HOW TO DO IT... OTHERWISE, WE WILL RETURN YOU BACK YOUR DREAM SO THAT YOU CAN PUT THE APPROPRIATE STYLE FOR EACH KEY SYMBOL WHETHER IT IS NEGATIVE, POSITIVE, ETC. THANK YOU FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING

They are phoning (connect and communication) a few people who were also business partners. They had prepared everything for revenge in advance, just waiting for the time to announce. They call others and hinting about receiving retribution, while the other side still doesn't know what happened. Then they hang off. After only a few minutes, the man's phone rang again and again, but the man didn't pick up. Because he knew that the other person was getting revenge and they begged him for help. This man put his phone aside and put it on silent mode. As an act of victory, the man and woman made love (renew, relax, an act of intimacy between two lovers of the highest degree) in another room. This was their first time, even though they had known each other for a long time. For women, this man is very handsome, gallant, elegant, very respectful of women and knows how to behave, know how to be gentle. And this man has always been clear about giving: what he gets from others, he will return something similar, like revenge, he doesn't have much tolerance. This woman always trusts the man, she trusts almost absolutely, she believes and loves him. Meanwhile, this woman is also a smart, thoughtful and righteous person, so she sometimes listens and gives suggestions in this man's work. On the unconscious level, I have lack of love and lack of tolerance, while I need to work with karma of revenge, so I push and revenge myself too, I tend to make everything satisfy with inner by wrong way. I only focus on result. After they made love, the woman gets up to cook with the maid, it is still daytime. Then, this man gets up and being about to turn on the light switch in the corner to put on his shirt. Accidentally he is caught at the table in that corner. There is a window in this corner where this man could be seen by outsiders, dimly. Incidentally, the house right next to the woman's house is her sister's house. 2 windows can be seen each other. It is both a bedroom. And her sister (I don't know her) was also one of the people this man avenged. Although the woman knows this, she doesn't stop her. She thought this man did the right thing. Because according to the law of cause and effect, you will reap what you sow. Her sister accidentally caught a glimpse of this man in the other girl's bedroom, shirtless. Her sister dimly guesses and is looking for this man. This man also accidentally sees her sister, quickly hid and informed the woman about this. And he wants to run away and wants the girl to find a way to cope. He packs his things into a bag and runs upstairs. When he looks out at the balcony in front of the house, he sees her sister standing right in front of the gate. If she just looks up, she will see him, although entangled by a few branches, was very low. He immediately bent down. Her sister is on the phone, probably calling the girl. But perhaps contact could not be reached, her sister immediately runs through the gate to enter the house. The man follows the balcony upstairs, goes left, toward the railing, and jumps into the yard next door to hide. Although the height is quite tall high, he is fine and escapes successfully.",

title_pdf: 13 Life - Report. last case id: C0187. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 18 June 2021 Angel: 21 Nelkhael Dream mood: Tired, Confuse Dream and Analysis: Hello Professors, ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU, This week I chanted Angel 21 Nelkhael with the intention: please help me transform distortion about Difficulties in apprenticeship. And this week I can't remember dreams, but all the week I have urgent tasks [- out of control on the advanced way, on work, no preparation, lack of motivation ] that makes import and export goods reports [- too focus on matter, don't have capacity to use and can't manage them, lack resources and confidence, jealous, envy, fear, anxiety regarding the future; manipulate others, take advance of power, a tendency to waste; loss of control over matter, confusion between externally expressed energies, loss of confidence in the absence of matter ] BUT IT CAN ALSO BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW, WHICH ASPECTS IN YOU, NEED ATTENTION AND TRANSFORMATION. FOR E.G WITH THE KIND OF WORK THAT YOU ARE ENGAGED IN, IT CALLS FOR DEVELOPING YOUR ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS, LEARNING TO WORK WITH PRECISION, FLEXIBILITY, ADAPTABILITY AND FOCUS IN REAL-TIME SITUATIONS..... I have out of control with my material things, some things can happen unexpectedly and it affects my instincts energies. I have jealous at work and anxious about my career path in the future. I lack power so sometimes I had manipulated others to do things that I want. THIS SHOWS THAT UNEXPECTED THINGS CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE, ANYTIME BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS IN HOW YOU MANAGE IT, I,E IN THOSE MOMENTS WHERE YOU FEEL ANXIETY, FEAR, OR ANGER... . AS YOU SAID ABOUT MANIPULATION AND JEALOUSY , WHEN YOU START TO WORK FOR DEVELOPING QUALITIES, INSTEAD OF JEALOUSY OR MANIPULATION, YOUR FOCUS WOULD BE MORE ON CO-OPERATION, LEARNING FROM OTHERS, AND WORKING WITH THE TEAM AS A WHOLE. AND IF YOU FEEL THOSE EMOTIONS, YOU CAN TAKE A MOMENT TO INTERIORIZE, TO REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE HERE TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON... AND IT WILL GIVE YOU ANOTHER DIMENSION IN YOUR WORK... A DIMENSION THAT IS BASED ON ALTRUISM... BECAUSE JEALOUSY AND ANXIETY WILL AUTOMATICALLY LEAD TO DIFFICULTIES.... SOONER OR LATER.... IF THOSE NEGATIVE EMOTIONS ARE VERY POWERFUL YOU CAN TAKE TIME TO BREATHE DEEPLY, TO TAKE AN INTERMISSION WHILE YOU ARE MEDITATING ON YOUR EMOTIONS SO AS TO TRANSFORM THEM WITH CARING... Firstly, I was told by my superiors to check the warehouse. Then, when we finish the checking, I was asked to make goods import report. Then, I was continuing to ask for goods export report. Next, I was asked to make a report of all the documents of the order. Next, that was check difference between exported and imported goods report. A few things next. I was not told what reports I would need to make and what to do, but things just kept going and I only knew what was next after completing an assigned report, and it all had to be done right away. HERE YOU WERE GIVEN A CHANCE TO LEARN TO MANAGE YOUR INNER DATABASE ALONG WITH LEARNING TO MANAGE THE DATA AND REPORTS OF THE WAREHOUSE. SO IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN TO ORGANIZE YOUR INNER DATABASE. IT'S LEARNING TO ADAPT AS THINGS CHANGE DYNAMICALLY IN LIFE. AND YOU SEE ALSO THAT YOU CAN ENTER IN RESONANCE WITH YOUR SUPERIORS... IF YOU FEEL THAT THEY WERE TOO DEMANDING, THAT YOU DID NOT HAVE NOT ENOUGH TIME, AND THAT YOU WERE BEING RUSHED TO DO THAT, IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE ATTRACTED THIS SITUATION BY RESONANCES... IT IS BECAUSE OF CERTAIN MEMORIES IN YOU WHERE YOU CAN BE ALSO TOO DEMANDING... YOU SEE ALSO A LACK OF ACCOMPANIMENT IN THE PROCESS... SO IT SHOWS ALSO A LACK OF GLOBAL VISION IN THIS PROCESS... OF COURSE, AT THE SAME TIME IT IS GOOD TO LEARN TO BE FLEXIBLE AND NOT COUNTING YOUR EFFORTS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT THE EFFORTS WITH THE RIGHT INTENTION WILL MAKE YOU A BETTER SOUL... Because I don't have a clear direction for me in the future, so I take things to step by step, I finish one step then I think about the next step without looking more broadly at my real purpose. I don't have a clear and right intention yet, but only temporarily. I had difficulty with data collection, because from the beginning we didn't have anything, didn't have a standard system and clear process, we tinkered with it ourselves, so everything went from manual comes up, and the data source is messy to aggregate. I already know that sooner or later I will need to make these reports, and I am trying to make the data as complete as possible. However, everything was so unexpected. AND THIS SITUATION WILL HELP YOU TO BE A GOOD MANAGER FOR YOURSELF... BEING ABLE TO ANTICIPATE SITUATIONS IN ADVANCE SO AS NOT TO DO THINGS URGENTLY BUT TO WELL PREPARED YOURSELF... AND REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS IMPROVE A SITUATION WITH A DISCUSSION WITH YOUR SUPERIORS... HAVING A CONSTRUCTIVE AND HEALTHY COMMUNICATION CAN IMPROVE YOUR SITUATION... IT'S A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN TO ORGANIZE THE INNER AS WELL AS THE OUTER DATABASE. THE MORE THIS DATA IS ORGANIZED THE MORE CLARITY WILL BE THERE AND THE MORE ACCURATE THE SYSTEM CAN BECOME. IF WE LOOK AT THIS INCIDENCE AS A DREAM, THEN IT'S A REMINDER FROM THE UNIVERSE TO TEACH YOURSELF THE RIGHT MANAGEMENT OF YOUR INNER DATABASE/THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS BY FOCUSING ON ONE THING AT A TIME AND ALSO THE QUALITIES THAT YOU ARE DEVELOPING... THEN THERE WILL BE LESS CONFUSION AND MORE ACCESS TO THE INNER GUIDANCE WHILE YOU HAVE ALWAYS IN YOUR INTENTION TO DO YOUR BEST TO DEVELOP YOUR SOUL :-) I intend on correcting the over-focus on the matter, maybe I still lazy, lack motivation to empale it. THROUGH MATTER ITSELF, YOU ARE LEARNING TO IMPLEMENT THE SPIRITUAL VALUES... AND REMEMBER THAT THOSE MEMORIES OF LAZINESS, LACK OF MOTIVATION ARE EMERGING BECAUSE YOU CAN BE SOMETIMES "TOO MOTIVATE" TO FINISH A TASK, YOU CAN PERFORM TOO MUCH SO AS TO RECEIVE RECOGNITION FROM YOUR SUPERIORS... AT A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... SO THE MEMORIES OF LAZINESS ARE THERE AS A COMPENSATION... AND YOU CAN TRANSFORM IT... THAT IS FOR SURE :-) ANGELIC DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR GLOBAL VISION SO AS TO DEVELOP THE MULTIDIMENSIONS IN YOUR INNER AND OUTER WORK ANGELS MENADEL AND SEALIAH, ÂN

title_pdf: 14 Dream - In house party. last case id: C0188. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 25 June 2021 Angel: 21 Nelkhael Dream mood: Scared, affair Dream and Analysis: Hello Teachers, ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU Here is my dream. In a party in house with Europe Style, with luxury space and wine, it's a networking party [- too open with social level, let's people enter my thoughts and effect to my acts, superficial, unfocus AND YOU CAN ANALYZE THE NOTION OF LUXURY SPACE AND WINE WHICH IS RELATED TO MATERIALISTIC AND EMOTIONAL NEEDS (WINE), BEING TOO COMPLICATED WHILE YOU WOULD LIKE TO SATISFIED YOUR NEEDS (EUROPE),... YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONNECT WITH PARTS OF YOU BUT YOU ARE SHOWN CERTAIN NEGATIVE MEMORIES THAT CAN EMERGE... ] I am being there with my ex-lover. My ex brings a dagger [- too fast, too clear, too independent, too focus on matter, too simple SINCE HE HAS THE DAGGER IN HIS HANDS IT MEANS THAT SOMETIMES YOUR ACTIONS CAN BE TOO EMISSIVE AND CAN HURT OTHERS AND YOURSELF TOO... WE SEE THAT ON A SOCIAL LEVEL, YOU COULD SOMETIMES BE TOO SHARP AND THE FACT THAT IT IS YOUR EX-PARTNER, IT SHOWS THAT THESE ARE OLD MEMORIES THAT YOU VISIT IN YOU WHERE YOU COULD SOMETIMES BE JUDGMENTAL AND LACK OF DISCERNMENT... ] He plays with it in his hand and goes around in the room. HERE DESCRIBING THE MINUSES OF THE EX-LOVER WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THE MINUS IN YOUR EMISSIVITY WHEN YOU ARE IN COLLECTIVE AND TRY TO INTERACT WITH PEOPLE FOR WORK AND BUILDING NETWORK. In the social level, I have concerned too much about what people think, and I let their thoughts control me. IT RATHER SHOWS YOUR WISH TO HAVE SOCIAL ABUNDANCE BUT IT CAN PROGRAM AGGRESSIVITY, OVER-EMISSIVITY IN YOU, SINCE YOU CAN CONNECT WITH WHAT YOUR EX PARTNER REPRESENTS FOR YOU SUCH AS INFIDELITY, BEING ANGRY AT HIM, COMPLICATED COUPLE RELATIONSHIP, ETC. YOU ARE SHOWN THAT YOU CAN BE IN A DEFENSIVE MODE IN THE SOCIAL LEVEL... I have superficial and unfocus on things. At the same time, sometimes I want too clear, too fast and too independent in the social level, so I can't integrate on the social THE DREAM HERE SHOWS TOO MUCH EMISSIVITY AND WANTING TO DRAW ATTENTION TO YOURSELF, WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH ACTIONS... AT TIMES... I feel it so dangerous, so I remind him about the harm of playing with it. And his attitude is very childish, disobedient, joke with people. He didn't listen to my prompts. I can't remember the end of the dream. DEAR NHU, YOU CAN APPLY THE APPROPRIATE STYLE... THESE ARE THE MEMORIES WHICH INTERPLAY IN YOUR ENERGY WHEN YOU ARE IN A GROUP WHERE EVERYONE IS FOCUSSED ON PARTYING, ENJOYING AND THUS LIVING A LITTLE SUPERFICIAL LIFE AT THE MOMENT. IN SUCH SITUATIONS, YOUR INNER EX-LOVER ENERGY TRIES TO TAKE OVER. YOU MAY BE CONSCIOUS OF THAT IN THOSE MOMENTS BUT HAVING DIFFICULTIES TO ACT WITH WISDOM SO BY RESONANCES YOU CAN, SOMETIMES, ACT WITH AN ENERGY OF SUPERFICIALITY, AND ATTENTION SEEKING ATTITUDE IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... SO YOU SEE ALSO THAT THERE YOUR MAIN CONSCIENCE IS AWARE THAT HAVING OVER-EMISSIVITY, AGGRESSIVITY, TRIVIALIZING NEGATIVE BEHAVIORS CAN BE HARMFUL TO YOU... BUT THIS INNER EX-PARTNER IS NOT AWARE... SO IT SHOWS THAT THERE ARE SOME MEMORIES IN YOU WHERE YOU CAN BE ALSO UNAWARE OF CERTAIN MEMORIES OF OVER-EMISSIVITY, COMPLICATED INSTINCTUAL NEEDS, EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES (WINE)... AND IT CAN LEAD YOU TO A LACK OF RESPONSIBILITIES, TO A DIFFICULTY TO DISCERN NEGATIVITY... SINCE THE DAGGER IS NOT TO BE PLAYED WITH, IT CAN HARM SOMEONE SERIOUSLY. SO PRESENCE OF THE DAGGER IN THE PARTY IS A SIGN OF ANGER, AGGRESSION WHICH IS HIDDEN UNDER THE ACT OF JOKES, CHILDISHNESS ETC. SINCE THE DAGGER IS HELD IN HAND SO IT SHOWS THE HURTFUL WAYS OF GIVING AND RECEIVING IN THE COLLECTIVE. THAT BEING SAID, IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE NOT ONLY THESE NEGATIVE MEMORIES BUT THAT YOU HAVE PROFOUND QUALITIES IN YOU... I recognize that I couldn't integrate in the social, but a part of me still doesn't really aware of it, ignore it. Maybe the part of too lazy, too dependent... AND AS SAID ABOVE, YOU CAN ANALYZE WHAT REPRESENTS YOUR EX-LOVE PARTNER FOR YOU... YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY YOU HAVE CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES CONNECTING WITH OTHERS... SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE TOO SHARP, OR HAVING LUXURY NEEDS AND IT CAN CREATE DIFFICULTIES TO CONNECT WITH OTHER PARTS OF YOU... When I woke up in the middle of the night, I felt very scared. It is fear of the dark. I dared not move, only dared to stay still, close my eyes. I reassured myself it was just a dream. After a while, I was able to move and go back to sleep. IN SUCH MOMENTS, YOU CAN CHANT THE ANGELIC MANTRA WITH THE INTENTION OF CLEANSING AND TRANSCENDING SUCH MEMORIES. YOU ARE QUITE RECEPTIVE TO RECEIVE SUCH DREAMS NHU. SO INSTEAD OF CONSIDERING IT AS "JUST" A DREAM, CONSIDER IT AS A MESSAGE FROM THE UP ABOVE TO WORK UPON SUCH MEMORIES WITH FOCUS AND AWARENESS... AND IF YOU RECEIVE THESE KINDS OF DREAM, IT IS BECAUSE THE COSMIC INTELLIGENCE KNOW THAT YOU ARE READY TO FACE THOSE BLOCKS OF MEMORIES... THESE ARE THE MEMORIES THAT CAN GERMINATE INTO EXPERIENCES IF NOT WORKED UPON, SO WITH FOCUS AND FAITH KEEP DOING THE MANTRA CHANTING AND YOUR MEDITATIONS SO AS TO CREATE HARMONIOUS RELATIONSHIP AND DEVELOP SPIRITUAL COMMUNICATION... THE DREAM ALSO REVEALS, WHY YOU FEEL CHALLENGED AND CONFUSED WHILE ON THE JOB SOMETIMES....FOR E.G AS YOU DISCUSSED IN THE LAST DREAM JOURNAL ABOUT YOUR SITUATION AT WORK REGARDING THE IMPORT AND EXPORT... YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE "DAGGER" ENERGY YOU EXPERIENCED..., THE OVER-EMISSIVITY, THE SHARPNESS OF OTHERS WITH WHICH YOU WERE IN RESONANCES.....IT'S THE SAME DAGGER WHICH, IN SUCH SITUATIONS, YOU EXPERIENCED IN THE HANDS OF THE OTHERS... SO IT IS A GOOD INVITATION TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RESONANCES SO AS TO COME OUT OF THIS NEGATIVE CIRCLE... A WONDERFUL CLEANSING PROCESS WITH YOUR INNER EX-LOVER AND THE INNER DAGGER NEEDS TO BE DONE :-)... I scared unknown part in me, it likes a unfold, a devil or something scares me every time I want to go into the unconscious deeply. WE UNDERSTAND DEAR NHU... AND IT IS OK TO BE AFRAID... UP ABOVE IS SHOWING NEGATIVE MEMORIES PROGRESSIVELY SO THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHO YOU ARE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE YOUR LIFE ANGELICALLY... AND IT REQUIRES PERSEVERANCE, EFFORTS, DISCIPLINE AND ALSO SELF-COMPASSION... THIS WHAT AN INITIATE EXPERIENCES IN HIS/HER JOURNEY. YOU ARE ON A PROFOUND JOURNEY TO REDISCOVER YOURSELF, NHU. WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE YOUR GREAT EFFORTS... THE MANTRA WILL TRULY HELP YOU TO FOCUS YOUR INTENTION SO AS TO TRANSFORM WITH COURAGE ANY NEGATIVITIES THAT CAN EMERGE... SOMETIMES, DISCOVERING OUR MEMORIES CAN SHAKE OUR SOUL BUT WE KNOW THAT YOU HAVE THE COURAGE TO FACE YOUR MEMORIES WITH COURAGE AND UNDERSTANDING SO AS TO TRANSCEND IT WITH LOVE AND WISDOM. ONE DAY, WE ARE NO LONGER AFRAID OF EVIL BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND IT PROFOUNDLY, AND WE CAN ALCHEMIZE IT... ANGELIC CONNECTION WITH OTHERS PART OF YOU WITH DIPLOMACY, KINDNESS, RECEPTIVITY IN ORDER TO CREATE ANGELIC RELATIONSHIPS FILLED WITH RESPECT... WITH ANGELS CALIEL & LEHAHIAH ÂN

title_pdf: 15 Dream - Drying damp cloth towels. last case id: C0189. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 27 August 2021 Angel: 43 Veuliah Dream mood: Surprise, feeling good, emotional, loving, grateful Dream and Analysis: Hi teachers, ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU, Here are some scenes of my dream this week, I chant Veuliah Angel with the intention: please help me expand my reception. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL INTENTION... Dream I have to dry damp cloth towels [+ cloth towel: soothes emotions, cleans up stains (material), cleanses attachment, protection, comfort, warmth, expresses the character. This is a damp cloth towel that should be associated with emotions in protective, comforting, and soothing actions AND HERE, SINCE THE DREAM IS RATHER NEGATIVE, THE TOWELS SHOW THE WARMTH THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE... BUT BEING DAMP SHOW THAT SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE TOO EMOTIONAL, ABSORBING CERTAIN NEGATIVE EMOTIONS BY RESONANCES (TOWEL) ] They have medium-sized towels in different sizes and colors. The towels are for sale. I dry them in my living room right now. The towels are damp. I divide them up, one by one, and spread the surface, dry on the floor. SINCE THE TOWELS ARE DRIED ON THE FLOOR, IT SHOWS A LITTLE DOWN-TO-EARTH TENDENCY. IDEALLY, THE TOWELS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DRIED ON A CLEAN SURFACE/CLOTH RACK OR HANGER. THAT IS WHY WE CAN SAY THAT IT IS SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE... ... I'm gradually getting inside my emotions, in every action, event, moment. I gradually put down difficult, rigid, uncomfortable emotions, opening my heart to receive new emotions, new information, new knowledge. This also shows my intention behind this towards material needs (towels for sale). HERE YOU ARE SHOWN THAT YOU HAVE ACCUMULATED CERTAIN EMOTIONS AND THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP THE POSITIVE ASPECT OF THE TOWEL WHICH IS CLEANSING THE BODY AFTER SHOWER FOR EXAMPLE, IN A COLLECTIVE SCALE... AND YOU CAN MAKE A PARALLEL WHEN IN THE PAST YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE NOT ABLE TO FEEL EMOTIONS... IN REALITY, YOU ARE ABLE TO FEEL, IT IS BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TOO MANY EMOTIONS (DAMP) AND AS A MECHANISM OF PROTECTION, IT CREATES THE OTHER EXTREME OF BEING DRY... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... After that, I plan to stack the towels together into a stack, overlapping for the next day. Then I found out that my mother [+ generous, gentle, kind, like to help people, manages and arranges work well ] [- over loving, fierce, imposing opinions, sacrificing, talking a lot, having difficulty in receiving and listening, attaching too much importance to status and honor, attaching too much importance to what others think of themselves ] did this for me, folding them up. THE FACT THAT YOUR INNER MOTHER DID THE FOLDING OF THE TOWELS SHOWS THAT YOUR INNER MOTHER ASPECT IS PROGRESSIVELY BECOMING RECEPTIVE AND IS GETTING OPEN TO HELP AND NOURISH YOUR INNER WORLD, YOUR EMOTIONS. My mother represents my ORIGIN OF YOUR femininE POLARITY. I have expanded my receptivity by being more attentive, listening to others and listening to myself, less talking back, less resistant thoughts. I'm slowly changing them silently. YES... AND YOU CAN CONTINUE YOUR GREAT EFFORTS ON YOURSELF... BE KIND TO LIFE AND LIFE WILL BE KIND TO YOU... I see this action as something very big, I am grateful for it and my mother did it silently. Partly because it's so tiring to do it, and I need these towels to sell, they're so necessary to me. I think at that time I needed money [+ honesty, power of materialization, understanding that matter is temporal and educational, material and spiritual abundance, generosity, altruism, sharing and respect the Divine Laws HERE IT IS GREAT THAT YOU FEEL GRATITUDE IN YOU BUT THERE ARE ELEMENTS THAT CAN NEGATIVELY INFLUENCE THIS FEELING... SOMETIMES YOU CAN PROVIDE EFFORTS TO HELP YOURSELF AND OTHERS BUT BEHIND IT IS OUT OF "SACRIFICE"... AND THE NOTION OF SACRIFICING APPEARS BECAUSE THERE ARE MEMORIES OF WANTING TO BE LOVED AND APPRECIATED BY OTHERS... OF COURSE, THE POSITIVE ASPECT OF SACRIFICE IS ABOUT DEVOTION... NOT COUNTING THE EFFORTS... ] to pay my debt. AND YOU CAN ANALYZE THE SYMBOL OF DEBT... WHICH CAN SHOW THE FINANCIAL INSECURITIES, THE DIFFICULTIES MANAGING WELL YOUR RESOURCES... AND IN THE SYMBOLIC LANGUAGE, MONEY REPRESENTS ENERGY, THE FACT THAT YOU FEEL DRAINED IN THE SOCIAL SETUP, IS BECAUSE YOU CAN BE TOO FOCUSED ON MATERIALISTIC NEEDS... THE FACT THAT YOU FOUND THE FOLDING OF TOWELS TIRING, SHOWS IN A % THE RESISTANCE TO MAKE EFFORTS TO CHANGE BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOUR INNER MOTHER IS DOING THE EFFORTS... IT IS LIKE YOU ARE ABLE TO MAKE EFFORTS BUT INSIDE YOU CAN BE TIRED BECAUSE OF THE INSECURITIES, BEING FOCUSED ON THE RESULT... AND EVENTUALLY, IF THIS PERCENTAGE OF TIREDNESS GROWS, IT WILL CREATE PROBLEMS... Expanding my receptivity will help me gradually remove attachments and materialistic needs through understanding, EFFORTS, PATIENCE, AND LOVE :-)... THAT BEING SAID, MATERIALISTIC NEEDS ARE NOT ALWAYS WRONG NHU, IF THEY ARE BACKED BY THE RIGHT THOUGHT AND RIGHT INTENTION. WE ALL LIVE IN MATTER, AND THUS EACH ONE OF US WORKS TOWARDS OUR GOALS. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE INITIATE WORKS TO ALIGN THE RIGHT THOUGHT, EMOTION, AND INTENTION SO AS TO ALWAYS HAVE IN HIS HEART TO DEVELOP QUALITIES... THERE IS NOT NOTHING WRONG TO MAKE MONEY BUT WHEN IT BECOMES THE ONLY PURPOSE WHEN PEOPLE ONLY SEE MATTER, OR WHEN THEY USE MONEY FOR NEGATIVE PURPOSE, MONEY BECOMES NEGATIVE... I told this story to my two sisters. And the sisters said, don't say anything to your mother, just let it be and just receive it. This is a confirmation that I should continue to transform my receptivity HERE IT IS MORE NEGATIVE, IT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE SOMETIMES SOME DIFFICULTIES TO RECOGNIZE YOUR OWN EFFORTS OR OTHER'S EFFORTS... BECAUSE NORMALLY, YOU CAN SAY "THANK YOU" FOR THIS HELP... SO YOU CAN SEE ALSO THAT YOU CAN HAVE CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES TO COMMUNICATE POSITIVELY... AT TIMES... The next day, I continued to spread the towel out to dry. The second sister [+ sociable, tolerant, connecting people, gentle, peaceful, loving, ready to support, help people, warm, listen ] [- too gentle, too peaceful, too loving, sacrificing, enduring, overdoing everything, worrying too much ] asked me if I needed any help, I said I could do it. THIS SHOWS THAT YOU ARE GETTING THE INNER SUPPORT AND ALSO YOU FEEL SELF-SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT YOURSELF... BUT IT ALSO SUBTLY SHOWS THAT SOMETIMES YOU PREFER TO DO THINGS BY YOUR OWN AND YOU HAVE CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES ACCEPTING HELP... SO YOU ARE SHOWN CERTAIN DUALITIES SOMETIMES YOU CAN HELP TOO MUCH, SOMETIMES NOT ENOUGH... And in the dream, I remember the appearance of the number $500,000. This dream shows that I am gradually improving my receptivity. I am more open, more listening, understanding more of my difficulties and attachments to previous material needs. Now I am trying to learn to increase understanding, transform distortions and gradually change difficulties and consequences. The dream also shows my ability to self-study and self-transform, I can do it. The dream is a confirmation of the right path, the right knowledge, and the right way of doing things, encouraging me to keep working towards transformation. FOR SURE, YOU HAVE THIS GREAT POTENTIAL IN YOU, DEAR NHU... AND BY UNDERSTANDING THE DEPTH OF THIS DREAM, YOU WILL ALSO DISCOVER CERTAIN MEMORIES MENTIONED ABOVE... SO THAT YOU CAN BE AWARE OF CERTAIN MATERIALISTIC NEEDS, INSECURITIES, DIFFICULTIES WITH THE EMOTIONAL LEVEL... SO THAT YOU CAN DEVELOP A WARM RECEPTIVITY TOWARDS YOURSELF AND OTHERS... AND ONE DAY WE REALIZE THAT BEING RECEPTIVE IS NOT JUST "LISTENING" OR BEING "PASSIVE" IT IS ALSO AN ENERGY THAT PROVIDES A PROFOUND SUPPORT FOR THE PEOPLE WE LISTEN TO... BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THEM DEEPLY WITH LOVE... I don't know about the meaning of $500,000 in my dream. This number also has no meaning for me in life. Please help me decode this number THE NUMBER 5 IS ASSOCIATED WITH ANGEL MAHASIAH, WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RECTIFICATION OF ERROR. SINCE YOU ALSO SEE THE $ SIGN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS, SOMEWHERE YOU HAVE CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES TO RECTIFY SOME MATERIALISTIC INTENTIONS... . UP ABOVE INVITES YOU TO CHECK YOUR INTENTIONS BEFORE MATERIALIZING YOUR THOUGHTS OR YOUR PROJECTS... BUT IT SHOWS ALSO THE NEEDS THAT CAN BE STRONG BECAUSE IT IS QUITE A BIG AMOUNT... AND THE 0 IS RELATED TO MATTER, THE MORE THEY ARE 0, THE MORE IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT NOT MULTIPLYING THE WRONG INTENTION... YOU SEE IN THE ESSENCE OF THE DREAM THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO HELP WHICH IS A BEAUTIFUL QUALITY BUT BEHIND, SOMETIMES YOU HELP BECAUSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE LOVE AND TO BE APPRECIATED... AND THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR WITH THE TOWEL THAT BRINGS A QUALITY OF WARMTH, SOFTNESS, TO DRY THE OVERFLOW OF EMOTION... I also have another question. I usually work with Angels every 2 weeks. By the third week, it was quite difficult for me to concentrate to continue working with this Angel, so I often switched to another Angel. However, when I focus on transforming a distortion with an Angel, 23/07/2025, 11:13 Drying damp cloth towels | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/85633 2/3 2 weeks is not enough time, what if I change to another Angel and still focus on transforming that one distortion. Will it affect my transformation energy, or should I switch to another distortion when working with another Angel? HERE YOU CAN MAKE A PARALLEL WITH YOUR DREAM WHERE YOU SAID THAT TAKING CARE OF THE TOWEL, TO FOLD THEM UP CAN BE VERY TIRING... SO YOU SEE THAT SOMETIMES, IN YOUR INTENTION, YOU CAN BE SOMETIMES TOO FOCUSED ON THE RESULT... AND IT CREATES THE NOTION OF BEING TIRED AND NOT BE ABLE TO CONCENTRATE YOUR INTENTION IN THE CLEANSING PROCESS... IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU CAN INVOKE THE ANGELS WITH THE INTENTION TO DEVELOP YOUR QUALITIES WHILE YOU ARE ENJOYING THE TRANSFORMATIONAL PROCESS... IMAGINE THAT EACH TIME YOU ARE INVOKING AN ANGEL, YOU BECOME THE QUALITY... ON THE OTHER HAND....YES, YOU CAN KEEP ON WORKING ON A SINGLE DISTORTION AND CAN SWITCH THE ANGELS.....ALL THE ANGELS ARE INTER-CONNECTED.....ITS'S LIKE THESE ARE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS OF THE HEADQUARTER/GOD AND THEY ARE ALSO CONNECTED TO THE CENTER (GOD, THE UNIVERSE, THE COSMIC INTELLIGENCE WHATEVER THE NAME WE GIVE...)... SO YOU CAN WORK WITH ANY ANGEL FOR ANY DISTORTION TOO.....EVENTUALLY YOU WOULD BE LEAD IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ONLY... BECAUSE YOUR INTENTION WILL BE FOCUSED ON BECOMING A BETTER PERSON AND IMPROVING YOURSELF EVERY DAY... AND YOU CAN REMEMBER THAT YOU JUST NEED TO DO YOUR BEST AND THE UNIVERSE WILL TAKE CARE OF THE REST... THAT IS HOW WE CAN BE DETACHED FROM THE RESULT... Thank you, teachers. ANGELIC DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR INNER LOVE WHILE YOU HAVE THE JOY IN YOUR HEART TO MAKE EFFORTS WITH DETACHMENT WITH ANGELS CAHETEL & HAZIEL ÂN

I told this story to my two sisters. And the sisters said, don't say anything to your mother, just let it be and just receive it. The next day, I continued to spread the towel out to dry. The second sister asked me if I needed any help, I said I could do it. And in the dream, I remember the appearance of the number $500,000. This dream shows that I am gradually improving my receptivity. I am more open, more listening, understanding more of my difficulties and attachments to previous material needs. Now I am trying to learn to increase understanding, transform distortions and gradually change difficulties and consequences. The dream also shows my ability to self-study and self-transform, I can do it. The dream is a confirmation of the right path, the right knowledge, and the right way of doing things, encouraging me to keep working towards transformation.",

title_pdf: 16 Dream - The trip is inspired from within. last case id: C0190. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 3 September 2021 Angel: 29 Reiyel Dream mood: longing to discover, curious, surprised, not care Dream and Analysis: Hi teachers, ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU, This week I chant Reiyel Angel with the continuous intention: please help me expand my reception. A BEAUTIFUL INTENTION I am a high school student and I am in my old elementary school. THIS SHOWS HOW YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH YOUR INNER TEENAGER ENERGY...A TEENAGER DOES NOT HAVE MUCH EXPERIENCE BUT IS WILLING TO EXPERIMENT, LEARN AND MOVE FORWARD TO EXPLORE BUT IN ITS MINUS, A TEENAGER CAN BE REBELLIOUS, IMPATIENT, ARROGANT, AND SELF-CENTERED...THE SCHOOL SHOWS YOUR APPRENTICESHIP AND WHAT YOU NEED TO LEARN :-)... YOU CAN ALSO MEDITATE ON WHAT YOU EXPERIENCED IN YOUR OLD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL... . This is a boarding school [- too theoretical, too strict, too disciplined, difficulties related to learning, lack of motivation to learn AND THE BOARDING SCHOOL IS ALSO THE NOTION THAT THE STRUCTURE OF LEARNING BECOMES YOUR INTIMACY ALSO... SO THIS DREAM WILL SHOW DEEP MEMORIES FROM YOUR PAST... ] One day, everyone in the class was allowed to go out, I asked my friends to go out to a beautiful place to take pictures (It seems like I already know about that beautiful place, but I was afraid to go alone, so I invited everyone go together, and I also want to introduce them to the beautiful sights I know). HERE YOU ARE TRYING TO REACH A BEAUTIFUL STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN YOU THAT IS BEYOND MATERIALISM AND THE WORLD OF ACTION... IT SHOWS AN EFFORT TO BECOME MORE RECEPTIVE... SINCE THE INTENTION IS TO GO TO THE PLACE AND TAKE PICTURES IT'S LIKE INSTEAD OF ENJOYING THAT STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS YOU ARE KEENER TO CAPTURE THE PICTURE....SO YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONNECT WITH YOUR INNER BEAUTIFUL PLACE BUT THERE ARE SOME MEMORIES THAT PREVENT YOU FROM DOING SO... AND THESE ARE MEMORIES RELATED TO NOT WANTING TO BE ALONE... YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONNECT WITH THE SOCIAL LEVEL SINCE YOU CAN HAVE SOMETIMES CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES BUILDING YOUR INTIMACY IN ORDER TO BE COMFORTABLE AND FEEL COMPLETE WITH YOURSELF... THAT BEING SAID, GOING WITH FRIENDS IS BEAUTIFUL, BUT IT IS THE INTENTION INSIDE THAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE... WHETHER IT IS BY COMPENSATION OR OUT OF LOVE... Because I have difficulty moving forward in reality, studying, so I tend to want to go back to the past, live in the past. I want to change the past to change the present for better. YES... AND YOU CAN COMPLETE WITH COMMENTS ABOVE... THE FIRST PARAGRAPH INVITES YOU TO LEARN TO BUILD A BEAUTIFUL PLACE, STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS WITHIN YOURSELF... AND BEFORE EXPANDING YOUR RECEPTIVITY, IT IS IMPORTANT TO BUILD A STABLE AND SOLID INNER STRUCTURE... We walked out of the school, the road in front of the school seemed to fall between two banks of high ground [- difficulties to advancing, to achieve objectives, lack of motivation, enthusiasm, courage, laziness. Here is the road with the fall between two banks of high ground, I think it's about the imbalance on the advance way, loss of focus, disorientation, lack of action to materialization YES... IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD... IT IS ALSO THE NOTION OF NOT ABLE TO MANIFEST A GOOD EMISSIVITY (ADVANCING ON THE ROAD), BECAUSE YOU CAN BE TOO DOWN-TO-EARTH, TOO FOCUS ON YOUR OBJECTIVE TO SEE THE BEAUTIFUL PLACE... ] , the grass was unevenly spread. This is quite a dusty road, red soil form. I want to go to the other side, I think it will be faster to cross the street. THE DUSTY ROAD HERE SHOWS THE TOO DOWN-TO-EARTH MEMORIES RELATED TO THE ADVANCEMENT IN THE SOCIAL LEVEL....BEFORE REACHING THE STATE OF BEAUTIFUL RECEPTIVITY THESE MEMORIES ARE TO BE TRANSCENDED... BUT THERE IS A DYNAMIC TO BYPASS THE ROAD SO AS TO MOVE FASTER BECAUSE OF FOCUSING ON THE RESULT... There is a close friend [- express a part of my unconscious. This symbol here are some of the following scenes that I think are more positive, because this friend always accompanies me every place I want to explore, and reminds me when I get too caught up in a certain action ] who goes with me, everyone still goes this side, maybe because going through the middle of the road will be quite dirty and dusty. SO HERE IS THE NOTION OF DUALITY... SOMETIMES YOU WOULD LIKE TO GO IN A DIRECTION AND SOMETIMES YOU ARE GOING IN ANOTHER DIRECTION... I lack action to materialization work, imbalance on the advance way, so I seek the support from within, from unconscious, from up above to support me. I also want to do something different from what I have done in the past. AND IN THAT PART YOU SEE THAT THE INNER ROAD IS NOT CLEAR... SO SYMBOLICALLY SPEAKING, BEING TOO FOCUSED ON THE RESULT, BEING TOO DOWN-TO-EARTH CREATE DIFFICULTIES TO ADVANCE IN YOUR LIFE SUCH AS HAVING DUALITIES IN YOUR ADVANCEMENT, NOT KNOWING WHAT IS THE GOOD SOLUTION... YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU CAN BE DISPERSED AT TIMES... After we went through some kind of difficult terrain together, we came to a place with beautiful scenery, trees, rocks, grasses [- temptation, illusion, erroneous perception, too focused on appearance, outer; too peaceful; superficial AND YOU SEE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONNECT TO YOUR INNER NATURE... YOU CAN ANALYZE THE SYMBOLIC MEANING OF THE TREES, THE ROCKS AND GRASSES TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR SOUL WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP... ] . Everyone was quite excited, taking pictures from the corners. Several people thanked me for discovering this interesting place. Then everyone gathered and asked me to take pictures. I took 2 photos, on the 3rd photo [- tendency to live in memories, to retain and preserve futilities, a desire to capture atmospheres and ambiances to fulfill a void and inner lacks, fear of lacking something, indiscretion. The 3rd link to Angel 3 Sitael about Construction SO YOU ARE SHOWN A DIFFICULTY TO BUILD THE PEACEFUL NATURE IN YOU..., Destruction, collapse of structures, unfavorable period, ruin, Greed, excess. I think 3rd photo is about too much focus on memories, finding lost things, building on the past and forgetting about the present, which leads to not forming consciousness, not enjoying the present moment well. ] , I said I don't take anymore, I want to go to the other side. Everyone seems a bit surprised and disappointed, maybe because I'm turning down a fairly simple help right now, and something's keeping me from waiting. AND HERE IS THE NOTION THAT AT THE SOCIAL LEVEL, YOU CAN BECOME MORE SELFISH THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE... REMEMBER, YOU WANT TO GO TO THIS BEAUTIFUL INNER PLACE, BUT DID NOT WANT TO GO ALONE... BUT ONCE YOU ARE IN THIS BEAUTIFUL PLACE, YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT OTHERS... SO IT MEANS THAT SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE TOO FOCUSED ON YOUR OWN NEEDS... I had the potential for change and ade the right initiate moves, but I left it halfway, letting another part of me down.... YES.... AND YOU CAN COMPLETE WITH COMMENTS ABOVE... AND REMEMBER THAT THIS DREAM IS A PERCENTAGE OF YOU :-) My best friend also followed me. In front of me, there was a large, green lawn. It was in the forest, there was a wooden house with an open door, the front and back doors were connected [- insecurities, show off, materialization, unstructured, loss of organization, lack of privacy in intimate life, too open, YES... AND YOU SEE THE NOTION OF THE FOREST, IN THIS CASE, IS THE NOTION OF WANTING TO BE ALONE LIKE AN HERMIT, TO BUILD YOUR INNER STRUCTURE OUTSIDE OF THE CITY (WOODEN HOUSE)... SO YOU ARE SHOWN A PATTERN WHERE YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE ALONE BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU DON'T WANT... THE FOREST IS ALSO RELATED TO UNCONSCIOUS INSTINCTUAL AND EMOTIONAL NEEDS... (ANIMALS + VEGETABLE)... ] so I could see behind the house there were many the trees are quite beautiful, majestic, a bit dark. The 2 of us walked and took pictures of the front and inside of the house. I went to the back to take goes back and forth around the same place - 23/07/2025, 11:14 The trip is inspired from within | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/85969 2/3 pictures. SINCE IT'S DARK HERE, SO YOU ARE NOW EXPLORING THE MEMORIES WHICH WERE IN THE UNCONSCIOUS BUT NOW YOU ARE READY TO VISIT AND UNDERSAND THESE MEMORIES... Although I know I lack the effort to materialize works, as well as I am too focused on the material, I am aware of those distortions but I still want to escape by living in the memories. In addition to the trees, I saw a white harmless shadow [- unreal, illusory, anxiety, fear, panic, karmas HERE THE WHITE MEANS THAT YOU ARE SHOWN SPIRITUAL MEMORIES, AND WHEN WE SAY SPIRITUAL MEMORIES IT MEANS DEEP MEMORIES THAT TOUCH THE CORE OF WHO YOU ARE... AND THE GHOST IS THE NOTION OF HAVING CERTAIN MEMORIES IN THE METAPHYSICAL LEVEL THAT IS NOT YET MANIFESTED IN THE CONCRETE LEVEL... ] , probably a ghost. This shadow goes back and forth around the same place [- repetition, too secure, too stable, difficult to change, YES... WELL UNDERSTOOD... YOU SEE THAT YOU CAN HAVE CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES CLEANSING MEMORIES THAT YOU VISIT IN THE DREAM... ] , I am not afraid of it and I feel it harmless. I wonder about it. IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL TO SEE THAT YOU ARE NOT AFRAID OF THE SHADOW. THIS SHOWS THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE KNOWLEDGE AND DIVINE LAWS TO A DEEPER LEVEL NOW.....YOU ARE NOT REJECTING YOUR INNER GHOST AND THE NEXT STEP IS TO TRANSFORM IT WITH LOVE :-)... It represents a percentage of me having difficulty learning, moving on, I'm stuck in place, while my distortions are still there, untransformed AND YOU RIGHTLY SAID, IT SHOWS THE REASON BEHIND THE RIGIDITY, LACK OF MOTIVATION AND DIFFICULTY TO CHANGE....BECAUSE IT'S STUCK IN THAT SPACE AND TIME..... My friend asked me what I was doing behind the scenes for so long, I said that the scene in the back was beautiful and then, the two of us went back to school. AND THIS DREAM IS HELPING TO DISCERN CERTAIN NEGATIVE MEMORIES THAT CAN PREVENT YOU FROM BEING RECEPTIVE... YOU SEE THROUGHOUT THE DREAM THAT YOU WERE MORE EMISSIVE THAN RECEPTIVE... YOU SEE THAT YOU CAN INFLUENCE THE DECISIONS OF OTHERS TO GO WITH YOU AND VISIT THE BEAUTIFUL PLACE AND THIS SHOWS A PROFOUND LEADERSHIP IN YOU THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO USE THE RIGHT WAY... AND THEN YOU WERE MORE THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF AND YOUR OBJECTIVE... AND RECEPTIVITY IS ALSO AN ENERGY THAT WELCOMES ALL IDEAS FROM EVERYONE AND TO CONNECT WITH OTHERS WITH RESPECT... IT IS BEAUTIFUL THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP THAT, DEAR NHU...YOU ARE READY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT YOURSELF, YOUR ENERGY IN THE SOCIAL AND COLLECTIVE LEVEL AND TO WORK ON THE DISTORTIONS PROGRESSIVELY WITH LOVE IN YOUR HEART... .... This dream is a reminder to me, because with the distortions that I've noticed in the past, I haven't started the deeper work to transform, there are the loops that happen. IT'S A PROFOUND DREAM NHU, YOU ARE RECEPTIVE ENOUGH TO RECEIVE THIS DREAM ...IT SHOWS YOUR JOURNEY AS TO HOW THE SPIRITUAL TRANSFORMATION UNFOLDS FOR YOU SO THAT YOU CAN BE MORE RECEPTIVE IN THE RELATIONAL LEVEL WHILE YOU ARE BUILDING A SOLID INNER STRUCTURE... THE DUSTY ROAD, DIFFICULT TERRAIN, PARTS OF YOU FOCUSED ON TAKING PICTURES...THESE ALL ARE THE CHALLENGES/MEMORIES WHICH NEED TO BE WORKED UPON BEFORE YOU REACH THE INNER GHOST AND TRANSCEND THE MEMOREIS RELATED TO FEELING OF BEING DEMOTIVATED, TIRED AND STUCK... AND YOU HAVE ALL THE KEYS TO TRANSFORM THAT... WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOUR QUALITIES... , ANGELIC CONTINUITY TOWARDS DIVINE RECEPTIVITY AND KNOWLEDGE WITH JELIEL AND REHAEL, ÂN

title_pdf: 17 Life - Low blood pressure (hypotension). last case id: C0191. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 10 September 2021 Angel: 9 Haziel Dream and Analysis: ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU, This week I can't remember dreams, but I found something that I've been wondering about for a long time, it's pretty amazing. NICE INITIATIVE TO DECODE THE LIFE Today, I received my second dose of the vaccine. During the examination, the nurse reminded me that I have low blood pressure (hypotension) [- blood represents vital energy and the world of vital emotions. Blood is red, the color of 1st Charkram which represents materialization, concrete action on the physical level. So when I have low low blood pressure or anemia, I think I lack motivation, lack of ability to actually take concrete action; difficulty becoming involved, manifesting YES RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD AND YOU CAN SEE THAT ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THE BLOOD IS TO PROVIDE NUTRIENTS AND OXYGEN TO ALL THE BODY... AND OXYGEN IS RELATED TO THE POSITIVE THOUGHTS THAT NOURISH POSITIVE EMOTIONS... YOU CAN EVEN ANALYZE THE VACCINE AS IF IT IS A DREAM... YOU ARE DISCOVERING YOURSELF BY UNDERSTANDING HOW TO PREVENT YOURSELF FROM BEING AFFECTED BY AN INNER AND OUTER VIRUS... E ] Actually, I've known I have had hypotension for a couple of years, however, I had never paid much attention to it. I went home and thoroughly researched this disease, I began to be surprised and happy to find out the main cause of my physical symptoms for so long. Especially about being cold inside, always feel an iceberg around my head And I think I need to analyze it carefully to see how symbolically I need to understand and should transform. LET'S DIVE INTO THIS DEEP UNDERSTANDING 1. Low blood pressure is a disease that causes blood vessels to constrict, reducing the volume and flow of circulating blood. Blood pressure readings below 90/60 mmHg. I thought I had a mild and prolonged illness, not a serious one. It's not really a disease of the type of rapid decline but physiological blood pressure. AND BEING CONSTRICTED SHOWS THE STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING TOO RIGID, TOO TENSE THAT CREATES THE OPPOSITE ASPECT OF BEING LAZY, NOT WANTING TO MANIFEST... 2. Causes: living in high mountains [- mountain represents action world, high mountain link about thoughts world too, it represents lack of vision, blur AND IT REPRESENTS ALSO A DISCONNECTION WITH THE WORLD OF MATTER IN THE NEGATIVE ASPECT... IT CAN SHOW THE TENDENCY TO FLEE MATTER BECAUSE OF CERTAIN NEGATIVE MEMORIES... MOUNTAINS ALSO IMPLY ESCAPING FROM MATTER , THE WORLD OF ACTION AND MANIFESTATION.....WE CAN ASSOCIATE MOUNTAINS TO A STATE OF INTERIORIZATION AND ELEVATION BY DEVELOPING A GLOBAL VISION TOO.... ] and long-term stress. These are the causes that I find myself suffering from and are likely to make my current anemia. AND IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTICE THAT WHEN PEOPLE INTERIORIZE, MOST OF THE TIME THEY SIT AND WHILE SITTING FOR A PROLONGED TIME, IT CAN LOWER DOWN THE PRESSURE OF THE BLOOD THAN NORMAL.... AND WHEN ONE SITS IN THE LOTUS POSITION FOR A LONG TIME, HE/SHE MAY FEEL A NUMBNESS IN THE LEGS....WHICH IS BECAUSE OF THE LESS BLOOD FLOW INTO THE LEGS, SO IT INHIBITS THE ADVANCEMENT INTO THE WORLD SO YOU SEE HERE TOO MUCH MEDITATION IS NOT GOOD, TOO INTENSE IN THE MATERIALIZATION IS NOT GOOD EITHER... AND YOU SEE THAT BEING LIMITED WITH ANEMIA SHOWS THAT IN PAST LIVES, YOU WERE USING YOUR VITAL ENERGY TOO INTENSELY... AND NOW YOU HAVE PROFOUND SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE SO THAT YOU CAN INCARNATE INTO THE WORLD OF ACTION WITH A BEAUTIFUL INTERIORIZED AND SACRED INTENTION FILLED WITH WISDOM, CARING, AND RIGHT MOTIVATION TO MOVE FORWARD ANGELICALLY... 3. Symptoms that I have - Feeling dizzy: when I go up and downstairs a lot, sit for a long time and suddenly change position. AND HERE IT MEANS A DIFFICULTY TO WELL BALANCED EMISSIVITY AND RECEPTIVITY... AND ALSO A DIFFICULTY TO REACTIVATE YOUR VITAL ENERGY WHILE YOU ARE IN A RECEPTIVE MODE... - Severe headache: The headache will get worse each time the brain is stressed or heavy physical activity. Each time there is a different degree of headache, sometimes more severe pain in the top of the head. Sometimes the pain is more severe, both painful and numb. DIZZINESS AND HEADACHE CAN ALSO BE ASSOCIATED WITH EXCESS OF THOUGHTS...TOO MUCH LIVING IN MIND... AND REMEMBER... PAIN IS A SIGNAL FROM THE BODY THAT THERE IS SOMETHING TO CHANGE WHETHER IN YOUR THOUGHT, EMOTIONS OR BEHAVIORS AND ONCE YOU CAN DECODE WITH THE SYMBOLIC LANGUAGE, YOU CAN PROGRESSIVELY TRANSFORM ANY NEGATIVITIES WITH LOVE AND PATIENCE... - Decreased concentration: when the body lowers blood pressure, the blood supply to the brain will not be as normal as usual, thereby causing brain cells not to receive enough oxygen and nutrients to function properly. This is the main reason that hinders the ability to concentrate in people with low blood pressure. YES... THAT IS WHY I SUGGEST YOU CONTINUE TO MEDITATE AND DO BREATHING EXERCISES TO BRING POSITIVE THOUGHTS WHILE TRANSFORMING NEGATIVITY... AND BREATHING EXERCISE CAN JUST TAKE FEW MINUTES PER DAY, IT WILL HELP YOU TO OXYGENATE THE WHOLE BODY BUT NOT JUST IN THE PHYSICAL LEVEL BUT ALSO IN YOUR INTENTION... - Blurred vision: People with severely low blood pressure will show signs of hearing loss, reduced vision, blurred vision. Sudden blurred vision can be dangerous if you're on the road. YES... AND IT IS A STRONG SIGNAL FOR YOU TO CHANGE SOMETHING IN THE WAY YOU PERCEIVE CERTAIN SITUATIONS... IT CAN BE GOOD IF YOU CAN ANALYZE WHEN THE BLURRED VISION OCCURS... BECAUSE IT WILL SHOWS WHAT TRIGGERS THE BLURRED VISION... IT SHOWS THAT SOMETIMES YOU DON'T WANT TO FACE CERTAIN ORDEALS, CERTAIN SITUATIONS... - Nausea: I have nausea in stages, episodes. There was a time when I even suffered from acid reflux. NAUSEA AND ACID REFLUX IS RELATED TO WEAK DIGESTION. DIGESTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ABILITY OR THE INABILITY TO DIGEST THE EXPERIENCES OF LIFE. SOMETIMES WHEN THE SOUL IS TOO TIRED WITH THE DIFFICULT EXPERIENCES OF LIFE (DUE TO THE DIFFICULTY TO UNDERSTAND AND DECODE LIFE) IT MAY ESCAPE INTO MOUNTAINS (EXCESSIVE DETACHMENT) FROM THE WORLD. BUT THE MEMORIES OF A DIFFICULTY TO DIGEST LIFE'S EXPERIENCES SHOW UP IN THE FORM OF DIGESTION ISSUES, ACID, NAUSEA, ETC... AND NAUSEA IS ALSO RELATED TO WANTING TO ELIMINATE WHAT CANNOT BE DIGESTED... - Cold, moist, or pale skin: When your blood pressure is low, your limbs often feel numb and cold inside. This is because your body is unable to maintain blood flow and oxygen delivery to the skin, causing hypothermia. This I find quite similar to the fact that I have a cold inside my body, in addition to being cold in my head, I am also cold in other parts, especially the joints of my legs and arms. WE CAN ASSOCIATE THE COLDNESS TO THE COLDNESS OF EMOTIONS ALSO... AND THE COLDNESS ACTS LIKE A PROTECTION SO AS NOT TO FEEL CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES AS WELL AS THE BLURRED VISION SO AS NOT TO SEE... - Fatigue: usually appears in the morning, I often feel mentally tired, my limbs are numb, tired, and have no vitality. In the afternoon or evening, the body appears tired again, although not just overworked. YES, THE LACK OF MOTIVATION FROM THE DEEP MEMORIES WITHIN CAN CAUSE FATIGUE... AND AT THE SAME TIME, IF YOU FEEL TIRED IT IS IMPORTANT TO SEE IF EVERYTHING IS OK REGARDING EATING HABITS... THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH NUTRIENTS, VITAMINS IN THE PHYSICAL LEVEL... - Depression: Patients with low blood pressure often have a sluggish, sad mood and are very prone to depression. AND DEPRESSION IS RELATED TO RELEASING THE PRESSURE YOU PUT ON YOURSELF... IT IS AN EMERGENCE OF A BIG BLOCK OF MEMORIES THAT WERE REPRESSED... WE ARE HAPPY THAT YOU MEET THIS SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE... IT WILL TRULY HELP YOU TO BUILD A BETTER LIFE... - Feeling thirsty: When blood pressure drops, the body will receive a signal from the brain to drink more water, adding more water will help increase blood pressure. I drink quite a lot of water and always feel thirsty. AND YOU SEE HOW THE SOUL AND THE BODY HAVE A MECHANISM OF PROTECTION AND COMPENSATION AT THE SAME TIME... THE LACK OF EMOTIONS WITHIN IS COMPENSATED WITH THE SIGNAL OF BEING THIRSTY SO THAT YOU CAN START TO DRINK IN THE OUTSIDE WHAT IS MISSING INSIDE... BUT HERE WE CAN EVEN TALK ABOUT A POSITIVE MECHANISM OF COMPENSATION... BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN KNOWS INSTINCTIVELY THAT YOU NEED TO DRINK TO INCREASE BLOOD PRESSURE, OTHERWISE HAVING LOW BLOOD PRESSURE CAN TRIGGER DIFFICULTIES AND PROBLEMS... WHEN WE THINK ABOUT IT, IT IS AMAZING HOW THE BODY ALWAYS WANTS TO FIND AN EQUILIBRIUM... After I learned about the symptoms and causes, I found it all connected with emotional (water), lack of emotion (anemia, feeling thirsty all the time), no emotion (cold inside). ), living in the highlands (blurred vision), depression. AND YOU CAN NUANCE ALSO... INSTEAD OF NO EMOTIONS, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE EMOTIONS BUT SOMETIMES YOU CAN REPRESS THEM WITHIN. IT'S LIKE CUTTING OFF FROM THE EMOTIONS BY RELYING MORE ON THE THOUGHT PROCESS, LOGIC ETC. AND THAT IS WHY AFTER YOU CAN HAVE HEADACHE BECAUSE YOU CAN BE TOO MUCH IN THE MIND AND NOT ENOUGH CONNECTED TO THE EMOTION... BECAUSE THE EMOTIONAL LEVEL CAN BE DIFFICULT TO VISIT AT TIMES... AND THE OBJECTIVE IS TO CONNECT THE THOUGHT AND EMOTIONAL LEVEL TO MATERIALIZE YOUR QUALITIES WITH LOVE AND WISDOM... AND THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING BY FOLLOWING YOUR DREAMS AND CLEANSING YOUR MEMORIES PROGRESSIVELY... AND IF YOU WISH, IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT THAT YOU CAN CHECK PHYSICALLY WITH A DOCTOR TO SEE IF EVERYTHING IS GOOD... HERE YOU HAVE A PROFOUND UNDERSTANDING IN TERMS OF SYMBOLIC LANGUAGE, WHICH IS AMAZING... BUT THE PHYSICAL LEVEL IS ALSO 23/07/2025, 11:14 Low blood pressure (hypotension) | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/86277 2/3 IMPORTANT TO INVESTIGATE TO SEE IF YOU CAN IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH WITH THE ADVICE OF A DOCTOR... GOOD EATING HABITS, DOING SPORTS, ETC. CAN REALLY IMPROVE HEALTH... YOU HAVE DONE A PROFOUND RESEARCH ON THE LOW BLOOD PRESSURE DEAR NHU... MAY THIS RESEARCH AND AWARENESS MAKES YOU MORE FOCUSSED AND INSPIRES YOU EACH DAY TO KEEP WORKING ON YOURSELF WITH LOVE AND WISDOM ANGELIC CONTINUITY TO REDISCOVER YOURSELF MORE PROFOUNDLY AND RECEIVE DIVINE HEALING WITH ANGEL HAHASIAH AND MELAHEL ÂN

title_pdf: 18 Dream - Hunting for Thieves. last case id: C0192. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 17 September 2021 Angel: 2 Jeliel Dream mood: Scare, mystery, afraid Dream and Analysis: Hi teachers, ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU This week I chant the Angel Jeliel with the question: Should I move in with my eldest sister? I went to my hometown .THE HOMETOWN IS RELATED TO THE ORIGIN. SINCE YOU WENT TO THE TEMPLE ITS SHOWS THE ORIGIN OF YOUR SPIRITUAL VALUES... I invite Thuong [+ she is my friend, is a hardworking, industrious, intelligent, very kind person, inside there are also quite rebellious YOU CAN PUT REBELLIOUS AS A NEGATIVE ASPECT, interesting thoughts ] [- too secure, too stable, not daring to step out of her comfort zone ] to hang out at a temple [- the temple represent the inner, showing the ancient knowledge, old memories; the minuses are living in the past, superstitious, avoiding reality, refusing to change, conservative YES RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD ] . And I met Quan. Quan went with Quan's 2nd-grade classmates. They walked very mysteriously, gently, without noise, following a neat line. They're not like hanging out. They go to temple to Ouija [- it is a spiritual act, so it shows that I am digging into my own unconscious memories; the minuses are superstition, blind belief, unrealistic YOU SEE PARTS OF YOU THAT WOULD LIKE TO CONNECT WITH THE METAPHYSICAL WORLD... YOU WOULD LIKE TO DISCOVER CERTAIN MEMORIES IN YOU, DEEP DOWN IN YOUR INNER SPIRITUAL STRUCTURE (TEMPLE) ] . They wish to see an old friend who committed suicide [- despair, suffering caused by an accumulation of negative memories, lack of communication, false belief, lack of love, lack of global vision YES... IT IS ALSO A REFUSAL TO FACE NEGATIVITY, THINKING THAT SUICIDE WILL STOP THE SUFFERING... BUT THE PAIN WILL REMAIN THE SAME IN THE PARALLEL WORLDS... ] . I don't know who committed suicide. HERE YOU ARE TRYING TO CONNECT TO THOSE PARTS OF YOU WHO HAVE A DIFFICULTY TO UNDERSTAND LIFE AND THE LIFE PROGRAM. SUICIDE IS COMMITTED IN THE STATE OF MIND WHERE ONE IS NOT ABLE TO ACCEPT LIFE, IT HAPPENS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE REASON BEHIND THE ORDEALS AND ONE GOES INTO THE VICTIM CONSCIOUSNESS. YOU KNOW THAT LACK OF MOTIVATION CAN ALSO OCCUR BECAUSE OF DIFFICULTY TO ACCEPT AND LEARN FROM THE ORDEALS OF LIFE....THE ORDEALS ARE THERE SO THAT WE CAN DEVELOP QUALITIES IN US, BUT WHEN ONE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND IT HE/SHE CAN HAVE A LOT OF ANGER AND WHICH CAN LEAD TO SELF-SABOTAGE... I had difficulty getting back inside because I had distortions that I resonated with family members. I have a harsh attitude, lack of communication with a part of me, lack of love, a tendency to live in the past when it comes to family-related memories.YES, RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD AND YOU ARE SHOWN CERTAIN PATTERNS WHERE YOU HAVE REPRESSED MEMORIES... AND WITH YOUR QUESTION ABOVE, YOU ARE GOING INTO THE ROOT CAUSES OF CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES... I and Thuong went to the temple to visit. When I went to the bathroom, I opened the door and accidentally met a woman, this woman pressed her hand to my chest [- too open, permissive, superficial YES... YOU ARE SHOWN WHAT KIND OF MEMORIES YOU HAVE REPRESSED PROFOUNDLY (SUICIDE)... IT IS MEMORIES RELATED TO LACK OF LOVE, WANTING TO CREATE INTIMACY WITH OTHERS BUT WITH A PERCENTAGE OF FORCING OTHERS TOO MUCH... ] . I just realized I forgot to wear a bra. Then on reflex, I covered it with my hand. HERE YOU ARE SHOWN THE MEMORIES OF BEING TOO INTRUSIVE INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S LIFE AND INTIMACY AS THE WOMAN PRESSED HER HAND ON YOUR CHEST, SHE COULD HAVE JUST TOLD YOU VERBALLY IF SOMETHING WAS WRONG. SINCE YOU WENT TO THE BATHROOM, THE UNIVERSE IS SHOWING THE NEED TO CLEANSE THESE MEMORIES... After that, Thuong found that the old friend who had committed suicide was Nhan. The reason is love. He confessed and she didn't agree. He took a gun [- abuse of power and authority; thirst for violence or revenge; destructive emissivity, complex of superiority and inferiority ] and committed suicide on the spot. The old friends want to ouija to see and talk to Nhan. THESE MEMORIES SHOW THE EXTREME REPRESSION TOWARDS ONESELF IF THINGS DO NOT HAPPEN THE WAY YOU WISH THEM TO HAPPEN. IT REFLECTS A % OF TENDENCY IN WHICH IT CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO DEAL WITH REJECTION AND ALSO A LACK OF LOVE WITHIN WHICH LEADS TO EXTREME ANGER AND AGGRESSION TOWARDS YOURSELF AND OTHERS... I tend to be violent on the inside when I think about my family, and at the same time, I have a superficial attitude to the contradictions that I cannot answer within myself. AND THIS DREAM IS HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHY YOU HAVE ATTRACTED DIFFICULT SITUATIONS IN THE PAST, SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WITH THE SYMBOLIC LANGUAGE HOW VIOLENCE, AGGRESSIVITY, ANGER, DON'T CREATE HARMONY... YOU ARE BLESSED TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS KNOWLEDGE... YOU CAN REPROGRAM EVERYTHING NOW... YOU DON'T NEED TO REPRESS ANYMORE After that, I & Thuong & my eldest sister [+ She is an intelligent person, a thorough thinker, understanding and reasonable, well organized ] [- She is short-tempered, imposing, manipulative, aggressive, likes to speak loudly, there was a time when I was afraid to look at her face to face ] went to our family's old house. AND THE OLD HOUSE IS THE NOTION OF VISITING OLD MEMORIES... YOU CAN EVEN ANALYZE WHAT THIS OLD HOUSE IS REPRESENTING FOR YOU... At this time, I found out that there were a series of cases of losing laptops [- Laptop represents work, entertainment, communication, storage, technology, agility, well-organized. The loss of laptop represents poor work organization; lack of motivation in work, motivation in arranging life; lack of the ability to store information and memories, loss of connection for a long time (series) LAPTOP IS THE ABILITY TO ORGANIZE, GET CONNECTED, EXPEDITE WORK SPEED, EASE OF DOING A LOT OF WORK IN LESS TIME AS COMPARED TO OLD DAYS. SO WHEN WITH YOUR INNER SISTER ENERGY AND INNER THUONG ENERGY AFFECT YOUR INTIMACY, YOU FIND IT DIFFICULT TO ORGANIZE, CONNECT WELL... AND IN A LARGER PERSPECTIVE, THE LAPTOP ALSO IS A BEAUTIFUL SYMBOL RELATED TO THE SOUL... BECAUSE OUR SOUL IS LIKE A LIVING COMPUTER WHERE WE HAVE POSITIVE, NEGATIVE DATA IN IT, WHERE WE STORE OUR DEEP MEMORIES AND THAT WE NEED TO CLEANSE AND UPDATE REGULARLY... SO YOU SEE THAT WHEN YOU REPRESS YOUR EMOTIONS, THE NEGATIVE MEMORIES (SUICIDE), YOU LOSE THE CAPACITY TO ACCESS TO YOUR SOUL AND YOUR GREAT POTENTIAL... ] in my hometown. Meanwhile, I also brought my laptop home. L At this time, in my old house, there were the housekeeper [- management is too strict, too rigid, too strict, too conservative AND YOU SEE THAT YOU HAVE PUT "STRICT" TWO TIMES... IT SHOWS THE RESONANCE YOU MAY HAVE WITH THIS STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT CAN AFFECT YOUR RELATIONAL LEVEL (2 TIMES)... ] and her grandson. I'm quite suspicious of the housekeeper, she looks suspicious and has something to hide. She is quite old, has an ugly appearance. I lack of motivating, lack of connecting with family members, so I lack connection with parts of me. AND THIS SCENE IS SHOWING YOU THAT REPRESSING YOUR MEMORIES CREATES ANOTHER DIFFICULTY WHERE YOU BECOME TOO STRICT, TOO RIGID... REMEMBER IN YOUR PREVIOUS DREAM WHERE YOU SAID THAT YOU HAVE DIFFICULTIES FEELING, THIS IS BECAUSE THERE ARE REPRESSED MEMORIES THAT YOU ARE VISITING NOW... BECAUSE YOU ARE READY TO ENTER DEEPER IN YOUR INNER COMPUTER, IN YOUR SOUL... WITH THE HOUSEKEEPER YOU CAN SEE WHAT YOU ARE PROGRAMMING IN YOU WHEN YOU REPRESS MEMORIES... YOU START TO HAVE DIFFICULTY TAKING CARE OF YOUR INNER STRUCTURE AND HAVE DIFFICULTY ALSO TAKING CARE OF YOUR POTENTIAL, YOUR FUTURE (GRANDSON)... When I entered the house, I took off my jewelry, bracelets and wallets [- too focused on appearance, excessive beauty, too generous, like to show off ] , and left them on the sofa. I talked to everyone that I brought my laptop home, and everyone was worried. By this time, the housekeeper was gone, and her grandson remained. Her niece is about to ask permission to go home. I suspect the housekeeper is the thief [- shortage of material and spiritual, too focused on material things, lack of love, lack of tolerance ] who caused the series of theft laptop cases. So I arrested her grandson, searched immediately. And I found mine and a friend's belongings hidden inside her clothes, including bracelets, jewelry, money. NOW GRADUALLY WITH THE PROFOUND WORK ON YOURSELF, YOU ARE ABLE TO KNOW AND STOP TO A CERTAIN EXTENT YOUR INNER HOUSEKEEPER'S GRANDSON. I.E THE TENDENCY TO DRAIN THE ENERGY OF OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS WITH SUBTLE MANIPULATION. AND YOU SEE THAT THE PROBLEMS RELATED TO LOVE (SUICIDE) CREATE A SERIES OF CONSEQUENCES IN YOUR INTIMATE STRUCTURE... SINCE LOVE CAN BE EQUAL TO BEING HURT, YOU ARE FOCUSSING YOUR INTENTION ON MATERIALISTIC NEEDS... (JEWELRY, BRACELETS, WALLETS, COMPUTER) AND A PART OF YOU IS READY TO STEAL OTHERS TO OBTAIN WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO POSSESS... THAT IS WHY YOU COULD HAVE BEEN ALSO TOO FOCUSED ON HAVING MONEY AS YOU HAVE EXPLAINED IN PREVIOUS DREAMS, SHARINGS... At that time, I & Thuong & my eldest sister, 3 people with 3 motorbikes [- moving forward in life independently, 3 represents construction ] , my eldest sister also carried Bin. The 3 of us go home to protect my laptop. As soon as I came out of the gate, I met my father [+ calm, thoughtful, persuasive talk, good at communication, self-sacrificing, SACRIFICING CAN BE A BEAUTIFUL QUALITY THAT 23/07/2025, 11:15 Hunting for Thieves | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/86693 2/3 REPRESENTS DEVOTION... BUT IN THE NEGATIVE ASPECT, IT SHOWS ALSO THE NEED TO BE LOVED, APPRECIATED BY OTHERS... AND YOUR FATHER REPRESENTS THE ORIGIN OF YOUR MASCULINE POLARITY ] [- patriarchal, enduring, lack of expression ] who was carrying a friend back to our old house to play, including the housekeeper. I told him I needed to go home to protect my laptop, so my dad turned around and everyone went home together. SO NOW AS YOU ARE AWARE OF YOUR INNER HOUSEKEEPER ENERGY AND AS YOU ADVANCE ON THE PATH OF CLEANSING YOUR MEMORIES AND AS GET BACK YOUR MOTIVATION AND ABILITY TO CONNECT WELL, YOUR ACTIONS (FATHER) ARE SUPPORTING YOU. BUT HERE, YOUR INNER HOUSEKEEPER SHOULD HAVE FACED THE CONSEQUENCES OF STEALING... YOU SEE THAT YOU CAN LET NEGATIVITY HAPPENS EVEN IF YOU ARE PROTECTING YOUR LAPTOP... YOU SEE THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO STOP A NEGATIVE BEHAVIOR BUT THE ROOT CAUSES ARE STILL WAITING TO BE TRANSFORMED AND REPROGRAMMED The dream shows that I am too focused on substance, I am too difficult with a part of me, not loving enough, lack internal structure building. I need to transform this old structure. Tendency to be harsh on yourself. AND YOU CAN COMPLETE WITH THE COMMENTS ABOVE, DEAR NHU... THE DREAM SHOWS THE MEMORIES WHICH NEED TO BE WORKED UPON IF YOU WISH TO LIVE IN HARMONY AND PEACE WITH YOUR SISTER OR YOUR FAMILY. THE MEMORIES OF EXCESSIVE INTRUSION INTO LIVES OF OTHERS, MEMORIES OF EXTREME ANGER AND AGGRESSION WHICH COULD LEAD TO SELF-SABOTAGE, MEMORIES RELATED TO STEALING AWAY THE ENERGY OF FAMILY MEMBERS BY SUBTLE MANIPULATIONS....SUCH MEMORIES NEEDS TO BE CLEANSED AND WORKED UPON.....THE VALUES AND BELIEFS WHICH FORCE, IMPOSE THE RULES ON OTHERS, NEEDS TO BE CLEANSED... REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE YOUR SISTER, THE HOUSEKEEPER, THE GRANDSON, AND EVERYONE ELSE IN THE DREAM... LOOK INTO THE MINUSES OF EACH ONE OF THEM AND BE AWARE TO APPLY THE LAW OF RESONANCE.....THE MORE YOU ARE ABLE TO WORK ON THESE MINUSES DEAR NHU, THE MORE WHO WILL FEEL EASE AND HARMONY WHEN YOU ARE WITH YOUR SISTER OR WITH YOUR FAMILY... SO THIS DREAM IS NOT SAYING WHETHER YES OR NO YOU SHOULD LIVE WITH YOUR ELDEST SISTER, IT RATHER SHOWS THE MEMORIES THAT ARE EMERGING IN YOU WHEN YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT MOVING WITH HER... YOU SEE VERY OLD MEMORIES FROM PAST LIVES THAT ARE EMERGING REGARDING DIFFICULTY WITH LOVE, REPRESSION OF EMOTIONS, DIFFICULTY TAKING CARE OF YOUR INNER STRUCTURE... YOU RECEIVE A PROFOUND DREAM... WE ARE HAPPY THAT YOU CAN SEE THOSE MEMORIES BECAUSE ONCE YOU CAN IDENTIFY THOSE PATTERNS IN YOU, YOU CAN TRANSFORM THEM AND CREATE A LIFE WHERE LOVE BECOMES EASIER, DEEPER, NOT COMPLICATED... ANGELIC TRANSCENDENCE OF THE FAMILY MEMORIES FOR RECONCILIATION AND HARMONIOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH ANGEL CHAVAKHIAH ÂN

They walked very mysteriously, gently, without noise, following a neat line. They're not like hanging out. They go to temple to Ouija. They wish to see an old friend who committed suicide. I don't know who committed suicide. I had difficulty getting back inside because I had distortions that I resonated with family members. I have a harsh attitude, lack of communication with a part of me, lack of love, a tendency to live in the past when it comes to family-related memories. I and Thuong went to the temple to visit. When I went to the bathroom, I opened the door and accidentally met a woman, this woman pressed her hand to my chest. I just realized I forgot to wear a bra. Then on reflex, I covered it with my hand. After that, Thuong found that the old friend who had committed suicide was Nhan. The reason is love. He confessed and she didn't agree. He took a gun and committed suicide on the spot. The old friends want to ouija to see and talk to Nhan.

title_pdf: 19 Dream - Drowning in emotions. last case id: C0193. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 24 September 2021 Angel: 2 Jeliel Dream and Analysis: Hi teachers, ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU, This week, I still chant Angel Jeliel with the question: Should I move in with my eldest sister? Should I move to a new place? And I can't remember dreams this week, so I decided to decode an old dream. This dream is a bit special for me. Because it is a dream that gave me strong emotions about family: surprise, doubt, etc... and I asked myself about this dream a lot. The dream came to me before I start to learn DSSI course. And this is the dream that I really want to ask Professor Christiane when I met her on Retreat course in Dalat last 2 years. However, somehow, I can't have a chance to talk to her to ask about this. So, now, I think I can try to decode the dream by myself YES, IT'S A GOOD PRACTICE AND INITIATIVE I drove my mother [+ represent my feminine polarity. Mom is very generous, loving, helpful, enthusiastic, well organized ] [- Mother is a loud talker, hot-tempered, tends to impose, less listen, resigned, refuses to share, embraces many things ] on a motorbike in front, followed by my eldest sister [+ She is an intelligent person, a thorough thinker, understanding and reasonable, well organized ] [- She is short-tempered, imposing, manipulative, aggressive, likes to speak loudly, there was a time when I was afraid to look at her face to face ] I drove my mother to a road surrounded by rice plants [- The rice plant is a plant. When it is ripe, it can be harvested to create food - rice grains, the rice plant represents emotions, rice grains represent a form of physical energy. The rice plant here can be understood as emotions associated with material energy. The road represents advance on the social level. The image of rice plants around the road can be understood as moving forward in my society with a materialistic purpose, having too many needs, while I don't have a proper understanding of material energy, to be able to have the right recipient at the social level WONDERFULLY ANALYZED... AND THE RICE IS ALSO A NOTION THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ABUNDANCE BUT IT CAN BE DRIVEN BY INSECURITIES... ] , with a rather large ditch [- represents emotions being confined to a narrow range, being confined to someone else's prescription, emotional dependence, emotional blockage, not being able to circulate AND THE DITCH REPRESENTS A PART OF YOU WHERE YOU CAN BE TOO DOWN-TO-EARTH WHEN YOU ENTER IN RESONANCES WITH WHAT YOUR INNER MOTHER AND INNER ELDEST SISTER REPRESENT FOR YOU... WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING FOR NOURISHING YOUR NEEDS (RICE), YOU CAN BE ALSO OVER-EMISSIVE, TOO MASCULINE... AT TIMES... AND IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... ] . I have less-listening, short-tempered, impatient personalities, manipulated others and tendencies that make it difficult for me to move forward in society. I have material goals in progressing in the social level and thereby creating emotional blockages THE DREAM HERE SHOWS THAT WHEN YOU MOVE FORWARD YOU CAN DEVELOP THE SAME ENERGY AS YOUR INNER MOTHER AND INNER ELDEST SISTER...EITHER YOU CAN SOMETIME IMPOSE YOUR POINT OF VIEW OR YOU CAN ATTRACT SOMEONE WHO HAS A DOMINANT BEHAVIOR BECAUSE OF THE MEMORIES INSIDE THAT CREATE RESONANCES... The UPS mail truck (my former company) [- truck represents progress in life on a collective level. Mails represent communication and information transmission. The mail truck represents communication on a collective level to move forward in society. Its minus point is that it cannot communicate, loses connection, transmits incorrect information. It is my former company, so it represents I store old information, old memories, no update, it was kept accumulating more and more, unable to release WELL DEEPENED... YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN YOU WHEN YOU BECOME TOO DOWN-TO-EARTH, TOO MATERIALISTIC IN YOUR WAY OF ADVANCING IN LIFE... YOUR CAPACITY OF PROVIDING COLLECTIVE EXCHANGE CAN BE OVERWHELMED BY YOUR EMOTIONS... IT BECOMES DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO CREATE CONNECTION IN THE CONCRETE (MAILS, PACKAGES, ETC) AND WITH COLLECTIVE LEVEL... ] sank. My eldest sister followed, and she felt surprised. Someone in the truck was sinking [- flooded with emotions. There are too many emotions inside and it is impossible to understand them. Difficult to clean and purify ] and it looks like they couldn't get out. SO YOU SEE, THAT WHEN YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO FEEL EMOTIONALLY WELL, YOUR POTENTIAL TO ADVANCE IN SOCIETY ALSO GETS BLOCKED. . YOU FEEL STUCK THAT YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO ACHIEVE OR MOVE FORWARD IN THE ADVANCEMENT IN THE SOCIETY , THE DIFFICULTY ACTUALLY STARTED WITH THE DIFFICULT EMOTIONS INSIDE... I store too many old memories, negative memories make it difficult to communicate on a social level, difficult to understand emotional blockages. And these negative emotions and memories kept accumulating until a point made me consciously recognize it... The three of us stood on the shore worriedly. My sister called my father [+ calm, thoughtful, persuasive talk, good at communication, self-sacrificing ] [- patriarchal, enduring, lack of expression ] she asked: is that so? (This sentence made me surprise and did not understand anything) She asked again: If dad was down there, mom would let him die too? At this point, I like suddenly awakened. THE DIFFICULTY TO MOVE FORWARD MAKES YOU QUESTION YOURSELF. REMEMBER, DEAR NHU, THE FATHER IS YOU AND THE MOTHER IS YOU TOO, THEY REPRESENT THE ORIGIN OF YOUR MASCULINE AND FEMININE POLARITIES. SO YOU CAN SEE A LACK OF SUPPORT WHEN YOU FEEL OVERWHELMED BY YOUR EMOTIONS, INSTINCTUAL NEEDS, AGGRESSIVITY (INNER ELDEST SISTER)... AND WHEN YOU FEEL OVERWHELMED BY EMOTIONS, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO COMMUNICATE... S My feminine polarity has pressed and encroached on the masculine polarity too much. This making it difficult for me to emissive on the outside, I tend to be strong to protect my inner weakness HERE YOU CAN COMPLETE THE UNDERSTANDING WITH THE COMMENTS ABOVE... I thought: If there is a day when my father lies down there (under this water) and no one saves, it is because of my mother. Mom created karma [- harshness, lack of love, refuse to know Divine laws ] she saw someone's death but she did not save [- superficiality, neglect, disinterest, insensitivity, selfishness, lack of love, excessive self-love ] . If the same thing happened to Dad in the future, no one would save him. BUT HERE IT SHOWS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW OF KARMA... UP ABOVE ACTIVATES A KARMIC DEBT WHEN IT IS TIME FOR THE SOUL TO UNDERSTAND THE MEMORIES AT THE ORIGIN OF THE DIFFICULTY... YOU SEE THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND AT A CERTAIN LEVEL THE LAW OF KARMA THAT YOU SHOULD HELP IF THERE IS SOMEONE IN DIFFICULTY AND IF YOU HAVE THE GREENLIGHT FROM UP ABOVE BUT IF WE GO TO ANOTHER LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING YOU SEE THAT THERE IS NO COINCIDENCE THAT THIS INNER TRUCK DRIVER WAS DROWNING... EXPERIENCING AN ACCIDENT LIKE THIS SHOWS AN ACCUMULATION OF MEMORIES FROM PAST LIVES... THAT YOU ARE NOW ABLE TO ENCOUNTER AND TO UNDERSTAND SO AS TO REPROGRAM, RECODIFY NEGATIVE EMOTIONS FROM YOUR INNER FAMILY... IT IS SUCH AS BLESSING TO BE ABLE TO DECODE YOUR DREAM SO YOU CAN GO AT THE ROOT CAUSES OF CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES SO AS TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE ANGELICALLY... I realized the imbalance between my masculine and feminine polarities YES. THE MINUSES WHICH YOU SEE IN YOUR MOTHER ARE ACTUALLY A REFLECTION OF YOUR INNER WORLD IN SOME %. SO YOU ARE AFRAID THAT IF YOU DO NOT CHANGE AND TRANSCEND THESE MINUSES IN YOU, YOUR POTENTIAL TO MANIFEST, ACT AND SUPPORT YOURSELF IN THE OUTER WORLD MAY LOSE ENERGY....YOU ALSO NEED TO REMIND YOURSELF OF THE LAW OF RESONANCE NHU.....IT HELPS TO ACCEPT OTHERS AS WELL AS OURSELVES WITH LOVE... Then I saw Mom jump into the water [- Dig deep into the emotional and unconscious worlds. Minuses are giving up, ending, difficulty in purification AND HERE YOU SEE A DUALITY BETWEEN 2 PATTERNS... IN YOUR EMOTION (MOTHER), YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAVE, TO RECUPERATE THE POTENTIAL OF COLLECTIVE COMMUNICATION, EXCHANGE (UPS) AND IN YOUR ACTIONS, YOU CAN LET NEGATIVITY HAPPENS (FATHER THAT DOES NOT WANT TO SAVE) BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE AFFECTED BY OVERWHELMING EMOTIONS... ] to save them. Among the people submerged in the water, there was my middle school friend who was also in the car. She floats on the water, backstroke style and alive. She said she was fine and wanted to lie on the water like that comfortably. I find it a bit strange. AND THE TEENAGE FRIEND IS SHOWING THE TEENAGER ASPECT IN YOU, YOU SOMETIMES LIKE TO STAY IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE EMOTIONAL STATE SO AS TO AVOID TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MANIFESTATIONS IN LIFE, ALSO TO AVOID GOING WITHIN AND ACCEPT THE LAW OF RESONANCE. YOU SEE ALSO A NOTION WHERE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE DIFFICULTIES DETECTING THAT YOU ARE OVERWHELMED BY YOUR EMOTIONS... YOU CAN EVEN THINK THAT IT IS A NORMAL STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS... I started digging into the blockages in my emotional world, the distortions of my feminine polarities. And I have started to notice distortions, and have a positive change in emotions positively, more comfortable (girl lying on the water) HERE IT IS MORE NEGATIVE, DEAR NHU... YOU CAN 23/07/2025, 11:15 Drowning in emotions | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/87015 2/3 COMPLETE THE UNDERSTANDING WITH THE COMMENTS ABOVE... Mom was looking for the driver [- a tendency to let ourselves be led, guided by negative, malevolent, incompetent; hyperactivities, hurried, speedy, reckless driving, a tendency to give our decisional power to others ] to save. I don't remember whether she found him or saved him yet. After that, my mother went ashore. AND AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS NOT THE IDEAL THAT YOUR MOTHER WANTED TO HELP THIS WAY...YOUR INNER MOTHER COULD HAVE DROWNED HERSELF... IN SUCH A STATE INSTEAD OF ASKING FOR HELP FROM OTHERS, YOU TRY TO HELP YOURSELF ON YOUR OWN......IN THE DREAM WHEN YOUR MOTHER JUMPED INTO THE WATER, UNPREPARED, SHE COULD HAVE RATHER LOOKED FOR HELP, CALL FOR THE POLICE, FOR AN AMBULANCE SO THAT YOU CAN BE SURE TO HAVE A PROPER HELP... AND NOT PUT YOURSELF IN DANGER ....SO IT SHOWS A LACK OF GLOBAL VISION WHEN YOU ARE EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED... In the process of digging into my emotions, I realized many negatives, distortions that I have (driver) AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU CAN REMEMBER YOUR QUALITIES AT THE SAME TIME This dream shows me my imbalance between 2 polarities, my distortions on 2 polarities related my emotional world, and now I realize that. YES, A BEAUTIFUL UNDERSTANDING, AND YOU CAN COMPLETE WITH THE COMMENTS ABOVE... During the process of interpreting this dream, I remembered that I have OCD, that is: I wash my hands a lot. I remember in a seminar Professor Kaya gave a lecture on OCD. And I understood that I always wash my hands many times with water, which means that I have distortions, negative memories related to emotions, difficulties in the reception (hand). However, I wonder if my distortions are different from other OCDs, what does it mean? Or I can understand that for OCDs, that are different symptoms and causes are often the same.YES THERE CAN BE DIFFERENT BEHAVORIAL PATTERNS FOR PEOPLE WITH OCD... AND TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE OCD, THE ROOT CAUSES OF AN OCD, WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WITH THE SYMBOLIC LANGUAGE, THE GESTURE THAT THE PERSON IS DOING... FOR EXAMPLE, WASHING HANDS MEANS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLEANSE THE DIRT, THE NEGATIVE MEMORIES BUT TOO MUCH ON THE OUTSIDE... YOUR SOUL KNOWS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO WORK ON YOUR CAPACITY TO GIVE, TO RECEIVE, AND TO MANIFEST IN LIFE... BUT CERTAIN MEMORIES SUCH AS IMPOSING YOUR POINT OF VIEW, AGGRESSIVITY, COLDNESS, HARSHNESS, LACK OF COMMUNICATION, NEGATIVE EMOTIONS CAN MAKE YOUR EXCHANGE WITH OTHERS MORE DIFFICULT (UPS TRUCK DRIVER)... THE DREAM SHOWS IMPORTANT ASPECT OF YOU WHERE YOU CAN HAVE INSECURITIES, INSTINCTUAL NEEDS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SATISFY (RICE)... IT IS IMPORTANT TO FEEL WHERE IN YOUR LIFE YOU CAN BEHAVE LIKE YOUR INNER MOTHER OR INNER ELDEST SISTER SO AS TO UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU HAVE THE SAME ENERGY WHEN YOU ARE A DYNAMIC OF NOURISHING YOURSELF... THIS DREAM IS ALSO SHOWING THE LACK OF ENRGY, MOTIVATION, AND ENTHUSIASM SOMETIMES... AND THE REST OF THE DREAM IS SHOWING YOU THE CONSEQUENCES... THIS DREAM IS A BEAUTIFUL INVITATION FROM UP ABOVE SO AS TO KEEP WORKING ON YOUR INNER FAMILY SO AS TO ACTIVATE YOUR BEAUTIFUL POTENTIAL AND POSSIBLITY IN YOUR LIFE BY BEING ABLE TO EXCHANGE IN THE COLLECTIVE LEVEL... ANGELIC MASTERING OF YOUR EMOTIONS SO AS TO FIND BACK YOUR POTENTIAL OF COLLECTIVE ADVANCEMENT AND EXCHANGE WITH CHAVAKHIAH & DAMABIAH, ÂN

title_pdf: 20 Dream - Stilt houses made of wood. last case id: C0194. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 1 October 2021 Angel: 72 Mumiah Dream and Analysis: Hi teachers, ANGELIC HELLO NHU This week I chant Angel Mumiah with the intention: please help me expand my reception. This week, I just remember a few scenes in my dream. There are 3 stilt houses made of wood and tree trunks [- House represents intimacy. Wood represents construction, structure, materialization. Wood is also associated with emotions and feelings world because the wood is taken from the tree. The floor represents the world of action. Stilt houses have a higher floor than other houses to avoid danger, the minuses are separating the inner world too much, taking excessive precautions from danger, not letting the impact of the outside affect the inner. This protection is made up of excessive emotions (wood and trees), which can be understood as over-emissive WELL DEEPENED.... AND THE NUMBER 3 IS ALSO THE NOTION OF CONSTRUCTION, OF HOW YOU BUILD YOUR INNER STRUCTURE, YOUR INNER HOUSE... ] in the middle of the sea, a short distance from the shore. Behind are the forest and the beach. I think it's in front of an island [- loneliness, solitude, self-isolate by emotions (water) ] . The floor is raised high, in case the sea level rises. 3 houses are arranged in an L shape, I am in the middle one. THE BEGINNING OF THE DREAM SHOWS THE ANCIENT MEMORIES (OLD HOUSE) OF ESCAPING FROM THE DIFFICULT EMOTIONS BUT ALSO CONNECTING WITH THE EMOTIONAL LEVEL WITHOUT WANTING TO BE AFFECTED (STILT HOUSES)... THE FEELING OF BEING IN SUCH HOUSE GIVES AN EXPERIENCE OF BEING SAFE FROM YOUR INNER SEA (COLLECTIVE AND UNCONSCIOUS EMOTIONS) AND THE RESONANCES FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD....SINCE THERE ARE 3 HOUSES IT SHOWS THAT YOUR INNER HOUSE AND STRUCTURE NEED CERTAIN RE- STRUCTURATION... The number 3 here means construction, this paragraph can be understood as the construction of my inner structure, my intimacy is created by too many pent-up and difficult emotions (wood and stilt houses). And it was made to prevent the entry of external emotions (sea). YES RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD... AND AS SAID ABOVE, THE SEA IS ALSO RELATED TO YOUR COLLECTIVE AND UNCONSCIOUS EMOTIONS, A HUGE RESERVOIR OF EMOTIONS IN YOU, YOU SEE AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONNECT DEEPLY WITH YOUR EMOTIONS BUT THERE IS STILL CERTAIN RESISTANCE... BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE IN CONTACT WITH YOUR EMOTIONS, YOU CAN BE TOO INTERIORIZED, TOO RECEPTIVE (ISLAND) AND YOU CAN ALSO ANALYZE THE FOREST AND THE BEACH WHICH REPRESENTS THE UNCONSCIOUS NEEDS AND BOTH OF YOUR INSTINCTUAL AND EMOTIONAL NEEDS (FOREST HAVE BOTH VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL REIGNS)... AND THE BEACH IS ALSO THE NOTION OF CONNECTING WITH YOUR UNCONSCIOUS ACTIONS FROM THE PAST, WANTING TO MEDITATE DEEPLY ON YOURSELF... Inside the stilt house is decorated like an old house. There is a lot of stuff such as stoves, cooking pots, chairs... Most of the furniture in the house is made of wood. IT SHOWS THE DIFFICULTY TO LET GO OF THE OLD VALUES, BELIEFS WITH WHICH ONE NOURISHES ONESELF... BUT ALSO THE REFINEMENT THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP IN YOUR INTIMACY SINCE WOOD IS ALSO A NOBLE AND ECO-FRIENDLY MATERIAL... There are 3 people: me, Andy [+ my current boss. He is a generous, gallant, respectful person to women and everyone around him, gentle, peaceful, listening, kind, strong, diligent in exploring and learning like a child ] [- He is also a stubborn person, leadership ability is not good ] and another man. This man makes me feel like a teacher [- difficult to transmit knowledge, lack of motivation, lack of confidence to share ] . This man makes me feel very gentle, sociable, good feeling, always guiding me, I need to learn a lot. I feel this man is here to teach me and I am not very familiar with this person. SINCE YOU ASKED UP ABOVE WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO IMPROVE YOUR RECEPTIVITY, HERE YOU GET THE GUIDANCE...IN YOUR INNER STRUCTURE, YOU ARE CONNECTING WITH YOUR INNER ANDY AND INNER TEACHER... SO YOU SEE THAT RECEPTIVITY IS NOT ONLY ABOUT LISTENING, OR BEING IN A STATE OF PASSIVITY, IT IS ALSO ABOUT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE A BEAUTIFUL EMISSIVITY SO AS TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION (INNER BOSS) AFTER DEVELOPING A BEAUTIFUL RECEPTIVITY... AND IT SHOWS THAT IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT THAT THE EMISSIVITY NEEDS TO BE DONE WITH WISDOM AND NOT BEING TOO FOCUSED ON YOUR OWN IDEAS (STUBBORN PERSON)... AND AS YOU WERE NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH YOUR INNER TEACHER, IT MEANS THAT YOU CAN HAVE CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES LEARNING HOW TO BALANCE BOTH YOUR EMISSIVITY AND RECEPTIVITY... My inner self (inside the house) created too much masculine energy (2 men), I was too focused on the emission. And I gradually got access to knowledge that made me understand my distortions and made me feel attuned to learning and growing (the feeling that a man gives me) YOU CAN COMPLETE THE UNDERSTANDING WITH THE COMMENTS ABOVE... In this atmosphere, I feel a bit uncomfortable and frustrated, but there is also a new, interesting, and curious feeling in it. And I don't remember what I do after that. This dream shows that I am gradually accepting knowledge and starting to touch the difficulties and distortions inside, recognizing them. And also show me the knowledge that I am approaching is the right direction. YOU SEE THE DUALITIES IN YOUR LEARNING PROCESS ABOUT BALANCING YOUR RECEPTIVITY AND EMISSIVITY... SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE BEING RECEPTIVE MEANS ALSO THAT YOU ARE CONNECTING TO YOUR COLLECTIVE AND UNCONSCIOUS EMOTIONS AND IT CAN MAKE YOU HYPERSENSITIVE REGARDING WHAT YOU FEEL, REGARDING YOUR RESONANCES, AND ALSO THE EMOTION OF OTHERS...BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU WOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE FROM YOUR COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS AND THIS IS VERY GOOD... THE DREAM IS ALSO SHOWING THE REASON WHY SOMETIMES YOU FEEL LONELY, LACK OF MOTIVATION...THE DREAM SHOWS THE INNER ANCIENT STRUCTURE WHICH NEEDS TO BE RESTRUCTURED...THE PLUSES OF YOUR INNER ANDY WILL HELP YOU BECOME MORE RECEPTIVE SO AS TO BE POSITIVELY EMISSIVE AND MAKE GOOD DECISIONS IN YOUR LIFE WITHOUT IMPOSING YOUR DECISIONS ON OTHERS... ....YOU CAN EVEN ASK IN YOUR MEDITATIONS TO IMBIBE THE PLUSES AND ALSO TO TRANSCEND THE MINUSES OF YOUR INNER ANDY.....SAME WAY YOU CAN WORK WITH THE INNER TEACHER...TRANSCENDING THE DIFFICULTY TO SHARE THE KNOWLEDGE, FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE OF THE UNIVERSE... ANGELIC CONNECTION WITH YOUR COLLECTIVE AND UNCONSCIOUS EMOTIONS SO AS TO LEARN THE EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN EMISSIVITY AND RECEPTIVITY WITH DAMABIAH & HAHAIAH ÂN

A NICE INITIATIVE I'm in elementary school THE SCHOOL HERE SHOWS HOW YOU LEARN IN THE SCHOOL OF LIFE, ALSO IT SHOWS THE MEMORIES OF HOW YOUR SOUL LEARNT WITH TIME , and everyone needs to go to school to do an event, so everyone needs to come very early around 4 AM. I and another friend arrived early and waited in the schoolyard [- Yard is the world of action. School is about knowledge, teaching. The schoolyard is about learning and teaching action. The minus is too theory, unrealistic, overthinking, difficult to learn, lack of motivation to learn IT IS ALSO THE PLACE WHERE CHILDREN CAN BE IN THE SOCIAL LEVEL, LEARNING HOW TO EXCHANGE WITH EACH OTHER, INTERACTING, PLAYING GAME TOGETHER, ETC. SO YOU SEE THAT YOU CAN HAVE DIFFICULTIES REGARDING THE LEARNING PROCESS OF HOW YOU INTERACT WITH MANY PARTS OF YOU... ] . I looked at the classrooms upstairs and was a bit scared because it was dark, it was not light at this time. We decided to wait in the schoolyard. SINCE THE CLASSROOM IS UPSTAIRS, IT SHOWS THE THOUGHT LEVEL. SO THERE IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED AT THE INTELLECTUAL LEVEL, WHICH SUBCONSCIOUSLY YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO EXPLORE. SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE AFRAID TO SEE THE MEMORIES OF PAST WAYS OF LEARNING (ELEMENTARY SCHOOL), AT THE MOMENT....BUT LATER ON, YOU EXPLORE WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN SCARED TO SEE AS YOU VISIT THE CLASSROOM... I'm visiting old memories RELATED TO LEARNING (elementary school). The number 4 represents the building of the structure, the angel number 4 is ELEMIAH representing divine power. There are two people here as a couple. ALSO A PARTNERSHIP OF ANY KIND...IT CAN BE A ONE-TO-ONE RELATIONSHIP WITH ANYONE... AND NOT NECESSARILY BEING IN A COUPLE...YOU CAN ALSO LOOK INTO THE MINUSES OF THIS INNER FRIEND WHO WAS WITH YOU SO AS TO UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS THAT CREATE RESISTANCE TO EXPLORE THE MEMORIES DEEPER. I have made an effort to understand the old memories, structures but have not reached the deeper level. I am afraid and lack of motivation to go into the deeper layers of memories in the unconscious (classrooms upstairs in the dark). YES VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD, IT SHOWS IN A DEEPER LAYER, THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO TRANSCEND THE LACK OF LOVE (YOUR QUESTION) BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU HAVE CERTAIN RESISTANCE, AND DIFFICULTIES TO SEE THE MEMORIES AT THE ORIGIN OF THIS LACK OF LOVE... After a while, about 4:30 AM, we went upstairs, we saw a group of friends was already there. I met an old friend here who is the host of the event. My friend joked with me that if I come early, I should go to class, not in the yard because it's not safe there (the friend joke with me because the friend knows I'm afraid of ghosts). YOUR FEAR OF GHOSTS IS DUE TO DIFFICULTY TO SEE YOUR MEMORIES THAT DWELLS IN THE METAPHYSICAL LEVEL AND THAT ARE NOT YET INCARNATED ON THE CONCRETE LEVEL... IT SHOWS CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES ACCEPTING THE LAW OF RESONANCE After that, more people came, we entered the class to learn Literature. AND YOU HAVE YOUR ANSWER ABOUT THE MEMORIES THAT UP ABOVE INVITES YOU TO TRANSFORM IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TRANSCEND THE LACK OF LOVE... YOU SEE THAT IN YOUR LEARNING PROCESS, YOU CAN HAVE CERTAIN DIFFICULTY LEARNING HOW TO EXPRESS YOUR THOUGHTS, HOW TO COMMUNICATE YOUR POINT OF VIEW, IT SHOWS ALSO THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP A CERTAIN REFINEMENT IN THE WAY YOU COMMUNICATE YOUR IDEAS... BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU ARE SHOWN A CERTAIN INFERIORITY/SUPERIORITY COMPLEX (INNER FRIEND WHO IS JOKING) THAT PREVENTS YOU FROM LEARNING REFINED COMMUNICATION... YOU CAN EVENTUALLY ATTRACT PEOPLE THAT CAN DIMINISH YOUR POTENTIAL AND THUS AFFECTING THE SELF- COMPASSION YOU ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE... A part of me subconsciously shows that entering the old memories is not scary and difficult. There are always things that help me discover, learn to correct myself (Literature subject), encourage me to continue and be bolder. AND YOU CAN COMPLETE THE UNDERSTANDING WITH THE COMMENTS ABOVE... After the class ended, a friend stood up and said that everyone should have a gift [- represents for offered unconditionally. Minuses are difficult to sharing, incapacity to give and receive IT SHOWS THAT WHEN YOU ARE IN A LEARNING PROCESS, YOU WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE A REWARD... INSTEAD OF APPRECIATED THE PROCESS OF LEARNING... AT TIMES... ] , but because of a mistake, it was not possible to give gifts to everyone. So now everyone needs to draw lots [- represents for fortunate. People can have the characters of greed, seeking easy opportunities to glory, happy quickly YOU ARE SHOWN A COMPENSATION SINCE YOU WERE NOT ABLE TO REACH THE REWARD YOU WOULD LIKE TO OBTAIN... IT SHOWS A CERTAIN DIFFICULTY TO BE HAPPY TO LEARN SINCE YOUR INTENTION CAN BE TOO MUCH BASED ON RECEIVING A REWARD... ] and the gifts will be sent back later. AND AS SAID ABOVE, HERE IT SHOWS THE ATTITUDE TO BE TOO QUICK TO REWARD YOURSELF INSTEAD OF PATIENTLY WORKING ON YOURSELF......THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE LITERATURE I.E CAN BE A WONDERFUL GIFT BUT SOMEWHERE BECAUSE OF NOT BEING ABLE TO CONNECT WELL WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF LEARNING TO EXPRESS YOUR EMOTIONS, TO COMMUNICATE WELL (LITERATURE) YOU MAY SEEK SUPERFICIAL REWARDS SOMETIMES.....YOU CAN LOOK INTO THE MINUSES OF THIS FRIEND TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS DYNAMICS CAN SUBTLY PLAY OUT SOMETIMES... THAT BEING SAID, REMEMBER THAT IT IS A PERCENTAGE OF YOU... YOU CAN ALSO CONGRATULATE YOURSELF EACH TIME YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING GOOD, AND YOU WILL SEE THROUGH TIME THE SELF-RECOGNITION AND THE SELF-COMPASSION YOU WILL BUILD... I have a hard to share with the people around me, sharing about the things I love and even difficulties. Therefore, I tend to seek quick happiness outside. WELL UNDERSTOOD... I and my friend were drawn first. We went down in the end of class. There is a long stick with lots of numbers and letters glued on [- numbers and letters can be represented for signs, symbols need to be interpreted logically. Minuses are lack of logic, lack of inner tight structure, complex of inferiority and superiority. The stick is about strength, power, effort. IT IS ALSO ABOUT OVER-EMISSIVITY... Minuses of the long stick are abusive or unjust, wrong use of force, power and authority, memories of aggression and destructiON ] it. We need to place the finger on a certain letter and read the corresponding text. Right now, I think it was a gift. These words were accidentally held upside down by my friend, who picked and read them, but I don't quite understand, I still think this gift is a bit strange. THE LONG STICK SHOWS THE EMISSIVITY AND THE LOTS OF NUMBERS AND LETTERS ON IT SHOWS THE AMBIGUITY IN THE ACTIONS... IT IS LIKE SOMETIMES YOU WOULD LIKE TO COMMUNICATE BUT THE OVER-EMISSIVITY CAN CREATE A DIFFICULTY TO COMMUNICATE (LETTERS) AND TO STRUCTURE YOURSELF (NUMBER)... YOU CAN SEE THAT YOUR INTENTION CAN BE TOO FOCUSED ON THE COMPENSATION OF HAVING A REWARD... AT TIMES....SO THERE IS A PART OF YOU THAT CREATES CONFUSION AND LACK OF CLARITY IN THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS...INSTEAD OF BEING RECEPTIVE TO YOUR INNER WORLD AND THEN COMMUNICATING WITH PATIENCE, AND CARING... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... A part of me has come to realize the difficulty of lack of love (place the finger on a certain letter and read the corresponding text), however, I still have a certain difficulty understanding (I don't quite understand). YOU CAN COMPLETE THE UNDERSTANDING WITH THE COMMENTS ABOVE After that, we continued to go down at the end of class. There was a box with pieces of paper inside [- The box is the container. Boxes are usually made of paper. Paper represents the realization of ideas, materialization. Small pieces of paper represent the divide of ideas. Minus points are lack of action, too many ideas and thoughts, lack of ability to actualize, too focused on material things WELL ANALYZED... ] , which needs to be shaken up and drawn lots. At this time, I realized that this was really a gift, the long stick was not a gift. And my friend picks first, I pick later. BUT THEN YOU REALIZE THAT THE ACTUAL GIFT IS BECOMING RECEPTIVE AND LEARN FROM EACH EXPERIENCE OF LIFE...THE BOX SHOWS YOUR RECEPTIVITY TO HOLD NEW IDEAS, EXPLORE THE HAPPINESS INSIDE YOU.....AND WAIT FOR THE LIFE TO MOVE WITH ITS OWN PACE WHILE YOU ARE FOLLOWING THE FLOW AND THE GUIDANCE OF THE UNIVERSE...THE GIFT IS TO APPRECIATE YOUR LEARNING PROCESS, DEAR NHU... ...SO IT IS ASKING TO LEARN TO BE PATIENT AND HAVE FAITH THAT THE REWARDS OF THE KNOWLEDGE AND WORKING ON YOURSELF WILL COME... BUT WITH TIME, AS YOU KEEP ON IMBIBING THE KNOWLEDGE AND KEEP WORKING ON YOUR INNER GHOSTS... This dream shows that I have realized my distortion: lack of love, but in order to touch deeper memories to transform, I have a certain difficulty. I was shown that I lack the ability to learn and actualize knowledge, and tend to find happiness quickly when I can't share with people around, 23/07/2025, 11:17 Draw lots for gifts | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/88054 2/3 can't create joy and love myself inside that seek outside to compensate. YES RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD....ITS BEAUTIFUL TO SEE HOW WITH TIME YOUR INTERPRETATION OF THE DREAMS IS DEEPENING AND EXPANDING DEAR NHU... THE DREAM SHOWS THE REASON BEHIND THE LACK OF LOVE...IT IS BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY TO APPLY THE LAW OF RESONANCE AND TO UNDERSTAND THE DIVINE LAWS AND ALSO BECAUSE YOU HAVE CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES LEARNING WITH LOVE IN YOUR HEART, LOVE TO LEARN NEW THINGS, NEW WAYS OF COMMUNICATING, NEW WAYS OF CONNECTING WITH PARTS OF YOU AND PEOPLE... BY BEING MORE PATIENT, MORE CARING... AND BY BEING NOT AFRAID OF WHAT YOU MIGHT DISCOVER IN YOUR UNCONSCIOUS, IN YOUR OLD CONCEPTS...YOU AS A CENTRAL PERSONALITY IS DOING A GOOD EFFORT TO WORK UPON YOUR MEMORIES BUT STILL THERE IS A RESISTANCE TO EXPLORE (DARK CLASSROOM)...THE RESISTANCE IS DUE TO THE MEMORIES OF LACK OF PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE... ALL STUDENTS IN THE CLASS WANT THE GIFT, SO THEY REFLECT THE MEMORIES WHERE HAPPINESS IS SOUGHT TOO QUICKLY WITHOUT CONCRETELY ACHIEVING SOMETHING ... IT GIVES AN ILLUSION OF A GIFT BUT YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE EXPERIENCE... NOW SLOWLY YOU ARE BECOMING MORE RECEPTIVE TO YOUR MEMORIES AND ARE LEARNING TO BECOME MORE PATIENT WITH YOURSELF AND LEARNING TO WAIT FOR THE RIGHT TIME WHILE YOU KEEP WORKING ON YOURSELF WITH KNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPTANCE... ANGELIC TRANSCENDENCE OF THE OLD MEMORIES FROM THE PAST SO AS TO DEVELOP BEAUTIFUL RECEPTIVITY AND LOVE IN THIS WONDERFUL LEARNING PROCESS WITH ANGEL ACHAIAH & NELKHAEL ÂN

title_pdf: 22 Life - Kaya s math class. last case id: C0196. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 15 October 2021 Angel: 35 Chavakhiah Dream and Analysis: Hi teachers, ANGELIC HELLO NHU This week, I chant angel Chavakhiah with the intention: please help me transform the distortion: lack of love.IT'S A BEAUTIFUL INTENTION :-) In a rather small classroom, closed with 4 walls, a bit cramped, only about 10 students. Mr. Kaya [+ wisdom, spiritual actualization, teaching, healing, leading HE REPRESENTS A PART OF YOUR SPIRITUAL MASCULINE POLARITY... ] is teaching Math [- too calculating, too principled, rigid, arid, lacking in practical application AND MATHEMATICS IS SHOWING YOU THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO LEARN TO MANY PARTS OF YOU THE IMPORTANCE OF THE STRUCTURE BECAUSE MATHEMATIC IS RELATED TO NUMBERS AND NUMBERS ARE RELATED TO THE FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURE OF EVERYTHING. ] . He wears a blue short- sleeved sweater, a white shirt inside like he usually wears. THIS DREAM IS SHOWING CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES TO LEARN SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE AND TO TEACH TO MANY PARTS OF YOU TO STUDY AND EVOLVE. IT MAY HAPPEN THAT WHEN YOU FEEL DISTURBED YOU MAY TRY TO RECALL THE KNOWLEDGE BUT THERE IS A DIFFICULTY TO IMPLEMENT AND GIVE SPACE TO KNOWLEDGE AND LOVE. AND THIS DREAM IS GIVING YOU A STRONG MESSAGE... IN ORDER TO OVERCOME AND TRANSFORM THE LACK OF LOVE, YOU NEED WISDOM... WISDOM IN THE FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURE OF YOUR BEING, TO BE ORGANIZED, HAVING THE RIGOR TO WORK ON YOUR MEMORIES... I feel that my learning is being limited, not expanded and enhanced on the outside (closed and cramped classroom). The Kaya teacher inside me somehow always encourages me to learn knowledge, but I have distortions about deepening and applying knowledge. YES, RIGHTLY INTERPRETED... AND REMEMBER THAT IT IS A PERCENTAGE OF YOU... THIS DREAM IS HELPING YOU TO DEEPEN THE LOVE AND WISDOM INSIDE OF YOU... After the class ended, he adds 5 different papers [- Paper represents the realization of ideas, materialization, reception. Minuses are over-receptive, suffer, changeable. Number 5 is Angel Mahasiah, represent for Rectification of errors. HUMAN Distortions are difficulty rectifying, repairing, acknowledging, regretting one’s errors or forgiving. "5 different papers" symbol means difficulty receiving information and opinions from the outside for repair, too separate between distortions, not understanding the connection between things to be corrected ] to the whole class. Each sheet of paper has both essays and multiple-choice questions. He said that he forgot it in the previous session. He needs everyone to do all the exercises in these 5 sheets. IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE THAT YOUR INNER KAYA SAID HE FORGOT IT MEANS THAT YOU CAN LACK STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATION IN THE SPIRITUAL LEVEL... AND THE NOTION OF ESSAYS IS RELATED TO ORGANIZING INFORMATION, IDEAS TO WRITE SOMETHING WHICH IS RELATED TO A DIFFICULTY, IN THE NEGATIVE ASPECT, TO GATHER YOUR IDEAS AND TO MATERIALIZE THEM (WRITING)... AND THE MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS ARE RELATED TO WANTING TO TEST YOURSELF AND OTHERS... SO EVENTUALLY, IN THIS SPIRITUAL PATH, YOU CAN COMPARE YOURSELF WITH OTHERS, AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE IN YOUR APPRENTICESHIP (MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS) I have difficulty receiving information and opinions from the outside for repair, too separate between distortions, not understanding the connection between things to be corrected. AND YOU CAN COMPLETE WITH THE COMMENTS ABOVE... I don't know how to get everyone to do these 5 sheets. SO YOU SEE A FORM OF DISORGANIZATION (MATH) FROM YOUR INNER KAYA BECAUSE NORMALLY, IT IS HIS RESPONSIBILITY, AS A TEACHER, TO TAKE CARE OF THESE 5 SHEETS. SO YOU SEE HOW YOUR INNER KAYA CAN BE A LITTLE TOO AIRY AND DISORGANIZED... I thought about collecting these exercises into one system [- System represents the synchronization, the process. The minuses point are lack of synchronization, lack of flexibility, too principled, lack of rigor AND IT IS ALSO THE NOTION OF WANTING TO CREATE UNITY (ONE SYSTEM) IN YOUR LEARNING PROCESS... AND THIS IS VERY GOOD... ] (like scanning and uploading them online) for everyone to see. But then, I don't do this. YOU WANT TO AUTOMATE THIS PROCESS OF SELF-EVALUATION BY REGULARLY CHECKING YOURSELF BUT SOMEWHERE YOU STILL LACK THE MOTIVATION TO DO THAT IN A %... AND IT SHOWS ALSO THAT YOU CAN HAVE VERY GOOD IDEA IN YOUR THOUGHT SO AS TO CREATE UNITY AND EFFICIENCY BUT SOME MEMORIES SHOWN ABOVE ARE PREVENTING YOU FROM MATERIALIZING YOUR IDEAS... I have lack of synchronization, lack of flexibility, too principled, lack of rigor. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU ARE SHOWN BEAUTIFUL QUALITIES IN YOU EVEN IF THERE IS A PERCENTAGE OF NOT MATERIALIZING YOUR IDEA (ONE SYSTEM)... YOU CAN SEE YOUR INTELLIGENCE AND THE WISH TO LEARN... AND THIS DREAM IS SHOWING YOU THE MEMORIES THAT ARE WAITING TO BE TRANSFORMED WITH LOVE AND WISDOM Next scene, I was giving these exercise sheets to Khai in the classroom, just me and Khai. Khai is an old elementary school friend. YOU CAN ANALYZE THOSE SYMBOLS :-) IT WILL HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND CERTAIN MEMORIES FROM THE PAST... I think we are doing homework [- homework represents training, go to deep in knowledge and practice. The minus points are lack of training, lack understanding of knowledge, lack of ability to apply in practice, too theory YES... WELL UNDERSTOOD... ] . I feel like I'm forcing Khai to do these exercises. And I feel like I'm mocking Khai, like this exercise is so simple that Khai can't do it, something like that. Khai is now very gentle. I feel like he is suffering, afraid, not daring to speak, not daring to react. And I find Khai very strange. HERE YOU GET THE KEY TO WHY YOU LACK MOTIVATION , SOMETIMES, TO LEARN AND TO SHARE KNOWLEDGE TO MANY PARTS OF YOU... ....YOUR INNER KHAI IS NOT HEARD AND YOU LACK ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PART OF YOU. AND YOU SEE THAT YOU CAN BE TOO EMISSIVE WITH THIS PART OF YOU... YOU SEE ALSO THAT IN YOUR LEARNING PROCESS YOU CAN GO FROM INFERIORITY COMPLEX, IN THE BEGINNING, TO SUPERIORITY COMPLEX, AT THE END OF THE DREAM... YOUR INNER KHAI LACKS RECEPTIVITY DUE TO FEAR AND SUFFERINGS...SO THE PROCESS OF SELF-EVALUATION CAN OPEN UP THE MEMORIES OF SUFFERING, PAINS (MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS)....THUS SUB- CONSCIOUSLY YOU AVOID IT, AT TIMES, AND IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... WE ARE HAPPY THAT YOU CAN SEE THOSE MEMORIES AND THAT YOU ASK THE REAL QUESTION, DEAR NHU... THE LEARNING PROCESS IS ONE THE FUNDAMENTAL BASIS ON AN INITIATE AND WE ARE ALL STUDENTS AND TEACHERS AT THE SAME TIME... AND LEARNING WITH LOVE IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT LOVE CAN BECOME A POISON... ALONG WITH THE ANGEL MANTRA , YOU CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO CHANT THE DIVINE LAWS NHU, LIKE EVIL IS EDUCATIONAL, WE REAP WHAT WE SOW, LAW OF KARMA ETC... IT GRADUALLY HELPS THOSE INNER PARTS OF YOU, WHO ARE AFRAID OF THE CHANGES, OR ARE RIGID BECAUSE OF THEIR ILLUSIONS AND LACK OF KNOWLEDGE...THE MORE YOU CHANT ANGEL MANTRA AND THE DIVINE LAWS MORE RECEPTIVE THESE PARTS OF YOU WILL BE TO KNOWLEDGE AND LOVE... The dream shows that I have distortions related to the lack of ability to deepen knowledge, apply it to reality, lack of synthesis and synchronization. And a part of me accepts it, with no reaction (Khai). And another part of me is still pushing myself to deepen my knowledge. WELL UNDERSTOOD, DEAR NHU... YOU ARE SHOWN ALSO HOW LOVE IS IMPORTANT IN YOUR LEARNING PROCESS... AND NOT ONLY LOVE BUT ALSO WISDOM... THE WISDOM TO BUILD A GOOD STRUCTURE OF APPRENTICESHIP, HAVING THE RIGHT RIGOR, DISCIPLINE WHILE YOU ARE DEEPENING THE UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR SOUL... WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE YOUR VERY GOOD WORK ON YOURSELF... YOU ARE IMPROVING PROFOUNDLY... ANGELIC LOVE AND WISDOM IN YOUR SPIRITUAL APPRENTICESHIP WHILE YOU ARE DEVELOPING ORGANIZATION, RIGOR, PATIENCE, AND HUMILITY WITH NELKHAEL & ACHAIAH ÂN

title_pdf: 23 Dream - Motorbike theft. last case id: C0197. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 22 October 2021 Angel: 39 Rehael Dream and Analysis: Hi teachers, ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU, This week I chanted Rehael with the question: How can I can the right reception? IT IS A GOOD QUESTION AND REMEMBER RECEPTIVITY NEEDS ALSO TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY THE RIGHT EMISSIVITY... BEING ONLY RECEPTIVE CREATES A DISBALANCE IN LIFE... AS EXPLAINED DURING OUR SESSION IN THE ANGELICA CLINIC I ride my moss green motorbike [- Motorbike represents the ability to advance in society on individual level. AND THE MOTORBIKE IS LIKE THE SYMBOL OF THE HORSE BEING ABLE TO FEEL THE FREEDOM OF LIFE... BUT IN THE NEGATIVE ASPECT IT IS ALSO RELATED TO REBELLIOUS ASPECT, BEING TOO INDIVIDUAL... "EACH ONE FOR HIMSELF" Minuses are lack of motivation, lack of ability to move forward. Green represents the 4th Chakra, meaning the heart. The moss green motorbike represents how I advance in the association on individual level, always showing my mind and heart. The minuses are giving too much, giving on purpose, expecting to receive in return ] to a village. YOU CAN ANALYZE THE SYMBOL OF THE VILLAGE SINCE IT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT SYMBOL FOR THE REST OF THE DREAM :-) In this village, the houses are made of wood, quite rudimentary, on the red earth, it seems to be in a mountainous area. PLEASE ANALYZE THE SYMBOL OF THE MOUNTAINOUS AREA... A group of people from the village were gathering in the main courtyard in the center to play something. THE SCENE FURTHER SHOWS US THE REASON AS TO WHY THESE MEMORIES GETS TRIGGERED IN YOU THEREBY INFLUENCING YOUR RECEPTIVITY. The way I move forward in society on individual level is unbalanced between giving and receiving. Sometimes I give too much, sometimes I take too much. And when I give, I have a purpose, a condition. This makes me lack comprehensive vision (mountainous area). It's made up of old memories that I haven't been able to transform (wood, rudimentary, village) HERE THE SYMBOL OF THE VILLAGE SHOWS THE SURVIVAL MODE, THE INSECURITIES AND THE WILD ASPECT IN YOU WHERE YOU CAN BE TOO SELF-CENTERED ON YOUR INSTINCTUAL NEEDS (VILLAGE) AND THE MOUNTAINOUS AREA SHOWS A DYNAMIC OF ISOLATION, DIFFICULTY TO DEVELOP THE GLOBAL VISION IN LIFE... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... AND PLAYING IS SHOWING YOU THE WISH TO CONNECT WITH THE SOCIAL LEVEL BUT ALSO THE LACK OF RESPONSIBILITIES... I visited a house YOU CAN ANALYZE THAT SYMBOL... next to the main yard. I went to meet someone to pick up something or discuss something. There was an old woman walking towards me YOU CAN ANALYZE THAT SYMBOL..., walking very slowly and silently. She got on my motorbike, and then I noticed that I still had the key [- key represents access to resources, topics, people,... Key also represents emission. Minus points are difficulty to access resources, limited, lack of confidence ] on my motorbike. THE OLD WOMAN HERE SYMBOLISES YOUR OLD ANCIENT PATTERNS, MEMORIES RELATED TO YOUR FEMININE ASPECT AND RECEPTIVITY...SO THERE ARE CERTAIN MEMORIES THAT SEEM TO HAVE LOST THE ENERGY AND VIGOUR...BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY VERY STRONG AND CLEVER TO TAKE YOU OVER SOMETIMES (AS YOU SEE IN THE NEXT SCENE)... I gently asked her: "Do you want to test drive my motorbike? Let me guide you." She remained silent, her movements very slow, perhaps because of her old age. Then she took off on the gas and sped away quickly and forcefully. At this time, I realized that the old woman was a robber [- represents poverty, too focused on matter, imbalance in material and spiritual, too focused on results YES INNER POVERTY, THUS THE PERSON SEEK TO SNATCH OR STEAL FROM OTHERS WHAT DOES NOT BELONG TO HIM/HER... AND IT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS SEEN AT THE BEGINNING... SOMETIMES YOU HAVE DIFFICULTIES TO LISTEN, TO BE RECEPTIVE BECAUSE THERE ARE MEMORIES OF DEEP INSECURITIES AND NEEDS FROM THE PAST (OLD WOMAN ROBBER). AND THIS IS THE KEY SYMBOL OF THE DREAM... IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND THE RIGHT RECEPTIVITY TOWARDS THE UNIVERSE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO WORK ON THE INSTINCTUAL NEEDS, FEARS, AND INSECURITIES ... AND YOU ARE DOING THAT WONDERFULLY, DEAR NHU... ] The old woman represents my unconscious memories. Because I'm too focused on the results, matters (robber) that make me over-emissive, difficult to access resources (key) YES RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD. AND AS SAID ABOVE, THIS INNER OLD WOMAN IN YOU WEAKENS YOUR ABILITY TO BE RECEPTIVE BECAUSE THERE ARE MEMORIES OF STEALING FROM OTHERS...AND ALSO BEING ROBBED...SO THESE MEMORIES PREVENT YOU FROM BEING RECEPTIVE... I ran after her, shouting [- Shouting represents desire to get the attention and interest of others, ego. The minus is over-emissive, lack of love, desire is the center BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS ALSO GOOD THAT YOU TRIED TO STOP THE ROBBER... EVEN IF IT IS NOT PERFECT, YOUR MAIN CONSCIENCE AND ANOTHER PART OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO STOP THE OLD MEMORIES OF INSECURITIES, POSSESSIVITY (STEALING), NEEDS AND THIS IS GOOD... ] : Robber! Robber! The person who discussed with me also ran after me to catch the robber to help me, also shouted "Robber" for everyone to help. I tried to follow her, I kept shouting "Robber" very loudly, but I don't understand why the group of people in the main courtyard didn't hear it, even though they were very close to us. THEY DO NOT HEAR BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT RECEPTIVE ENOUGH AT THE MOMENT... AND AS YOU HAVE MENTIONED ABOVE, IT IS BECAUSE THEY WERE PLAYING... SO YOU SEE OLD PATTERNS WHERE YOU ARE MORE SELF-CENTERED, MORE IN A DYNAMIC OF WANTING TO PLAY, NOT HAVING RESPONSIBILITIES IN MATTER (PLAYING) BUT THE ACTION OF CATCHING THE ROBBER SHOWS THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO STOP THE INNER ROBBER OLD WOMAN BUT STILL THERE IS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW OF RESONANCE...YOU MAY SOMETIMES WANT TO FIGHT YOUR INNER INSTINCTS INSTEAD OF ACCEPTING THAT THEY ARE A PART OF YOU, AND CHANTING MANTRA WITH THIS AWARENESS.....FOR E.G YOU CAN SOMETIMES BLAME PEOPLE FOR CERTAIN WRONG ACTIONS AND MAY NOT TAKE THE RESPONSIBITILY FOR YOUR ACTIONS AND INTENTIONS... AND WHEN YOU ARE TOO SELF-CENTERED, IT CREATES THE FEELING OF NOT BEING HELPED BY OTHERS... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... Group of people representing the social level. When I focus too much on emission, on results, so other people (on the social level) don't care what I want. They just focus on their work. YOU CAN COMPLETE THE UNDERSTANDING WITH THE COMMENTS ABOVE... I finally caught up with her and my motorbike. I thought she looks so weak but drives so fast. I struggled with the old woman, she was quite strong. Then I also got the motorbike back, the old woman ran away. YES, THE PAST MAY SEEM TO BE GONE AND NON-EXISTENT BUT IT CAN HAVE A VERY STRONG INFLUENCE ON US EACH MOMENT. THE OLD WOMAN IS STILL ABSCONDING DEAR NHU, WHICH SHOWS THAT A LOT OF AWARENESS IS NEEDED AS YOU ACT IN THE COLLECTIVE AS THE INNER OLD WOMAN CAN EMERGE BECAUSE OF INSECURITIES, FEARS, POSSESSIVITY, GREED (STEALING) . THOUGH THESE MEMORIES ARE OLD BUT THEY CAN BE CLEVER AND STRONG IN REALITY... IT SHOWS ALSO A VERY INTERESTING MECHANISM WHERE PEOPLE CAN PUT THEMSELVES AS A VICTIM (SHOWING WEAKNESS, THE LACK OF STRENGTH) TO OBTAIN WHAT THEY WANT FROM OTHERS AND IT IS A MECHANISM WHERE THEY FEEL THEY CAN ADVANCE IN LIFE BUT "ON THE BACK OF OTHERS"... I found the motivation to move forward in society through transformation, and compassion (not chasing the old woman) YES, THIS TRANSFORMATION IS PROGRESSIVELY HAPPENING WHILE YOU ARE WORKING ON YOUR MEMORIES SHOWN ABOVE... I went to the group of people in the village who were sitting in the middle of the main yard, a bit annoyed, and asked why they didn't help me catch the robber. People turned to look at me in surprise and said: they didn't hear anything. I was startled to realize that from the beginning when I arrived they did not hear anything, even if I and the other person shouted loudly, only I could hear it. AND HERE IT IS INTERESTING THAT ONE PERSON WAS HELPING YOU... IT MEANS THAT IN THE RELATIONAL LEVEL (2 PEOPLE), YOU CAN RECEIVE THE SUPPORT, YOU ARE WILLING TO HELP BUT WHEN IT BECOMES MORE SOCIAL AND COLLECTIVE, THE INSECURITIES, THE LACK OF RESPONSIBILITIES CAN BECOME STRONGER... IN A PERCENTAGE... SOMETIMES YOU MAY ALSO HAVE EXPERIENCED THAT YOU MAY KEEP YOURSELF ALOOF FROM THE ORDEALS OF OTHERS NOT BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO HELP, BUT YOU MAY NOT UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULTY OF THE OTHER PERSON...AND THIS HAPPENS ONLY WHEN YOU ARE IN INNER CONFLICT, NOT AT PEACE, OR FEEL INSECURE WITHIN... SAME WAY, YOU CAN FEEL FOR YOURSELF THAT OTHERS ARE NOT ABLE TO UNDERSTAND YOUR DIFFICULTIES 23/07/2025, 11:17 Motorbike theft | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/88794 2/3 AND WHEN THE ACTIONS ARE ONLY FOCUSSED ON MATTER THE PERSON STOPS LISTENING TO THE INNER WORLD THUS BLOCKING THE RECEPTIVITY. THIS IS WHAT YOUR DREAM IS CONVEYING TO YOU. IT'S BEAUTIFUL TO RECEIVE THIS DREAM NHU. NOW YOU CAN WORK UPON THESE MEMORIES, AND AS THEY TRANSCEND YOU WILL OPEN UP YOURSELF TO EXPERIENCE THE DIVINE SUBMISSION AND RECEPTIVITY... The dream shows that I am receiving too easily (without doubting the old woman from the beginning and still gently talking). And while I only focus on the results, matters, ego, the rest of the society doesn't care about me (didn't hear my voice) BUT REMEMBER THE SOCIETY IT IS ALSO YOU... YOU ARE SHOWN HOW ON THE RELATIONAL LEVEL, YOU CAN SUPPORT AND HELP OTHERS BECAUSE REMEMBER IN YOUR DREAM THERE IS A PART OF YOU WHO IS WILLING TO HELP TO STOP THE ROBBER... AND YOU CAN UPGRADE THIS QUALITY IN YOU TO ANOTHER LEVEL, THE SOCIAL AND COLLECTIVE LEVEL BY TRANSFORMING THE INSTINCTUAL NEEDS, THE NOTION OF BEING TOO SELF-CENTERED, THE SURVIVAL MODE (VILLAGE)... Today, I suddenly thought of something about my old way of thinking. In talking to other people, I always listen to them and guess what they're talking about, asking me a question on purpose. I guess that purpose and answer their question. But it dawned on me that this has the energy of being too focused on results. WELL SELF-OBSERVED DEAR NHU... Because it would make me guess what other people mean, to see what they want rather than really listening to them and feeling their energy. AND YOU WILL NOTICE THAT MANY CONVERSATIONS ARE LIKE THIS... PEOPLE ANSWER TO THEIR OWN THOUGHTS INSTEAD OF REALLY LISTENING... RECEPTIVITY IS SUCH A PROFOUND AND A BEAUTIFUL QUALITY TO ENTER IN THE MULTIDIMENSION OF LIFE... I think my intention of wanting to understand other people's intentions when talking is right, IT DEPENDS, DEAR NHU... IF THERE ARE MEMORIES OF INSECURITIES, FEARS, WANTING TO KNOW TOO MUCH THE INTENTION OF OTHERS, IT CAN CREATE AN ENERGY OF BEING TOO INTRUSIVE IN THE METAPHYSICAL LEVEL... but I asked the wrong question, so my thinking and reception were a bit one-sided from myself, without listening enough to their true intention. WELL ANALYZED... Instead of asking: what is their purpose, I think I should ask: why do they say that. To find out what the meaning of their question is. Is this correct I found? YOU CAN ASK BOTH QUESTIONS... BUT AT THE SAME TIME, WHAT IS IMPORTANT DURING A CONVERSATION, IS TO BE TRULY RECEPTIVE FOR A PERSON... AS IF THE CONVERSATION IS THE ONLY THING THAT EXISTS IN THE PRESENT MOMENT... AND IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO NATURALLY FEEL THE MULTI FREQUENCIES OF THE VOICE... WITHOUT ANALYZING TOO MUCH... RECEPTIVE IS ALSO ABOUT PROVIDING CARING AND BENEVOLENT ENERGY FOR THE PERSON WHO IS TALKING...RECEPTIVITY DEVELOPS WHEN YOU LISTEN WITH OPENNESS AND WITHOUT ANY BIASES, ANY EXPECTATIONS. WHEN YOU ARE THINKING INSIDE AND ASKING QUESTIONS ON PURPOSE AT THAT TIME YOU CAN BECOME TOO EMISSIVE IN THIS INSIDE... AND IN YOUR THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS INSTEAD OF REALLY LISTENING... IT IS LIKE YOUR EMISSIVITY BECOMES MORE POWERFUL THAN YOUR RECEPTIVITY BECAUSE YOU WANT TOO MUCH TO HAVE AN ANSWER FOR YOUR QUESTIONS INSTEAD OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO CONVEY. SO YOU CAN SOMETIMES TRY TO JUST LISTEN AND THIS WILL OPEN THE DOORS TO A NEW AND DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLE WHILE YOU ARE UNDERSTANDING THE MEMORIES THAT PREVENT YOU FROM DEVELOPING THIS BEAUTIFUL CAPACITY TO LISTEN... WOW... IT IS SUCH A PROFOUND DREAM FOR YOUR EVOLUTION... ANGELIC TRANSCENDENCE OF THE OLD PATTERNS WITH LOVE WITH HAZIEL AND ANIEL ENERGY , ÂN

    "dream_text": "I ride my moss green motorbike to a village. In this village, the houses are made of wood, quite rudimentary, on the red earth, it seems to be in a mountainous area. A group of people from the village were gathering in the main courtyard in the center to play something. I visited a house next to the main yard. I went to meet someone to pick up something or discuss something. There was an old woman walking towards me, walking very slowly and silently. She got on my motorbike, and then I noticed that I still had the key on my motorbike. I gently asked her: \"Do you want to test drive my motorbike? Let me guide you.\" She remained silent, her movements very slow, perhaps because of her old age. Then she took off on the gas and sped away quickly and forcefully. At this time, I realized that the old woman was a robber. I ran after her, shouting: Robber! Robber! The person who discussed with me also ran after me to catch the robber to help me, also shouted \"Robber\" for everyone to help. I tried to follow her, I kept shouting \"Robber\" very loudly, but I don't understand why the group of people in the main courtyard didn't hear it, even though they were very close to us. Group of people representing the social level. When I focus too much on emission, on results, so other people (on the social level) don't care what I want. They just focus on their work. I finally caught up with her and my motorbike. I thought she looks so weak but drives so fast. I struggled with the old woman, she was quite strong. Then I also got the motorbike back, the old woman ran away. I found the motivation to move forward in society through transformation, and compassion (not chasing the old woman). I went to the group of people in the village who were sitting in the middle of the main yard, a bit annoyed, and asked why they didn't help me catch the robber. People turned to look at me in surprise and said: they didn't hear anything. I was startled to realize that from the beginning when I arrived they did not hear anything, even if I and the other person shouted loudly, only I could hear it.",

title_pdf: 24 Dream - Fighting with 2 sisters. last case id: C0198. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 29 October 2021 Angel: 39 Rehael Dream mood: Afraid Dream and Analysis: Hi teachers, ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU This week, I continue with the question: How can I can the right reception? IT'S A GOOD INTENTION AND ALSO AT THE SAME TIME BE AWARE OF THE GUIDANCE THAT YOU RECEIVE IN YOUR PREVIOUS DREAMS, AS THAT GUIDANCE ALSO HELPS YOU TO BECOME MORE RECEPTIVE. I live in a boarding house.YOU COULD ANALYSE BOARDING HOUSE HERE I rent alone. The walls and doors, aisles & everything are mostly white [- is the synthesis of all color, represents purity, spiritual AND THIS IS A POSITIVE DEFINITION, DEAR NHU... YOU CAN USE THE STYLE POSITIVE, IN BLUE TO TALK ABOUT THE POSITIVE ASPECT.... Minuses are a person have too strong intention to cleanse who lost in abstraction, over-blown ego WHITE CAN BE A BEAUTIFUL "COLOR" OF PURITY AS YOU HAVE WRITTEN... BUT IF YOU ARE DISTURBED BY THIS SPIRITUAL COLOR IT MEANS THAT YOU CAN HAVE CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES REGARDING THE SPIRITUAL LEVEL... ] , including the inside of my room. I am actively working with my inner self to purify my memories, but I am lost in spiritual knowledge to purify myself. YOU CAN LOOK IT IN THIS WAY, THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE MEDITATE FOR HOURS, THEY MAY DO CERTAIN RITUALS, ETC BUT THEY MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT A PERSON AS HE OR SHE IS. IT IS BECAUSE THEY CAN NOT ACCEPT THEIR OWN RESONANCES. ALSO MEETING OTHERS MAY ALSO TRIGGER THE MEMORIES OF FEARS, VICTIMHOOD ETC...WHICH CAN BE TRANSFORMED WHILE YOU HAVE THE PROPER UNDERSTANDING, WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE F The door of my room is quite strange. It has a full door and a half door [- door represents my inner protection, protect my intimate space. Minueses are intense need to protect myself, fear of being disturbed, robbed, assaulted, burgled. Here I have "a half door" more, it means I have also too open inside, but outside I too protective myself (close all doors) IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD... ] . It's like having 2 wings, but the wall covered half of 1 wing. Both were used normally. The doors are locked quite tight. I often check them when at home. THIS SHOWS THE INSECURITY YOU CAN SOMETIMES FEEL INSIDE, FEAR THAT SOMEONE CAN ENTER IN YOUR INTIMACY... WITHOUT KNOWING THAT INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS AND NEGATIVE EMOTIONS ARE THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE AS CAREFUL AS THE PHYSICAL SAFETY... BECAUSE WHEN THIS NEGATIVITY ENTERS, IT CAN CREATE A LOT OF CONSEQUENCES... :-). Sometimes I'm too open, sometimes I'm too closed. But I would close almost everything about my intimacy, and I became too closed for anyone to understand. YOU CAN SEE THE ABOVE COMMENTS... At this time, I went to check the doors and saw that there had 2 tubes blocking the middle between the door and the wall [- tube represents protection, guidance, to lead emotions (liquids). The wall is representative of the structure. Here the wall of my room should represent the inner structure on the individual level. "2 tubes blocking the middle between the door and the wall" means sometimes I allow my emotions to interfere in building inner structure and protecting intimacy, making things of intimacy need to be protected improperly, easily revealing to others emotionally. Because maybe I have a desire to show it, but I don't know that it needs to be hidden to a certain percentage ] . This make a gap, and the doors were still closed. THE TUBES REPRESENT THE EMISSIVE EMOTIONS I.E THE EMOTIONS WHICH A PART OF YOU WISHES TO BLURT OUT ON THE WORLD. SO YOU SEE THAT WHEN YOU ARE IN THE RELATIONAL LEVEL (NUMBER 2), IF YOU HAVE TOO MUCH EMISSIVITY, IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY BLOCK YOUR RECEPTIVITY, BUT ALSO THE ACCESS OF YOUR INNER STRUCTURE... I'm skeptical of my excessive self-contained (check often). I have mixed feelings of fear and negativity in the process of protecting and building intimacy. I'm afraid someone knows that. When I saw that, I was surprised and tried to push those 2 tubes out so that the door wouldn't open. I feel like something terrible is going to happen when the door is open. SO IT SHOWS THAT, SOMETIMES, YOU HAVE CERTAIN FEARS TO CONNECT WITH THE RELATIONAL AND SOCIAL LEVEL... IT'S LIKE THERE IS A PERCENTAGE OF YOU WHO WISHES TO BE AWAY FROM THE SOCIAL AND RELATIONAL LEVEL... And then, 2 sisters in the 2 opposite rooms [- 2 sisters who I don't know represent parts of my unconscious, it shows how receptive I am. The room opposite represents facing my own intimacy. Minuses are too easily revealing intimate things, too comparative, too receptive, difficulty in building structure ] found myself pushing the 2 tubes out, so they rushed in and intentionally opened the door to my room. I am against them. I don't know these two sisters in real life but I feel like I have to stop them. If they get into my room, I'll meet something very terrible. AND HERE WE ALSO SEE IN THEM TOO MUCH OF EMISSIVITY, AND YOU ARE AFRAID OF THIS ASPECT OF YOU BECAUSE THESE PARTS OF YOU CAN ENTER WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION IN YOUR INTIMACY... AND WHAT IS INTERESTING TO KNOW IS THAT BEHIND A VICTIM THERE IS ALWAYS A PERPETRATOR. SO THE VICTIMHOOD IN YOU MAKES YOU FEEL VULNERABLE AND THUS YOU WISH TO PROTECT TOO MUCH YOUR INTIMACY, NOT LETTING OTHERS ENTER IN YOUR INNER STRUCTURE BUT THERE ARE ALSO THE MEMORIES OF BEING AN AGGRESSOR, WHICH CAN ALSO MANIFEST WHEN YOU ARE IN THE WORLD OUTSIDE. SO YOU SEE THE DUALITY HERE DEAR NHU. THE VICTIM IS AFRAID OF WHAT IS INSIDE OF HIM. SO YOUR INNER SISTERS SHOW YOU YOUR OWN EMOTIONS, WHICH YOU ARE ACTUALLY AFRAID OF RECEIVING IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD... A part of me shows a desire to show intimacy to others NOT REALLY, IT SHOWS AN OVER-PROTECTION OF YOUR INTIMACY BECAUSE THERE ARE MEMORIES WHERE YOU CAN ENTER TOO MUCH IN THE INTIMACY OF OTHERS... AT TIMES..., and dig deeper, but I have a strong resistance, self- protection mechanisms, and intimacy to no one can know and leave myself unscathed by those effects. This could be linked to my emotional freeze. It is a self-forming and defense mechanism. YES, IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD AND SELF-DEFENSE BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WISH YOUR INNER SISTER ENERGY TO TAKE YOU OVER. The two sides struggled for a long time, these two people cursed me a lot. In the end, I was able to push the 2 tubes out and they couldn't get into my room. AND REMEMBER,THE TWO SISTERS ARE ALSO YOU. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL INVITATION FROM UP ABOVE TO MEDITATE ON THIS DREAM AND TO IDENTIFY WHERE IN YOUR LIFE YOU CAN FACE THOSE ENERGIES OF BEING TOO INTRUSIVE, AGGRESSIVE, TOO EMISSIVE IN THE RELATIONAL LEVEL (2 TUBES)... WHETHER IT IS IN YOUR THOUGHTS, EMOTIONS, OR BEHAVIORS... In the end, my resistance was won, and I kept my secrets that I could not reveal to others. But it also shows that revealing and accepting actions from the outside should be gentler, more correct without being too difficult and violent (against 2 sisters). I could look into the situation and talk to the 2 girls to solve the problem, ask why they did it, but I didn't. I chose to resist. This is understandable because inside I have an available mechanism. I need to work more to transform this built-in resistance so that there can be proper reception. That is the answer to my question. YES, YOU HAVE RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD IT. TO BE MORE RECEPTIVE YOU ALSO NEED TO BE RECEPTIVE TO THE INNER SISTERS AND TO UNDERSTAND THEM WHILE YOU ARE TRANSFORMING THEM... SINCE IN THE DREAM YOU SHOWED THE RESISTANCE AGAINST THEM, THUS THE DREAM GIVES THE KEY TO BE MORE RECEPTIVE, AND THAT IS TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR INNER SISTERS... WHY THESE PARTS OF YOU ARE BEHAVING LIKE THAT... IT'S A GOOD DREAM, NHU... UP ABOVE GAVE YOU THIS DREAM BECAUSE YOU ARE READY TO WORK ON THIS ASPECT.THE UNIVERSE WANTS YOU TO COME OUT OF THE INSECURITY AND OTHER DIFFICULT EMOTIONS BY WORKING ON YOUR INNER WORLD STEP BY STEP... BEING MORE OPEN TO OTHERS WITHOUT BEING TOO OPEN... PROTECTING YOUR INTIMACY WITHOUT PROTECTING TOO MUCH BECAUSE OF FEARS... ONCE YOU RIGHTLY UNDERSTAND YOUR INNER SISTERS ASPECT AND START WORKING ON THIS, YOU MAY REALISE THAT YOUR RESONANCES WITH YOUR SISTER MAY CHANGE.YOU COULD BECOME MORE RECEPTIVE TO UNDERSTAND WHY SHE IS THE WAY SHE IS. This week, I also had another intention to see my sister again after weeks of social distancing. I intend to move in with her, and I plan to meet with her to see how the accommodation is arranged. Because I'm still wondering about moving back. I understand in terms of personality that the two sisters are not suitable for living together, although I have been with her a few times before, but most of them I hold back, keep quiet and say nothing. After working with myself, I understood distortions and resonances from family members. Partly, the space of my sister's house was not as airy and comfortable as to where I am now, so I was also quite hesitant. However, as soon as I got home, my mother called me and said that my parents were arguing. Because my parents hadn't same points about buying an exercise machine for my mom. In fact, my parents had quarreled many times before, so this time was no different. But I feel this is a 23/07/2025, 11:18 Fighting with 2 sisters | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/89218 2/3 signal from the universe to me when I set my intention to move in with her. The disagreement between my father and mother represents the imbalance between my masculine and feminine polarities. When I intend to move in with her, it means that I intend to transform memories related to family, 2 polarities, and family issues. It was activated immediately when I intended. And the conflict over the exercise machine showed that my family problems were related to material needs. It shows that I will have to work with material needs to transform negative memories related to family, 2 polarities, and these memories are quite harsh, unpleasant for me (when I just got back home, my mother called.) So here I am shown the distortions, memories and difficulties that I need to transform and overcome if I want to move in with her. IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD NHU... YOU ARE GOING MORE IN-DEPTH IN YOUR ANALYSIS... WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE YOUR GREAT INNER WORK... WE INVITE YOU ALSO TO MEDITATE ON YOUR INTENTION TO MOVE WITH YOUR SISTER... REGARDING THIS DREAM, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF MEMORIES CAN EVENTUALLY EMERGE RELATED TO YOUR INNER STRUCTURE, YOUR INTIMACY, SUCH AS BEING TOO INTRUSIVE IN THE INTIMACY, TOO EMISSIVE (TUBE), TOO PURITANICAL (WHITE) AND IT IS ALSO ALWAYS GOOD TO ASK FOR DREAMS WHAT IS THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR YOUR EVOLUTION... BECAUSE THE UNIVERSE TRULY KNOWS THE RIGHT PATH FOR OUR EVOLUTION... SO YOU NEED TO BE AWARE THAT CONFLICTS MAY ARISE AS YOU CHANGE YOUR PLACE BUT YOU NEED TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO COME BACK TO YOURSELF IN EACH MOMENT AND BE AWARE OF THE ACTIONS YOU MAKE. OTHERWISE, YOU MAY FEEL THAT YOUR DECISION OF MOVING IN WITH YOUR SISTER IS CREATING A DIFFICULTY IN YOUR INNER PEACE. Please help me to see if I interpret this correctly. Thank you. :-) YOU CAN COMPLETE THE UNDERSTANDING IN THE COMMENTS ABOVE... ANGELIC TRANSCENDENCE OF THE INNER FAMILY AND INNER CONFLICTS WITH ANIEL AND JELIEL ENERGY ÂN

PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 5 November 2021 Angel: 68 Habuhiah Dream and Analysis: Hi teachers, ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU, This week, I chanted Habuhiah Angel with the intention: please help me heal the physical illness. IT'S A NICE INTENTION. AND THE DREAM THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED IS SHOWING YOU THE MEMORIES BEHIND THE PHYSICAL ILLNESS... BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW NOW, EVERYTHING IS METAPHYSICAL BEFORE BEING PHYSICAL... EACH ILLNESS HAS ITS ROOT IN THE MEMORIES... I just remember some scenes in my dream. Here is the dream. I and some people stayed in a room, inside an old castle [- castle represents for memories of power, authority, wealth, protection. Minuses are selfishness, abuse of power, arrogance, pride, ignore the Laws of karma WELL ANALYZED... AND OLD IS ALSO MENTIONING THAT YOU ARE VISITING OLD MEMORIES FROM THE PAST... ] . The castle was built like a circle [- a tendency to go round in circles, repeating the same patterns, same negatives experimentations without learning any lessons THE CIRCLE ALSO REPRESENTS CONCENTRATION, AND THE ATTITUDE TO WANTING RECEIVE AND NOT SHARE WITH OTHERS. SO HERE IT SHOWS ABUSE OF POWER TO ACCUMULATE THE RESOURCES FOR ONESELF. ] , wrapped around a large courtyard [- represents communication at the social level. Communicating, interacting, learning, playing games. Minus points are difficulty in interacting with others, and interacting with parts of me, not serious, playful attitude HERE THE COURTYARD SHOWS THE ATTITUDE TO SEPARATE , HIDE AND KEEP AWAY FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD. AND IT SHOWS ALSO THE MEMORIES WHERE YOU CAN BE MORE IN A DYNAMIC OF BEING SELF-CENTERED, MORE FOCUSED ON YOUR PERSONAL NEEDS, MORE CONCENTRATED ON YOUR PERSONAL AND SOCIAL EXPANSION... ] in the middle. The climate is quite hot and dry [- Climate belongs to the thinking level. Climate is also related to emotions. Dry and hot indicates that thoughts and feelings are difficult to develop, harsh on myself and one's surroundings YES, THE LACK OF GOOD AND NOURISHING EMOTIONS ] . HERE YOU ARE SHOWN A STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN YOU WHICH SHOWS THE MEMORIES RELATED TO POWER, CONTROL, AND OPERATING WITH A LACK OF EMOTIONS... YOU ARE GOING DEEP DOWN IN YOUR MEMORIES, DEAR NHU... SO YOU SEE THAT YOUR PHYSICAL BODY HAS CERTAIN LIMITATIONS SUCH AS HEADACHES OR DIFFICULTIES WITH BLOOD PRESSURE BECAUSE, IN THE PAST, YOU COULD HAVE BEEN TOO INTENSE IN YOUR MANIFESTATION, TOO FOCUSED ON THE NEEDS, THE POWER... AND THUS IT CREATES CONSEQUENCES IN YOUR THOUGHT, IN YOUR VITAL ENERGY, YOUR FORCE OF MANIFESTATION... At the social level, in my work, I am abusing my power, demonstrating my power to materialize and develop my work, which causes difficult emotions for myself and those around me. This is how I did it before, and I'm repeating it, I haven't been able to adjust my communication and actions at work with people around, it's rooted in old memories .YES YOU HAVE RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD IT, THE MEMORIES SHOWN ABOVE IS INFLUENCING YOUR ACTIONS IN SOME %... AND WHILE YOU ARE ABLE TO SEE YOUR NEGATIVE MEMORIES, IT IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER YOUR QUALITIES... YOUR QUALITIES, THE LOVE AND WISDOM ARE THE FORCES THAT WILL HELP YOU TO TRANSFORM ANY NEGATIVITIES... Outside there is a monster [- represents instinctive needs, forcing a lot of power, lack of faith, anger and relleious, a desire to control, seeking glory YES... MONSTER IS A CONCENTRATION OF INSTINCTUAL NEEDS... A PART OF YOU THAT IS READY TO DO ANYTHING TO OBTAIN THE POWER, TO SATISFY MATERIALISTIC NEEDS... ] trying to kill us and especially me. Everyone hides [- represents a lack of acceptance, fear of unconscious memories, need to hide and dare not face the truth, lack of understanding of the law of resonance and karma WELL UNDERSTOOD... YOU SEE THAT YOU CAN FEAR YOUR OWN NEEDS... IT IS A BEAUTIFUL INVITATION TO RE-EDUCATE THESE NEEDS WITH LOVE AND PATIENCE... ] in the room. WHEN YOU OPERATE SOMETIMES WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF ABUSE OF POWER, ARROGANCE, AND PRIDE, YOU DO NOT FEEL AT EASE AND PEACEFUL,. SO YOU TRY TO HIDE AWAY FROM THESE INSTINCTUAL ENERGIES... AT TIMES... AND IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... AS THE LAW OF RESONANCE OPERATES EACH MOMENT, HERE YOU ALSO GET THE ANSWER TO WHY SOMETIMES YOU LIKE TO STAY ALONE AND ALOOF FROM OTHERS. BECAUSE SOMETIMES, WHEN YOU HAVE THE ATTITUDE OF POWER I.E YOU WANT TO HAVE CONTROL OVER A SITUATION, SIMULTANEOUSLY YOU FEEL THE MONSTER IN OTHERS, WHICH IS ACTUALLY YOUR OWN INNER MONSTER... WOW... IT IS VERY PROFOUND TO UNDERSTAND THAT... AND AT THE SAME TIME, KNOWING THAT, YOU DON'T NEED TO JUDGE YOURSELF BUT HAVING IN YOUR INTENTION TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON... I lack of acceptance, lack of understanding of the Law of resonance and Karma, so I can't understand the difficult, I tend to seek and show instinctive needs by forcing a lot of power. Some of the men opened the door slightly to fight [- represents a lack of confidence, lack of security, over emission, repressed too much to be unable to control, wanting to oppose the inner and outer parts AND FIGHTING REPRESENT AN ASPECT OF AGGRESSIVITY AND REPRESSION... IT SHOWS THE DIFFICULTY TO ACCEPT AND TRANSFORM NEGATIVE MEMORIES, INSTINCTUAL NEEDS THAT CAN TAKE TOO MUCH SPACE IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS... ] the monster, but then they died too. AND THEN YOU WISH TO FIGHT YOUR INNER MONSTER BY DOING CERTAIN ACTIONS IN CONCRETE, BUT YOU LOSE YOUR ENERGY SOON, BECAUSE IN THOSE MOMENTS YOU MAY FORGET TO APPLY THE LAW OF RESONANCE. THE INNER MONSTER CAN'T BE KILLED BUT CAN BE TRANSCENDED WITH ACCEPTANCE, LOVE, AND WISDOM. THAT IS WHY YOU FEEL A LACK OF ENERGY DEAR NHU BECAUSE FIGHTING DEPLETES YOUR POTENTIAL, YOUR RESOURCES, YOUR VITAL ENERGY, YOUR FORCE OF MANIFESTATION... Some men show a part of my masculinity polarity. It shows that I am gradually finding a way to face my instinctive needs, my abuse of power, but I have not done it properly, so my efforts are canceled and unsuccessful. The monster inside of me is still too big and it's overwhelming me WE MAKE IT TOO BIG BY NOT ACCEPTING IT AS A PART OF OURSELVES, AND AT THE SAME TIME, IT BECOMES BIG BECAUSE OF AN ACCUMULATION OVER A LONG (PAST) PERIOD OF TIME... IT STARTS TO LOSE ITS MONSTER-NESS WHEN WE ACCEPT IT WITH LOVE AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE REASON BEHIND IT... AND THE ANGELICA MANTRA WILL REALLY HELP YOU TO CONCENTRATE YOUR INTENTION, YOUR FOCUS TO TRANSFORM ANY NEGATIVITIES... I remember I ran to a stair [- difficult rising onto the thought level and gaining access to the casual CAUSAL world, difficult incarnating and entering action to materialize our potential WELL UNDERSTOOD... ] . Monsters chase me. I fight with the monster. And I don't remember how it ended. SO WHEN YOU FEEL EXHAUSTED AND CAN'T FIGHT THE INNER MONSTER ANYMORE, YOU ESCAPE TO THE WORLD OF THOUGHTS, GIVING YOURSELF THE REASONS FOR BEING THE WAY YOU ARE. BUT THAT DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. AND HERE YOU CAN SEE AN AUTISTIC ATTITUDE WHERE YOU ARE FACING CONCENTRATED NEEDS MIXED WITH AGGRESSIVITY AND REPRESSION... YOU ARE GOING UP SO AS NOT TO FEEL THE DIFFICULTIES... HERE YOU ARE SHOWN A PATTERN WHERE YOU WERE A MONK IN PAST LIFE AND WHERE IT WAS EASIER TO FLEE IN YOUR THOUGHT, FLEE MATTER THAN FACING DIFFICULTIES IN THE CONCRETE LEVEL... YOU RECEIVE AN IMPORTANT DREAM FOR YOUR EVOLUTION, DEAR NHU... WE ARE HAPPY THAT YOU RECEIVE THIS KIND OF DREAM... YOU ARE DIVING DEEP DOWN INTO YOUR MEMORIES YOU ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS, OF THIS ALCHEMY DEAR NHU. THE MORE YOU APPLY THE LAW OF RESONANCE AND ACCEPT AND TRANSFORM THE INNER MONSTER AS A PART OF YOU, THE MORE YOU WILL FEEL FREE AND BUILD YOUR GREAT POTENTIAL... AND YOU HAVE A PART OF YOUR ANSWER CONCERNING THE PHYSICAL ILLNESS, THE HEADACHE IS ALSO BECAUSE OF THE INNER FIGHT AGAINST THE INNER MONSTER. THE MONSTER IS NOT GOING TO VANISH. IT SHOWS UP SO THAT YOU CAN FACE IT AND HELP IT TRANSCEND ITS WRONG NOTIONS AND BELIEFS WITH LOVE AND RIGOR... WHILE SAYING "NO" THE RIGHT WAY WHEN THOSE NEEDS ARE EMERGING NOT POSITIVELY... THE DREAM ALSO SHOWS IN CERTAIN % WHY YOU DO NOT FEEL AT EASE WITH YOUR FAMILY, BECAUSE THERE IS A DYNAMICS OF CONTROLLING EACH OTHER,I.E AN ATTITUDE TO ABUSE THE POWER. THE ARROGANCE, ABUSE OF POWER, ACCUMULATIONS, LACK OF SHARING, ETC, IS BECAUSE OF LACK OF RIGHT KNOWLEDGE. AS YOU GRADUALLY ACQUIRE THE NEW KNOWLEDGE EACH DAY, PROGRESSIVELY OTHER PARTS OF YOU WILL ALSO BECOME RECEPTIVE TO THIS KNOWLEDGE AND WITH THE EFFORTS THAT YOU ARE PROVIDING, YOU WILL BE A NEW ANGELIC NHU... WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE YOUR GREAT EFFORTS, DEAR INITIATE... This dream shows the origin of my physical illness, specifically I have frequent headaches, it is because I have abused my power, I lack inner security, lack of confidence, lack of confidence, lack of understanding the law of resonance and karma. So, these distortions 23/07/2025, 11:18 Fight with monsters | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/89600 2/3 gradually accumulate and turn into a physical disease. I need to work to transform these distortions. IT IS BEAUTIFULLY SAID AND UNDERSTOOD... AND IN THIS DREAM, THERE IS VICTIM CONSCIOUSNESS AND BEHIND THAT STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS, THERE IS THE PERPETRATOR CONSCIOUSNESS. SO THESE DUALITIES CREATE DISCREPANCIES IN YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS , AND WHICH MAY SOMETIMES MANIFEST AS A HEADACHE. AND WE CAN MAKE AN ANALOGY WITH THE STAIRS AT THE END AS THE THOUGHT LEVEL AND THE HEAD THAT IS ALSO RELATED TO THE THOUGHT LEVEL, IT SHOWS THAT WHEN YOU TRIED TO FLEE CERTAIN NEGATIVE MEMORIES, CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES, YOU CAN BECOME TOO INTELLECTUAL AND TOO DRY (CLIMATE HOT AND DRY) SO IT CREATES HEADACHES BECAUSE OF A LACK OF EMOTION WHILE YOU ARE MANIFESTING YOURSELF... SO INSTEAD OF EMPLOYING YOUR ENERGY IN SUPPRESSING THESE DUALITIES, DIFFICULTIES, YOU CAN USE YOUR ENERGY IN ACCEPTING AND TRANSFORMING THESE MEMORIES... WE KNOW THAT YOU HAVE THOSE QUALITIES, DEAR NHU... YOU HAVE WELL UNDERSTOOD THE ESSENCE OF YOUR DREAM... ANGELIC TRANSCENDENCE OF THE INNER MONSTER WITH LOVE, CLEMENCY AND RIGOR WITH VASARIAH & LEHAHIAH ÂN

SO YOU SEE THAT YOUR PHYSICAL BODY HAS CERTAIN LIMITATIONS SUCH AS HEADACHES OR DIFFICULTIES WITH BLOOD PRESSURE BECAUSE, IN THE PAST, YOU COULD HAVE BEEN TOO INTENSE IN YOUR MANIFESTATION, TOO FOCUSED ON THE NEEDS, THE POWER... AND THUS IT CREATES CONSEQUENCES IN YOUR THOUGHT, IN YOUR VITAL ENERGY, YOUR FORCE OF MANIFESTATION... At the social level, in my work, I am abusing my power, demonstrating my power to materialize and develop my work, which causes difficult emotions for myself and those around me. This is how I did it before, and I'm repeating it, I haven't been able to adjust my communication and actions at work with people around, it's rooted in old memories .YES YOU HAVE RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD IT, THE MEMORIES SHOWN ABOVE IS INFLUENCING YOUR ACTIONS IN SOME %... AND WHILE YOU ARE ABLE TO SEE YOUR NEGATIVE MEMORIES, IT IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER YOUR QUALITIES... YOUR QUALITIES, THE LOVE AND WISDOM ARE THE FORCES THAT WILL HELP YOU TO TRANSFORM ANY NEGATIVITIES... Represents instinctive needs, forcing a lot of power, lack of faith, anger and relleious, a desire to control, seeking glory YES... MONSTER IS A CONCENTRATION OF INSTINCTUAL NEEDS... A PART OF YOU THAT IS READY TO DO ANYTHING TO OBTAIN THE POWER, TO SATISFY MATERIALISTIC NEEDS... Represents a lack of acceptance, fear of unconscious memories, need to hide and dare not face the truth, lack of understanding of the law of resonance and karma WELL UNDERSTOOD... YOU SEE THAT YOU CAN FEAR YOUR OWN NEEDS... IT IS A BEAUTIFUL INVITATION TO RE-EDUCATE THESE NEEDS WITH LOVE AND PATIENCE... WHEN YOU OPERATE SOMETIMES WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF ABUSE OF POWER, ARROGANCE, AND PRIDE, YOU DO NOT FEEL AT EASE AND PEACEFUL,. SO YOU TRY TO HIDE AWAY FROM THESE INSTINCTUAL ENERGIES... AT TIMES... AND IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... AS THE LAW OF RESONANCE OPERATES EACH MOMENT, HERE YOU ALSO GET THE ANSWER TO WHY SOMETIMES YOU LIKE TO STAY ALONE AND ALOOF FROM OTHERS. BECAUSE SOMETIMES, WHEN YOU HAVE THE ATTITUDE OF POWER I.E YOU WANT TO HAVE CONTROL OVER A SITUATION, SIMULTANEOUSLY YOU FEEL THE MONSTER IN OTHERS, WHICH IS ACTUALLY YOUR OWN INNER MONSTER... WOW... IT IS VERY PROFOUND TO UNDERSTAND THAT... AND AT THE SAME TIME, KNOWING THAT, YOU DON'T NEED TO JUDGE YOURSELF BUT HAVING IN YOUR INTENTION TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON... I lack of acceptance, lack of understanding of the Law of resonance and Karma, so I can't understand the difficult, I tend to seek and show instinctive needs by forcing a lot of power. Represents a lack of confidence, lack of security, over emission, repressed too much to be unable to control, wanting to oppose the inner and outer parts AND FIGHTING REPRESENT AN ASPECT OF AGGRESSIVITY AND REPRESSION... IT SHOWS THE DIFFICULTY TO ACCEPT AND TRANSFORM NEGATIVE MEMORIES, INSTINCTUAL NEEDS THAT CAN TAKE TOO MUCH SPACE IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS... AND THEN YOU WISH TO FIGHT YOUR INNER MONSTER BY DOING CERTAIN ACTIONS IN CONCRETE, BUT YOU LOSE YOUR ENERGY SOON, BECAUSE IN THOSE MOMENTS YOU MAY FORGET TO APPLY THE LAW OF RESONANCE. THE INNER MONSTER CAN'T BE KILLED BUT CAN BE TRANSCENDED WITH ACCEPTANCE, LOVE, AND WISDOM. THAT IS WHY YOU FEEL A LACK OF ENERGY DEAR NHU BECAUSE FIGHTING DEPLETES YOUR POTENTIAL, YOUR RESOURCES, YOUR VITAL ENERGY, YOUR FORCE OF MANIFESTATION... WE MAKE IT TOO BIG BY NOT ACCEPTING IT AS A PART OF OURSELVES, AND AT THE SAME TIME, IT BECOMES BIG BECAUSE OF AN ACCUMULATION OVER A LONG (PAST) PERIOD OF TIME... IT STARTS TO LOSE ITS MONSTER-NESS WHEN WE ACCEPT IT WITH LOVE AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE REASON BEHIND IT... AND THE ANGELICA MANTRA WILL REALLY HELP YOU TO CONCENTRATE YOUR INTENTION, YOUR FOCUS TO TRANSFORM ANY NEGATIVITIES... Represents difficult rising onto the thought level and gaining access to the casual CAUSAL world, difficult incarnating and entering action to materialize our potential WELL UNDERSTOOD... SO WHEN YOU FEEL EXHAUSTED AND CAN'T FIGHT THE INNER MONSTER ANYMORE, YOU ESCAPE TO THE WORLD OF THOUGHTS, GIVING YOURSELF THE REASONS FOR BEING THE WAY YOU ARE. BUT THAT DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. AND HERE YOU CAN SEE AN AUTISTIC ATTITUDE WHERE YOU ARE FACING CONCENTRATED NEEDS MIXED WITH AGGRESSIVITY AND REPRESSION... YOU ARE GOING UP SO AS NOT TO FEEL THE DIFFICULTIES... HERE YOU ARE SHOWN A PATTERN WHERE YOU WERE A MONK IN PAST LIFE AND WHERE IT WAS EASIER TO FLEE IN YOUR THOUGHT, FLEE MATTER THAN FACING DIFFICULTIES IN THE CONCRETE LEVEL... YOU RECEIVE AN IMPORTANT DREAM FOR YOUR EVOLUTION, DEAR NHU... WE ARE HAPPY THAT YOU RECEIVE THIS KIND OF DREAM... YOU ARE DIVING DEEP DOWN INTO YOUR MEMORIES YOU ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS, OF THIS ALCHEMY DEAR NHU. THE MORE YOU APPLY THE LAW OF RESONANCE AND ACCEPT AND TRANSFORM THE INNER MONSTER AS A PART OF YOU, THE MORE YOU WILL FEEL FREE AND BUILD YOUR GREAT POTENTIAL... AND YOU HAVE A PART OF YOUR ANSWER CONCERNING THE PHYSICAL ILLNESS, THE HEADACHE IS ALSO BECAUSE OF THE INNER FIGHT AGAINST THE INNER MONSTER. THE MONSTER IS NOT GOING TO VANISH. IT SHOWS UP SO THAT YOU CAN FACE IT AND HELP IT TRANSCEND ITS WRONG NOTIONS AND BELIEFS WITH LOVE AND RIGOR... WHILE SAYING \"NO\" THE RIGHT WAY WHEN THOSE NEEDS ARE EMERGING NOT POSITIVELY... THE DREAM ALSO SHOWS IN CERTAIN % WHY YOU DO NOT FEEL AT EASE WITH YOUR FAMILY, BECAUSE THERE IS A DYNAMICS OF CONTROLLING EACH OTHER,I.E AN ATTITUDE TO ABUSE THE POWER. THE ARROGANCE, ABUSE OF POWER, ACCUMULATIONS, LACK OF SHARING, ETC, IS BECAUSE OF LACK OF RIGHT KNOWLEDGE. AS YOU GRADUALLY ACQUIRE THE NEW KNOWLEDGE EACH DAY, PROGRESSIVELY OTHER PARTS OF YOU WILL ALSO BECOME RECEPTIVE TO THIS KNOWLEDGE AND WITH THE EFFORTS THAT YOU ARE PROVIDING, YOU WILL BE A NEW ANGELIC NHU... WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE YOUR GREAT EFFORTS, DEAR INITIATE... This dream shows the origin of my physical illness, specifically I have frequent headaches, it is because I have abused my power, I lack inner security, lack of confidence, lack of confidence, lack of understanding the law of resonance and karma. So, these distortions gradually accumulate and turn into a physical disease. I need to work to transform these distortions. IT IS BEAUTIFULLY SAID AND UNDERSTOOD... AND IN THIS DREAM, THERE IS VICTIM CONSCIOUSNESS AND BEHIND THAT STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS, THERE IS THE PERPETRATOR CONSCIOUSNESS. SO THESE DUALITIES CREATE DISCREPANCIES IN YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS , AND WHICH MAY SOMETIMES MANIFEST AS A HEADACHE. AND WE CAN MAKE AN ANALOGY WITH THE STAIRS AT THE END AS THE THOUGHT LEVEL AND THE HEAD THAT IS ALSO RELATED TO THE THOUGHT LEVEL, IT SHOWS THAT WHEN YOU TRIED TO FLEE CERTAIN NEGATIVE MEMORIES, CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES, YOU CAN BECOME TOO INTELLECTUAL AND TOO DRY (CLIMATE HOT AND DRY) SO IT CREATES HEADACHES BECAUSE OF A LACK OF EMOTION WHILE YOU ARE MANIFESTING YOURSELF... SO INSTEAD OF EMPLOYING YOUR ENERGY IN SUPPRESSING THESE DUALITIES, DIFFICULTIES, YOU CAN USE YOUR ENERGY IN ACCEPTING AND TRANSFORMING THESE MEMORIES... WE KNOW THAT YOU HAVE THOSE QUALITIES, DEAR NHU... YOU HAVE WELL UNDERSTOOD THE ESSENCE OF YOUR DREAM... ANGELIC TRANSCENDENCE OF THE INNER MONSTER WITH LOVE, CLEMENCY AND RIGOR WITH VASARIAH & LEHAHIAH ÂN",

title_pdf: 26 Dream - Killed by genetically modified monsters. last case id: C0200. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 12 November 2021 Angel: 68 Habuhiah Dream mood: Scare, afraid Dream and Analysis: Hi teachers, ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU, This week, my intention is still : please help me heal my physics illness. Dream I was in the form of a young, thin, weak, timid, frightened young man [- represents my masculine polarity, my ability to manifest. It shows weakness, uncertainty, lack of security, lack of honesty ALSO A DIFFICULTY TO ASSERT DO THE RIGHT ACTION BECAUSE YOU ARE BEING DRIVEN BY THE NECESSITY TO BE WITH THE BOSSES AND FOLLOW WHAT THEY DO ] I travel with my bosses [- abuse of power, showing position, lack of internal security so need external power to compensate, lack of self-confidence ] to guide them around the beautiful scenery. There are 4 people (not including me), both male and female. All are my bosses. IT SHOWS AN INNER STRUCTURE OF MANIFESTATION IN YOU. THESE ARE THE MEMORIES THAT INFLUENCE YOU ON THE UNCONSCIOUS LEVEL AND YOU CAN ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEM. THEY ARE YOUR INNER BOSSES SO THEY REPRESENT HOW YOU ACT OUT WHEN YOU HAVE A POWER OVER CERTAIN OUTCOMES. AND IN SUCH MOMENTS YOU HAVE CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES ASSERTING AND ACTING IN THE RIGHT MANNER. AND THE BOSSES ARE ALSO RELATED TO YOUR POWER OF DECISIONS, YOUR LEADERSHIP... SOMETIMES YOU CAN LACK CONFIDENCE (YOUNG, THIN, WEAK) IN THE WAY YOU MAKE DECISIONS, YOU MANIFEST, SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE TOO CONFIDENT, WANTING TO DECIDE TOO MUCH (INNER BOSSES)... My inner masculinity is abusing power to control me excessively, the imbalance between two polarities. We went to a resort [- wastefulness, laziness, indulgence, lack of discipline, lack of ability to follow rules ] that seemed to be in Ha Nam province, a rather far province (maybe). The resort is located on a high hill, overlooking the sea. The resort is quite luxurious, spacious, with many trees, quiet and especially without cameras [- those who live in the past, or remember, inability to learn lessons from the past to correct in the future, conservative, lack the ability to actualize ] . They come here to relax because there is no surveillance camera. It seems that these people do jobs that are not very transparent. THIS SHOWS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE DRIVEN BY THE INNER BOSSES ENERGY. YOU MAY TRY TO ELEVATE TO A STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHERE YOU CONVINCE YOURSELF TO DO CERTAIN ACTIONS WHICH YOU KNOW ARE NOT RIGHT OR THE ACTIONS WHICH ARE NOT TRANSPARENT OR CLEARLY VISIBLE TO THE OTHERS . YOU MIGHT FEEL RELAXED AND REJUVENATED IN SUCH MOMENTS BUT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT RELAXATION... AND YOU SEE ALSO IN THIS SCENE HOW SOMETIMES THE MATERIALISTIC NEEDS CAN BE STRONG (QUITE LUXURIOUS SPACE, ETC.) SO HERE IT SHOWS THAT YOU CAN HIDE CERTAIN NEEDS BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT THAT OTHERS CAN SEE CERTAIN NEGATIVE DISTORTIONS... BUT REMEMBER, THIS DREAM IS A PERCENTAGE OF YOU... YOU HAVE MANY QUALITIES THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS REMEMBER I am in a state of laziness, wanting to rest, reminiscing about the past, lack of discipline. This happens when I want to hide, hide a part related to work, do not want to be clear and transparent. YES RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD. IT'S LIKE HIDING THE INTENTIONS ALSO... Everyone's having a good time, and I'm showing them around. There are genetically modified monsters [- monster represents instinctive needs, forcing a lot of power, lack of faith, anger and relleious, a desire to control, seeking glory. Genes are one of the most basic things that make up a person. Genetic modification means that human nature is changed, becomes more negative, does not understand karma, so it forms revenge VERY NICELY UNDERSTOOD. YES, IT REPRESENTS A STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN THE ANIMALISTIC INSTINCTS ARE MIXED WITH THE HUMAN INTENTIONS AND ACTIONS ] who come to chase us, to kill and eat. SO WHEN YOU OPERATE WITH THE INNER BOSSES ENERGY IN THE COLLECTIVE, YOU START TO LOSE YOUR ENERGY WITH THE INNER CONFLICT GOING ON. ALSO, YOU MAY FEEL THAT THE ACTIONS/EXPECTATIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE ARE DRAINING AWAY YOUR MOTIVATION. AND THE MONSTER IS ALSO THE NOTION OF A CONCENTRATION OF NEEDS, BEING READY TO SATISFY THE NEEDS... AND IT ANSWERS ALSO THE QUESTION YOU ASKED IN THE PAST, THAT: WHY YOU WERE SO FOCUSED ON MAKING MONEY... UNTIL A POINT YOU HAD MAJOR DIFFICULTIES INSIDE YOU... AND THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE NEED FOR LUXURIOUS THINGS, NOURISHING NEGATIVE THINGS WITHOUT BEING SEEN... My instinctual needs, power-focused needs are controlling me, causing my fundamentals to break, change. IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... DEAR NHU... I ran away into the deep forest [- related to the emotional world, representing a part of the unconscious. Who love deep forest is like to anonymous, do not like to show themselves outside, lack the ability to actualize, lack confidence YES... AND THE FOREST REPRESENTS BOTH THE ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE REIGN... SO IT TOUCHES YOUR UNCONSCIOUS EMOTIONS AND PARTS OF YOUR INSTINCTUAL NEEDS, BUT ALSO FORCES OF MANIFESTATION (ANIMALS) THAT YOU ARE DISCOVERING... ] . Suddenly I saw a group of people having fun camping. Everyone is going camping on a bus. On the bus, people divided into many groups to play. I ask them to join and everyone is very welcome. THE INNER MONSTER IN YOU TRIGGERS MEMORIES OF ESCAPING FROM THE DIFFICULTY. BUT AGAIN THAT IS MOMENTARILY, YOU MAY FEEL RELAXED FOR SOME TIME BY ESCAPING THE REALITY IN YOUR MIND FOR A WHILE BUT AGAIN YOU ENCOUNTER YOUR INNER MONSTERS. AND YOU ARE LIVING AN ANGELIC PROCESS OF DEEP CHANGE, DEAR INITIATE... YOUR DNA IS CHANGING POSITIVELY AS YOU ARE WORKING ON YOURSELF... THIS DREAM IS THERE SO YOU CAN DEEPEN YOUR INNER WORK, WITH SELF-COMPASSION... I dug deep into the unconscious, looking for peace and security. But it also shows hiding deeper, not facing the truth. I go inside the bus. I sat down and saw monsters inside the bus seats [- Seats represent reception, containment, fulcrum. Bus represents a slow, unhurried, disciplined progress on the social level. The bus seat represents reception at the social level and in the process of communication, moving forward in society. Minus point is too receptive, too slow ] . These seats are naturally connected by a zipper [- represents connection, protection. Minus points are lack of ability to connect internal parts, lack of ability to connect to outside, isolation, over-protection, lack of ability to express outside ] . People say take it off because it's so weird. But when someone pulls out, I see the monsters inside, I'm scared, I stop them. HERE YOU ARE SHOWN THE MEMORIES OF DIFFICULTY IN THE SOCIAL ADVANCEMENT DUE TO LACK OF RECEPTIVITY AND OPERATING THROUGH THE INNER MONSTER ENERGY... IT MEANS THAT YOU CAN BE AFFECTED IN THE WAY YOU ADVANCE ON THE SOCIAL LEVEL... IN SOCIETY, YOU CAN HAVE EVENTUALLY HAVE RESONANCES WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LOT OF INSTINCTUAL NEEDS... IT'S A PROFOUND DREAM NHU THAT SHOWS YOU WHY YOU DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN YOUR WORK, IT'S BECAUSE IN YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS YOU ARE AWARE OF THE INNER MONSTERS AND YOU ARE AWARE THAT SUCH ACTION WILL CREATE REPERCUSSIONS... I lack social receptivity, I'm too isolated, I don't get along with society, I lack the ability to connect with other parts of me, YES, BUT WITH TIME AS YOU KEEP DOING THE PROFOUND WORK ON YOURSELF, THE OTHER PARTS OF YOU WILL ALSO BECOME MORE RECEPTIVE TO LEARN THE KNOWLEDGE which slows down my advancement in society. I'm afraid of expressing myself on a social level, everyone finds me weird. But I realized that I'm the only one who can see the monsters on the seats, no one else can see right now. But this strangeness is actually only I can see and this self-concealment is only seen and felt by me. People don't see my concealment, they just find it strange. YOU ARE AN OLD SOUL NHU, SO THE TRUTH WHICH YOU CAN SEE DEEPLY MIGHT NOT BE SEEN BY OTHERS. AN OLD SOUL IS AWARE OF EVEN THE SLIGHTEST OF MISACTION BECAUSE IT HAS SEEN THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE MISACTIONS IN MANY PREVIOUS LIVES. THE FACT THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE THIS DREAM IS THAT YOUR SOUL DEEP DOWN WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES OF EXCESSIVE AND CONCENTRATED NEEDS... (LUXURIOUS PLACES, MONSTERS, ETC.) . AND YOU WANT TO CHANGE THOSE NEGATIVE MEMORIES, AND YOU ARE BRAVE TO THUS SEE THIS IN DREAM, BECAUSE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TRANSCEND THESE INNER MONSTERS WITH YOUR PROFOUND WORK ON YOURSELF... AND REMEMBER THAT IN THIS DREAM, YOU ARE ALSO THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT CANNOT SEE THE MONSTERS... IT MEANS THAT YOUR MAIN CONSCIENCE IS ABLE TO SEE THOSE CONCENTRATED NEEDS BUT SOMETIMES YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO DISCERN THOSE INNER MONSTERS WHEN THEY EMERGE FROM YOUR UNCONSCIOUSNESS... Then, the monsters came out (from the seats) and others came in (from out of the bus), so everyone could see. But these monsters just want to kill me. Then, one of them appeared next to me, and it killed me. And when people realized my weirdness, they knew I was hiding, then I was taken over by this very hidden part. YES, PEOPLE MAY NOT REALIZE THE INNER TURMOIL YOU ARE GOING THROUGH. AND ALSO THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE 23/07/2025, 11:19 Killed by genetically modified monsters | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/89944 2/3 TO HELP YOU AS THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE GOING THROUGH. BUT YOU CAN ALSO LOOK AT IT ANOTHER WAY NHU, BECAUSE OF YOUR TENDENCY TO ISOLATE, SOMETIMES YOU MAY ALSO NOT BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE ORDEALS OF OTHERS. AND AT THE SAME TIME, YOU ARE VERY SPIRITUAL, NHU... OTHERWISE, YOU WOULD NOT BE ATTRACTED BY THIS SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE... YOU WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND YOUR SOUL, YOUR MEMORIES IN A VERY PROFOUND WAY... IT IS NORMAL TO FEEL LIKE AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL SOMETIMES... UNTIL ONE DAY, WE FEEL AT EASE EVERYWHERE WE GO... WE CAN ADAPT TO OTHERS WITH DIPLOMACY AND AFFIRMING OUR SPIRITUAL VALUES THE RIGHT WAY... WE CAN FEEL THE EXCESSIVE NEEDS, THE INNER MONSTERS OF OTHERS WITHOUT BEING DESTABILIZED... BUT HAVING COMPASSION IN OUR HEART... This dream shows that I am facing pressure and difficulties in my work at the social level. I'm hiding a part of myself from the society that I don't want people to know about and it's the blocked, difficult part of me that I need to transform. It is formed by instinctive needs, showing power. People around me noticed something strange about me, but they didn't know about it. And when they realized that I was overwhelmed by these difficulties and blockages, no one could help me. YES, THE DREAM SHOWS WHAT YOU ARE FACING AT THE MOMENT... AND REMEMBER THAT THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE CAN HELP YOU... WHENEVER YOU FEEL THOSE DIFFICULTIES IN YOU, YOU CAN DO THE ANGELIC MANTRA WITH ALL YOUR GOOD INTENTION, THE INTENTION TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON... THE ANGELICA MANTRA WILL REALLY HELP YOU TO TRANSFORM THE EXCESSIVE AND MATERIALISTIC NEEDS THAT CAN EMERGE... YOU ARE DOING A PROFOUND WORK ON YOURSELF NHU. WE HAVE COMPASSION FOR WHAT YOU ARE GOING THROUGH THE DREAM ALSO SHOWS THE MEMORIES OF EXTREME FORCE OF WILL IN ACTION, AND ALSO TOO MUCH USE OF INSTINCTUAL FORCES TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED RESULTS. YOU MUST REMAIN AWARE NOT TO OVER-REACT IN THE STRESSFUL SITUATIONS AS THESE MEMORIES MAY DISTURB YOUR INNER PEACE AS OF NOW. KEEP CHANTING THE ANGELIC MANTRA WHEN YOU GET THE TIME, AND BE LOVING TOWARDS YOURSELF ... YOUR PROFOUND WORK ON YOURSELF WILL HELP YOU GRADUALLY TO ALCHEMISE THESE INNER MONSTERS. If I understand the dream correctly, it is like a dream foreshadowing the difficulties I am facing at work this week. I received this dream at the end of last week and at that time, the difficulties in my work were not clear, and I did not see it as clearly as I do now. I work 2 parallel jobs, and my side job currently takes up a lot of time, making me unable to focus 100% on the main job, it affects my performance and takes up a lot of my time. I feel guilty about this but I can't control it, it just keeps getting worse. And at a climax, I asked my boss for help, recruiting more people and dividing the work, but so far not much has changed. PERFORMANCE IS A NORMAL AND IMPORTANT PARAMETER FOR A COMPANY, BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE THE MAIN PARAMETER... OUR MAIN PARAMETER SHOULD ALWAYS BE A SPIRITUAL PARAMETER... A SPIRITUAL PARAMETER MEANS THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP A SPIRITUAL INTENTION IN WHAT YOU ARE DOING... THE INTENTION TO DEVELOP YOUR QUALITIES WITH LOVE... OTHERWISE, YOU WILL PUT ON YOUR SHOULDERS TOO MUCH PRESSURE, TOO MUCH STRESS BECAUSE OF BEING TOO RESPONSIBLE AND NOT ENOUGH DETACHED... YOU HAVE VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD YOUR DREAM... IT IS GOOD TO SEE HOW MANY EFFORTS YOU ARE PROVIDING TO UNDERSTAND YOURSELF... AND CONCERNING THE HELP ABOUT THE PHYSICAL HEALTH, THE DREAM SHOWS THE INTENSE ENERGY WITHIN, WHICH MIGHT CAUSE HEADACHES... BUT ALSO HOW SOMETIMES YOU CAN REPRESS CERTAIN EXCESSIVE NEEDS, HOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO HIDE IT AND NOT TO FACE IT... AND THE KEY HERE IS THE LOVE YOU CAN DEVELOP WITHIN YOURSELF... THE LOVE OF WORKING ON YOUR MEMORIES, ON DISCOVERING YOUR INNER UNIVERSE WITH WISDOM... ANGELIC CONTINUITY ON THE PATH TO ALCHEMISE THE INNER MONSTERS WITH MANAKEL AND NITH-HAIAH ÂN

title_pdf: 27 Dream - Longtime relatives. last case id: C0201. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 19 November 2021 Angel: 72 Mumiah Dream and Analysis: Hi teachers, ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU This week I have a question that: is the job that I'm planning to move in suitable for my evolution? I, my eldest sister Quynh [- She is short-tempered, imposing, manipulative, aggressive, likes to speak loudly, lack of love, lack of sympathizing ] , and 1 other friend HERE YOU COULD MENTION THE GENDER OF THE PERSON (I don't know this person) went to visit an acquaintance who is a relative that I haven't seen for a long time [- represents that I'm reaching to the old, blocked memories that I need to work on, it also represents parts of me. I have no understanding of these memories so I'm not familiar with it HERE ALSO MENTIONING GENDER COULD GIVE DEEPER UNDERSTANDING AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW THIS RELATIVE, IT MEANS THAT YOU ARE CONNECTING WITH AN UNKNOWN PART OF YOU... YOU ARE MEETING UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES :-) ] (I don't know this relative). I'm digging in my deep memories where I haven't known. These memories are related to lack of love, lack of sympathizing. HERE YOU ARE VISITING SOME DEEP MEMORIES REGARDING YOUR STRUCTURE OF INTIMACY (HOUSE) WHICH WERE UNTOUCHED FOR A LONG TIME... This relative's house is a bit dark, a bit oppressive, and humid [- people with a tendency to hide, be covered by negative emotions, lack of receptivity AND REMEMBER DEAR NHU, THIS HOUSE IS ALSO YOU, WHERE SOMETIMES, YOU ARE ENCOUNTERING FORCES IN YOU THAT CAN MAKE YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE, NOT GOOD IN YOUR EMOTIONS... ] . The house is quite empty, not too many things. A DIFFICULTY TO CREATE A NICE AMBIANCE IN THIS PART OF YOUR INTIMACY, A HOME NEEDS THE BASIC STUFF AND FURNITURE TO HAVE A COMFORTABLE LIFE FOR THE PEOPLE LIVING HERE, SO THIS PART OF YOUR INTIMACY LACKS, AS OF NOW, THE ABILITY TO HAVE INNER STRUCTURE, ABILITY TO HAVE BEAUTIFUL EMOTIONS AND IDEAS AND EMPTINESS IS ALSO THE NOTION OF FEELING THE SOLITUDE... SO YOU SEE HERE HOW THE UNIVERSE IS ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION SO PROFOUNDLY... YOU WOULD LIKE TO MOVE TO ANOTHER JOB BECAUSE IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME YOU CAN FEEL THE SOLITUDE, NOT COMFORTABLE AND TOO EMOTIONAL... BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS OK TO HAVE THE WISH TO IMPROVE YOUR SITUATION... BUT AS YOU UNDERSTAND NOW, EVERYTHING IS A MATTER OF THE INTENTION BUT ALSO THE UNCONSCIOUS INTENTION THAT YOU ARE DISCOVERING IN THIS DREAM... I lie in a hammock [- too much desire to rest, laziness, lack of motivation, over-reception SHOWS THAT YOU LACK THE MOTIVATION TO WORK UPON THIS PART OF INTIMACY WITH RIGOR, AT THE MOMENT, BECAUSE YOU MIGHT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THIS SPACE AS OF NOW. ] , and everyone sits on a chair or the floor SO THERE CAN BE CERTAIN PARTS OF YOU THAT CAN BE TOO DOWN TO EARTH. We talked for quite a while. YOU WERE NOURISHING THIS STATE OF LACK OF LOVE, LACK OF SYMPATHY, TOO DOWN TO EARTH ATTITUDE FOR A LONG TIME, THAT IS WHY YOU MAY, AT PRESENT, FIND IT A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO CONFRONT THESE ASPECTS IN YOU My sister talks mainly, I don't talk too much. But at this moment, I don't feel uncomfortable (because normally, when visiting relatives with my sister, I am quite uncomfortable because I don't know what to say and don't feel familiar). HERE THE DREAMS SHOW THE LAX ATTITUDE IN CLEANSING THIS PART OF THIS INTIMACY, AT THE MOMENT, BECAUSE YOU MAY FEEL A LACK OF ENERGY/MOTIVATION. AND YOU SEE ALSO THAT IT IS SOMETIMES NOT EASY FOR YOU TO COMMUNICATE WHERE YOU ARE IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR SOCIAL INTIMACY... YOU SEE THAT YOUR INNER SISTER REPRESENTS ALSO SOMEONE WHO LIKES TO TALK LOUDLY, SO IT MEANS THAT YOU CAN HAVE RESONANCE WITH THAT ASPECT AND BY A MECHANISM OF COMPENSATION, YOU, SOMETIMES PREFER NOT TO SPEAK... WOW... IT IS SO PROFOUND TO UNDERSTAND THAT... AND REMEMBER THAT THIS DREAM IS A PERCENTAGE OF YOU... YOU HAVE A GREAT POTENTIAL IN YOU, DEAR NHU I lack of communication with these parts of me, I tend to hide these memories because they are related to negative emotions. YES BECAUSE IN PAST YOU HAD CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES TO COMMUNICATE PROFOUNDLY (INNER SISTER) WITH THESE PARTS OF YOU. WHEN YOU BANALIZE THE NEGATIVE MEMORIES IN YOU, YOU MAY SOMETIMES ACT WITH YOUR INNER SISTER'S ENERGY OR YOU CAN RESONATE WITH THAT KIND OF ENERGY... After that, this relative saw us off [- represents the end, transition to a new state ] . Our motorbikes are left in another place (because there is no parking space in the house). NOTION OF DIFFICULTIES WITH THE RECEPTIVITY (PARKING)... The way out was empty of people, it was quite dark. AND WHEN YOU HAVE DIFFICULTIES TO CONNECT WITH YOUR SOCIAL INTIMACY, YOU SEE A DEEPER DIFFICULTIES IN THE SOCIAL LEVEL... SOCIAL LEVEL MEANS THAT MORE MEMORIES ARE INVOLVED COMPARED TO THE SOCIAL INTIMACY... YOU CAN FEEL SOMETIMES ALONE, AND NOT UNDERSTOOD BY OTHERS BECAUSE OF THIS DIFFICULTY TO COMMUNICATE WELL... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... On the walk, there was a house that was also an acquaintance of ours. The relative was asking if we wanted to visit them. We didn't have time to answer when we arrived at the door of that acquaintance's house. HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE DIFFICULTY TO BE WELL RECEPTIVE (NO PARKING SPACE IN THE HOUSE) CREATES THE NOTION OF BEING TOO EMISSIVE SINCE YOU DID NOT HAVE TIME TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF YOUR INNER RELATIVE... IT IS LIKE YOU CAN MAKE DECISIONS TOO FAST... SO IT IS ANOTHER INVITATION NOT TO CHANGE YOUR JOB TOO FAST... BUT TO THINK ABOUT THE MEMORIES THAT YOU ARE MEETING, TO MEDITATE, AND TO TRANSFORM THEM WITH ALL THE LOVE AND WISDOM YOU HAVE WITHIN YOU AND WHEN YOU FEEL THE NATURAL MOVEMENT OF THE UNIVERSE WHILE YOU ARE RECEPTIVE, UP ABOVE WILL GIVE YOU THE GREEN LIGHT TO CHANGE THE JOB I am slowly understanding negative memories in order to transform them, prepare to be able to accept new things and a new state. In the process, it was quite dark, but I did see the light needed (second relative's house) HERE YOU CAN COMPLETE THE UNDERSTANDING WITH COMMENTS ABOVE, DEAR NHU... The house of this acquaintance has very bright lights and a cozy feeling [+ Illumination, good memories related to family, full of love IT COULD HAVE BEEN POSITIVE BUT SINCE THE AMBIANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DREAM WAS NOT VERY GOOD, IT WILL TINT NEGATIVELY YOUR DREAM... BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT SHOWS YOUR WISH TO CREATE A GOOD AMBIANCE IN YOU... TO BE ABLE TO BRING LIGHT, TO BRING KNOWLEDGE IN YOUR INNER STRUCTURE (HOUSE)... ] . This house is open on 2 fronts. NUMBER 2 IS RELATED TO PARTNERSHIP, RELATIONSHIP, SO YOU ARE GRADUALLY PREPARING TO UNDERSTAND THE RIGHT DYNAMICS IN A PARTNERSHIP, RELATIONSHIP, I.E WHEN YOU ARE RELATING TO SOMEONE, IT CAN EVEN BE YOUR SISTER . In the house, there is the sound of the TV on and children playing. This house is preparing dinner. So the 4 of us walked in. This is also a house of a longtime acquaintance. My sister and I feel uncomfortable when talking, because we are not very close. And people just have small talk. THIS INNER STRUCTURE IN YOU IS IN PREPARATION. YOU SEE THAT WHEN THE AMBIANCE IS BETTER, YOU ARE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR INNER SISTER, WITH YOURSELF EVEN IF YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE... BUT WHAT IS GOOD HERE, IS THAT YOU CAN COMMUNICATE... BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU SEE THAT YOU ARE ENTERING IN A HOUSE WHERE YOU WERE NOT REALLY INVITED... IT IS LIKE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU FEEL THAT THE AMBIANCE IS VERY GOOD SOMEWHERE, YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE PART OF THAT HOUSE... AND AT THE SAME TIME, YOU ARE PROGRESSIVELY BUILDING YOUR INNER HOUSE WITH A COZY FEELING, WITH THE FEELING OF REGENERATION INSIDE :-)... AND ONE DAY, YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR INNER HOUSE SO THAT YOU WILL ALWAYS FEEL AT HOME WHEREVER YOU GO... THIS DREAM IS ALSO AN INVITATION TO TRANSCEND THE INNER FIRST RELATIVE ENERGY AND INNER SISTER ENERGY IN YOU. AND ALSO WORK UPON THE LAXITY THAT YOU MAY SOMETIMES FEEL IN WORKING UPON THE INNER MINUSES AND YOU MAY NOURISH THEM MORE BY BEING ALOOF AND INDIFFERENT TOWARDS THESE MEMORIES. AND AT THE SAME TIME, WE KNOW THAT YOU HAVE THIS CAPACITY TO TRANSFORM THESE MEMORIES... YOU SEE THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A JOB THAT CAN MAKE YOU FEEL AT HOME, A BEAUTIFUL HOME LIKE A FAMILY... THIS IS THE ENERGY THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AND THAT YOU CAN BUILD FROM INSIDE FIRST... The dream shows that I am gradually transforming the memories related to the lack of love, lack of sympathizing, I am on the right path. However, I need to work more to understand and receive this light gradually become familiar to me, now it is strange. YOU ARE INDEED ON THE RIGHT PATH, DEAR NHU. FOR YOU TO REACH THAT INNER INTIMACY THAT IS COZY, COMFORTABLE, FULL OF LIGHT, YOU KEEP ON WORKING ON YOURSELF WITH THIS VIGOR. AND IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO TAKE CARE OF CERTAIN STRUCTURES OF YOUR INTIMACY WHERE YOU CAN FEEL OPPRESSED, TOO EMOTIONAL, NOT AT EASE WITH YOUR EMOTIONS IN THE SOCIAL INTIMACY...

    "dream_text": "I, my eldest sister Quynh [- She is short-tempered, imposing, manipulative, aggressive, likes to speak loudly, lack of love, lack of sympathizing ] , and 1 other friend HERE YOU COULD MENTION THE GENDER OF THE PERSON (I don't know this person) went to visit an acquaintance who is a relative that I haven't seen for a long time [- represents that I'm reaching to the old, blocked memories that I need to work on, it also represents parts of me. I have no understanding of these memories so I'm not familiar with it HERE ALSO MENTIONING GENDER COULD GIVE DEEPER UNDERSTANDING AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW THIS RELATIVE, IT MEANS THAT YOU ARE CONNECTING WITH AN UNKNOWN PART OF YOU... YOU ARE MEETING UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES :-) ] (I don't know this relative). I'm digging in my deep memories where I haven't known. These memories are related to lack of love, lack of sympathizing. HERE YOU ARE VISITING SOME DEEP MEMORIES REGARDING YOUR STRUCTURE OF INTIMACY (HOUSE) WHICH WERE UNTOUCHED FOR A LONG TIME... This relative's house is a bit dark, a bit oppressive, and humid [- people with a tendency to hide, be covered by negative emotions, lack of receptivity AND REMEMBER DEAR NHU, THIS HOUSE IS ALSO YOU, WHERE SOMETIMES, YOU ARE ENCOUNTERING FORCES IN YOU THAT CAN MAKE YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE, NOT GOOD IN YOUR EMOTIONS... ] . The house is quite empty, not too many things. A DIFFICULTY TO CREATE A NICE AMBIANCE IN THIS PART OF YOUR INTIMACY, A HOME NEEDS THE BASIC STUFF AND FURNITURE TO HAVE A COMFORTABLE LIFE FOR THE PEOPLE LIVING HERE, SO THIS PART OF YOUR INTIMACY LACKS, AS OF NOW, THE ABILITY TO HAVE INNER STRUCTURE, ABILITY TO HAVE BEAUTIFUL EMOTIONS AND IDEAS AND EMPTINESS IS ALSO THE NOTION OF FEELING THE SOLITUDE... SO YOU SEE HERE HOW THE UNIVERSE IS ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION SO PROFOUNDLY... YOU WOULD LIKE TO MOVE TO ANOTHER JOB BECAUSE IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME YOU CAN FEEL THE SOLITUDE, NOT COMFORTABLE AND TOO EMOTIONAL... BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS OK TO HAVE THE WISH TO IMPROVE YOUR SITUATION... BUT AS YOU UNDERSTAND NOW, EVERYTHING IS A MATTER OF THE INTENTION BUT ALSO THE UNCONSCIOUS INTENTION THAT YOU ARE DISCOVERING IN THIS DREAM... I lie in a hammock [- too much desire to rest, laziness, lack of motivation, over-reception SHOWS THAT YOU LACK THE MOTIVATION TO WORK UPON THIS PART OF INTIMACY WITH RIGOR, AT THE MOMENT, BECAUSE YOU MIGHT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THIS SPACE AS OF NOW. ] , and everyone sits on a chair or the floor SO THERE CAN BE CERTAIN PARTS OF YOU THAT CAN BE TOO DOWN TO EARTH. We talked for quite a while. YOU WERE NOURISHING THIS STATE OF LACK OF LOVE, LACK OF SYMPATHY, TOO DOWN TO EARTH ATTITUDE FOR A LONG TIME, THAT IS WHY YOU MAY, AT PRESENT, FIND IT A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO CONFRONT THESE ASPECTS IN YOU My sister talks mainly, I don't talk too much. But at this moment, I don't feel uncomfortable (because normally, when visiting relatives with my sister, I am quite uncomfortable because I don't know what to say and don't feel familiar). HERE THE DREAMS SHOW THE LAX ATTITUDE IN CLEANSING THIS PART OF THIS INTIMACY, AT THE MOMENT, BECAUSE YOU MAY FEEL A LACK OF ENERGY/MOTIVATION. AND YOU SEE ALSO THAT IT IS SOMETIMES NOT EASY FOR YOU TO COMMUNICATE WHERE YOU ARE IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR SOCIAL INTIMACY... YOU SEE THAT YOUR INNER SISTER REPRESENTS ALSO SOMEONE WHO LIKES TO TALK LOUDLY, SO IT MEANS THAT YOU CAN HAVE RESONANCE WITH THAT ASPECT AND BY A MECHANISM OF COMPENSATION, YOU, SOMETIMES PREFER NOT TO SPEAK... WOW... IT IS SO PROFOUND TO UNDERSTAND THAT... AND REMEMBER THAT THIS DREAM IS A PERCENTAGE OF YOU... YOU HAVE A GREAT POTENTIAL IN YOU, DEAR NHU I lack of communication with these parts of me, I tend to hide these memories because they are related to negative emotions. YES BECAUSE IN PAST YOU HAD CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES TO COMMUNICATE PROFOUNDLY (INNER SISTER) WITH THESE PARTS OF YOU. WHEN YOU BANALIZE THE NEGATIVE MEMORIES IN YOU, YOU MAY SOMETIMES ACT WITH YOUR INNER SISTER'S ENERGY OR YOU CAN RESONATE WITH THAT KIND OF ENERGY... After that, this relative saw us off [- represents the end, transition to a new state ] . Our motorbikes are left in another place (because there is no parking space in the house). NOTION OF DIFFICULTIES WITH THE RECEPTIVITY (PARKING)... The way out was empty of people, it was quite dark. AND WHEN YOU HAVE DIFFICULTIES TO CONNECT WITH YOUR SOCIAL INTIMACY, YOU SEE A DEEPER DIFFICULTIES IN THE SOCIAL LEVEL... SOCIAL LEVEL MEANS THAT MORE MEMORIES ARE INVOLVED COMPARED TO THE SOCIAL INTIMACY... YOU CAN FEEL SOMETIMES ALONE, AND NOT UNDERSTOOD BY OTHERS BECAUSE OF THIS DIFFICULTY TO COMMUNICATE WELL... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... On the walk, there was a house that was also an acquaintance of ours. The relative was asking if we wanted to visit them. We didn't have time to answer when we arrived at the door of that acquaintance's house. HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE DIFFICULTY TO BE WELL RECEPTIVE (NO PARKING SPACE IN THE HOUSE) CREATES THE NOTION OF BEING TOO EMISSIVE SINCE YOU DID NOT HAVE TIME TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF YOUR INNER RELATIVE... IT IS LIKE YOU CAN MAKE DECISIONS TOO FAST... SO IT IS ANOTHER INVITATION NOT TO CHANGE YOUR JOB TOO FAST... BUT TO THINK ABOUT THE MEMORIES THAT YOU ARE MEETING, TO MEDITATE, AND TO TRANSFORM THEM WITH ALL THE LOVE AND WISDOM YOU HAVE WITHIN YOU AND WHEN YOU FEEL THE NATURAL MOVEMENT OF THE UNIVERSE WHILE YOU ARE RECEPTIVE, UP ABOVE WILL GIVE YOU THE GREEN LIGHT TO CHANGE THE JOB I am slowly understanding negative memories in order to transform them, prepare to be able to accept new things and a new state. In the process, it was quite dark, but I did see the light needed (second relative's house) HERE YOU CAN COMPLETE THE UNDERSTANDING WITH COMMENTS ABOVE, DEAR NHU... The house of this acquaintance has very bright lights and a cozy feeling [+ Illumination, good memories related to family, full of love IT COULD HAVE BEEN POSITIVE BUT SINCE THE AMBIANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DREAM WAS NOT VERY GOOD, IT WILL TINT NEGATIVELY YOUR DREAM... BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT SHOWS YOUR WISH TO CREATE A GOOD AMBIANCE IN YOU... TO BE ABLE TO BRING LIGHT, TO BRING KNOWLEDGE IN YOUR INNER STRUCTURE (HOUSE)... ] . This house is open on 2 fronts. NUMBER 2 IS RELATED TO PARTNERSHIP, RELATIONSHIP, SO YOU ARE GRADUALLY PREPARING TO UNDERSTAND THE RIGHT DYNAMICS IN A PARTNERSHIP, RELATIONSHIP, I.E WHEN YOU ARE RELATING TO SOMEONE, IT CAN EVEN BE YOUR SISTER . In the house, there is the sound of the TV on and children playing. This house is preparing dinner. So the 4 of us walked in. This is also a house of a longtime acquaintance. My sister and I feel uncomfortable when talking, because we are not very close. And people just have small talk. THIS INNER STRUCTURE IN YOU IS IN PREPARATION. YOU SEE THAT WHEN THE AMBIANCE IS BETTER, YOU ARE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR INNER SISTER, WITH YOURSELF EVEN IF YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE... BUT WHAT IS GOOD HERE, IS THAT YOU CAN COMMUNICATE... BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU SEE THAT YOU ARE ENTERING IN A HOUSE WHERE YOU WERE NOT REALLY INVITED... IT IS LIKE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU FEEL THAT THE AMBIANCE IS VERY GOOD SOMEWHERE, YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE PART OF THAT HOUSE... AND AT THE SAME TIME, YOU ARE PROGRESSIVELY BUILDING YOUR INNER HOUSE WITH A COZY FEELING, WITH THE FEELING OF REGENERATION INSIDE :-)... AND ONE DAY, YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR INNER HOUSE SO THAT YOU WILL ALWAYS FEEL AT HOME WHEREVER YOU GO... THIS DREAM IS ALSO AN INVITATION TO TRANSCEND THE INNER FIRST RELATIVE ENERGY AND INNER SISTER ENERGY IN YOU. AND ALSO WORK UPON THE LAXITY THAT YOU MAY SOMETIMES FEEL IN WORKING UPON THE INNER MINUSES AND YOU MAY NOURISH THEM MORE BY BEING ALOOF AND INDIFFERENT TOWARDS THESE MEMORIES. AND AT THE SAME TIME, WE KNOW THAT YOU HAVE THIS CAPACITY TO TRANSFORM THESE MEMORIES... YOU SEE THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A JOB THAT CAN MAKE YOU FEEL AT HOME, A BEAUTIFUL HOME LIKE A FAMILY... THIS IS THE ENERGY THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AND THAT YOU CAN BUILD FROM INSIDE FIRST... The dream shows that I am gradually transforming the memories related to the lack of love, lack of sympathizing, I am on the right path. However, I need to work more to understand and receive this light gradually become familiar to me, now it is strange. YOU ARE INDEED ON THE RIGHT PATH, DEAR NHU. FOR YOU TO REACH THAT INNER INTIMACY THAT IS COZY, COMFORTABLE, FULL OF LIGHT, YOU KEEP ON WORKING ON YOURSELF WITH THIS VIGOR. AND IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO TAKE CARE OF CERTAIN STRUCTURES OF YOUR INTIMACY WHERE YOU CAN FEEL OPPRESSED, TOO EMOTIONAL, NOT AT EASE WITH YOUR EMOTIONS IN THE SOCIAL INTIMACY... IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT NOT TO BE TOO LAZY IN YOUR INNER WORK (HAMMOCK) AND AS YOU KNOW THIS LAZINESS COMES BECOME OF BEING SOMETIMES TOO PERFECTIONIST, TOO INTENSE... AND LAZINESS BECOMES A COMPENSATION FOR THE EXCESS OF WILLPOWER... EVERYTHING IS A QUESTION OF BALANCE, EQUILIBRIUM...",

title_pdf: 28 Dream - The important leader returns. last case id: C0202. PDF text: Dream date: Thursday, 25 November 2021 Angel: 72 Mumiah Dream and Analysis: Hi teachers, ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU This week, my question: Has my journey with my current main job been accomplished? (my intention is to whether I should change work) IT'S A NICE PRACTICE TO ASK SUCH QUESTION AND ASK FOR GUIDANCE FROM UP ABOVE :-) I went on a business trip to a far away place, place was like old Europe [- Minuses of Europe are too many needs, abuse of power, violence, repression, aggression. Old shows that I'm visiting old memories associated with these distortions HERE IT SHOWS THE MEMORIES RELATED TO EXCHANGES IN THE COLLECTIVE LEVEL , SINCE IT IS A BUSINESS TRIP IT REPRESENTS HOW YOU CAN SOMETIMES ACT OUT OF TOO MANY NEEDS, ETC. AND EUROPE IS ALSO THE NOTION OF OLD SOUL, BEING TOO COMPLICATED, CONSCIOUSNESS ASLEEP BY THE EXCESSES OF SATISFACTION OF THE NEEDS... AND SINCE IT IS FAR AWAY, IT MEANS THAT YOU ARE DISCOVERING VERY OLD MEMORIES THAT YOU ARE NOT USED TO FACE... ] There is a big party [- wastefulness, excessive rest, too many needs, superficiality ] that will be held. There are quite a few famous people, leaders [- abuse of power, imposition, authoritarianism ] in organization who will come THEY ALSO REPRESENT YOUR INNER LEADER, YOUR CAPACITY OF DECISIONS.... Because a very important person is coming back from far away [- This important person can have great merit and influence in organization. He likes a guide and takes the organization forward. And he needs to go far to grow. From here, it can be seen that this person is very excellent. However, he can resonate with loneliness, aloneness, lack of social connection, like to grow, work independently BUT REMEMBER THIS "VERY IMPORTANT PERSON" IS ALSO YOU... AND HERE YOU SEE THE NOTION OF WANTING TO BE IMPORTANT IN THE EYES OF OTHERS... TO HAVE RECOGNITION ON A VERY LARGE SCALE... AND THIS IS INDEED A HUMAN DISTORTION THAT MOST OF THE HUMANS ARE SHARING ALTOGETHER... MOST OF THE PEOPLE WORK TO HAVE RECOGNITION, TO FEEL LIKE PART OF A FAMILY, TO BE APPRECIATED BY OTHERS... ] . They hold this party to welcome this person. It shows that everyone respects and looks forward to that person's return. THE BEGINNING OF THE DREAM COULD HAVE BEEN POSITIVE... BUT AS THE SECOND SCENE IS MORE NEGATIVE, IT WILL TINT NEGATIVELY THE FIRST SCENE... AND IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND MORE IN-DEPTH THIS NOTION OF BUSINESS TRIP :-)... IT IS THE MAIN THEME OF YOUR DREAM WHICH IS RELATED TO THE COLLECTIVE EXCHANGE, BEING ABLE TO EXPAND YOUR QUALITIES IN MATTER (BUSINESS) BUT HERE IT SHOWS MORE A DIFFICULTY TO EXPAND IN MATTER, TO INTEGRATE THE QUALITIES OF YOUR INNER EUROPE BECAUSE OF THE MEMORIES YOU ARE SHOWN ABOVE... HAVING TOO MANY NEEDS, DIFFICULTY WITH AUTHORITY, NEEDS FOR RECOGNITION, ETC. THAT BEING SAID, DEAR NHU, YOU HAVE SUCH PROFOUND QUALITIES... AND THIS DREAM IS HERE TO HELP YOU TO DISCOVER VERY OLD MEMORIES... SO AS TO IMPROVE YOUR LIFE AND CREATE AN ANGELIC FUTURE ... I am slowly exploring memories of abuse of power, preferring to be alone, preferring to work independently, being violent when I have intentions related to work. Here it shows, in my main work, I have activated these distortions and I am slowly transforming them in right way (party) HERE THE PARTY DOES NOT MENTION A TRANSFORMATION BUT THE NEED TO CONNECT WITH THE SOCIAL AND COLLECTIVE LEVEL... TO LIVE AN EXPANSION IN MATTER (BUSINESS TRIP) AND TO FEEL RELAX, TO FEEL CONNECTED WITH OTHERS AT THE SAME TIME (PARTY)... THE DREAM HERE SHOWS, WHEN YOU OPERATE WITH THE INFLUENCE OF INNER EUROPE ENERGY, YOU MAY SOMETIMES AND IN CERTAIN % BANALISE THE POWER PLAY IN YOU AND MAY ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSTINCTUAL FORCES IN YOU... IT MEANS THAT YOU CAN, SOMETIMES AND IN A PERCENTAGE, ATTRACT PEOPLE WHO CAN BE TOO COMPLICATED OR BEING TOO COMPLICATED, HAVING DUALITIES WHETHER YOU SHOULD CONTINUE YOUR WORK OR NOT, NOT KNOWING WHAT TO CHOOSE BECAUSE OF INSECURITIES, NEEDS, ETC. IT IS VERY INTERESTING THAT THE QUESTION RELATED TO CHANGING A JOB IS SHOWING YOU THE INNER EUROPE... YOU SEE THAT THE DUALITIES, THE DIFFICULTIES THAT YOU ARE LIVING IN YOUR CURRENT JOB IS NOT REALLY BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT JOB BUT BECAUSE OF VERY OLD MEMORIES...WOW... YOU ARE BLESSED TO SEE THAT IN DREAM One night, I shared a room [- share space of intimacy. Minuses are too open, too easy YES... TOO INTIMATE TOO FAST ] with a middle- aged man [- imbalance between 2 polarities, too much emission. TOO MUCH CONNECTION WITH A PART OF YOUR MASCULINE POLARITY... AND THIS SCENE IS SHOWING YOU HOW THE COMPLICATED NEEDS (EUROPE) ARE ALSO MIXED WITH THE NEED FOR LOVE, THE NEED TO CONNECT YOUR INTIMACY WITH OTHER PEOPLE ] . THESE ARE THE MEMORIES RELATED TO BEING TOO OPEN AND CASUAL IN THE COLLECTIVE. SHARING YOUR INTIMACY /ROOM WITH SOMEONE ON A BUSINESS TRIP IS NOT RIGHT HERE...This person is my partner. We are prepared to work together. He and I shared a bed (white bed sheet), but we were quite respectful of each other. EVEN IF IT WAS QUITE RESPECTFUL IN THE DREAM, YOU ARE SHOWN THE NEEDS OF RECOGNITION (FAMOUS PEOPLE, VERY IMPORTANT PERSON AS SHOWN ABOVE), THE NEED FOR LOVE CAN BE IMPORTANT AND CREATE THE NOTION OF CREATING TOO MUCH PROXIMITY... AND THE WORK BECOMES LIKE AN EXCUSE TO MAKE YOU CLOSER, TO CONNECT WITH SOMEONE WHO WAS THE POSSIBILITY TO ATTRACT YOU... We just talk about work. I began to open up and share some intimate things with outside world, with some new people, also with a part of myself. I share slowly and tactfully, but there is still a degree of danger (since there is nothing to protect). Here I can only rely on the attitude of middle-aged man. This man is quite tactful, reasonable, so he behaves very properly. AND REMEMBER THIS MAN IT IS ALSO YOU... YOU SEE THE QUALITIES OF RESPECT IN YOU... BUT IT IS NEEDED TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO CREATE TOO MUCH INTIMACY WHILE YOU ARE WORKING WITH OTHERS BECAUSE THE TOO MUCH ASPECT CAN EVENTUALLY CREATE REJECTION - WANTING TO BE ALONE... AND REMEMBER THAT THIS DREAM WAS ABOUT THE "BUSINESS TRIP" WHICH IS RELATED TO YOUR CAPACITY TO EXPAND IN MATTER BECAUSE BEHIND, IN THE INTIMATE LEVEL, YOU SEE A PERCENTAGE WHERE YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE LOVED, TO APPRECIATED BY OTHERS... AND THE KEY TO TRANSFORM THOSE MEMORIES IS TO DEVELOP SELF-COMPASSION, SELF-RECOGNITION, BEING ABLE TO SEE YOUR PROFOUND QUALITIES, HAVING IN YOUR INTENTION TO DEVELOP YOUR QUALITIES, TO BECOME A BETTER SOUL... AND THE ANGELIC MANTRA CAN HELP YOU TO FOCUS YOUR INTENTION SO AS TO TRANSFORM YOUR MEMORIES IN-DEPTH... After a while, he said he felt overwhelmed, he said he would lower temperature of air conditioner [- air conditioner is related to the air, representing thought. It shows a decrease in frequency of thoughts, more focused on present because maybe thinking too much AND LOWER THE TEMPERATURE MEANS THAT WHEN YOU FEEL TOO MUCH INTIMACY, PROXIMITY, IN YOUR CONCRETE ACTION (MASCULINE POLARITY), YOU CAN BECOME COLDER IN YOUR ENERGY... IT IS A REACTION, A COMPENSATION FOR BEING TOO FAST IN THE RELATIONAL LEVEL... ] , I agreed. He turns it down quite low, about 20 degrees, but then he turns it up again to about 28 - 29 degrees. I asked him why he only adjusted 1 - 2 degrees lower than before, he said that it was enough. After that, he and I continued to discuss work. AND YOU SEE IN THE RELATIONAL LEVEL HOW YOU CAN IMPOSE THE AMBIANCE, THE INNER AND OUTER TEMPERATURE BECAUSE THIS PART OF YOU IS NOT ASKING YOUR POINT OF VIEW... AND THE TEMPERATURE IS A SYMBOL THAT IS RELATED TO BEING ABLE TO CREATE REFRESHING AND INVIGORATING THOUGHTS (LOWER TEMPERATURE) OR WARM THOUGHTS OF LOVE (HIGHER TEMPERATURE) FOR PARTS OF YOU... WE CAN SEE ALSO THAT LOWERING THE TEMPERATURE AND THEN INCREASING IT AGAIN, SHOWS THE DUALITIES IN THE EMISSIVE ASPECT OF YOU. YOU SEE ALSO THE NOTION OF OLD EUROPE, WHERE IT BECOMES COMPLICATED... TRYING TO FIND THE PERFECT TEMPERATURE, THE PERFECT ENVIRONMENT THAT FITS THE OLD SOUL... BUT HAVING FRUSTRATION WHEN NOT HAVING THE PERFECTION... SO IT IS ANOTHER PROFOUND MESSAGE FOR YOUR SOUL DEAR NHU... WHEN WE WORK, THE JOB IS INDEED IMPORTANT BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT IS TO EVOLVE AND TO CLEANSE OUR MEMORIES... BECAUSE IT IS THE NEGATIVE MEMORIES THAT CREATE THE HEAVINESS, THE LAZINESS, AND ALL KINDS OF DISTORTIONS... UP ABOVE CAN GIVE YOU THE BEST JOB YOU CAN IMAGINE, BUT IF THE NEGATIVE MEMORIES ARE STILL THERE, YOU WILL NOT FEEL GOOD EITHER... This man understands me quite wellm was able to balance qualities, needs of me and him. This man represents the balance of 2 polarities in me. I was able to reframe my thoughts and be more realistic. HERE IT IS THE NEGATIVE ASPECT, DEAR NHU... YOU CAN COMPLETE THE UNDERSTAND WITH THE COMMENTS ABOVE... :-) I feel this is a good, positive (blue) dream. If from my question with angel Mumiah on these 2 weeks, I can interpret this dream as a confirm dream: in my new job, I will meet a good leader who understands me, can help me balance 2 polarities, improve the distortions (middle man). NHU, THE DREAM IS NOT GIVING THE ANSWER HERE, RATHER IT SHOWS WHICH MEMORIES YOU MAY WORK UPON MORE, SO AS TO GET THE CLARITY IN THE FUTURE. YOU CAN FOCUS TO WORK UPON THE MEMORIES RELATED TO INNER OLD EUROPE, INNER LEADER, AND INNER MIDDLE AGE MAN... 23/07/2025, 11:20 The important leader returns | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/90364 2/4 YOU MUST BE AWARE AT THE WORKPLACE AND IN SOCIAL LIFE, AS TO HOW MUCH SPACE YOU GIVE TO OTHERS IN YOUR INTIMACY AND ALSO HOW MUCH YOU ENTER/INTRUDE INTO THE INTIMACY OF OTHERS KEEPING THE FACADE OF PROFESSIONALISM.....YOU CAN RELATE IT TO THE TIME WHEN YOU TRIED TO TALK ABOUT WORK WITH A FEMALE COLLEAGUE, HAN, IN THE CAFE... ALSO WHEN A FRIEND OF YOUR'S, TUAN, INVITED YOU TO SLEEP IN THE SAME ROOM. SO THERE IS A DIFFICULTY WITH BALANCING THE EMOTIONS BECAUSE OF THE INNER LACKS WHICH WHEN NOT RESOLVED FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME CAN CREATE A BEHAVIOR THAT IS TOO EMISSIVE, FAST AND NOT WELL-BALANCED... Symbol of "part" shows that my journey with my current main job has come to an end, congratulates me. YOU ARE INDEED A PROFOUND WORK ON YOURSELF NHU... BUT THIS DREAM IS SHOWING YOU MEMORIES SO AS TO IMPROVE YOUR LIFE, SO AS TO IMPROVE YOUR INTENTION WHILE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ANOTHER JOB :-)... This week I have been having dreams about murder/kill others repeatedly while chanting with question above. As I understand, I am working with old memories, transforming them gradually, killing represents for old memories were activated. At the same time, I also had a conversation with a close friend, but after that talk, I felt like I was running out of energy, my body was very weak (like I gave my energy to she or she sucked it up of mine). YOU CAN LOOK INTO YOUR RESONANCES WITH THIS FRIEND. YOU MAKE FEEL DRAINED BECAUSE OF SOME MEMORIES GETTING TRIGGERED IN YOU BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS BEING DISCUSSED. FOR E.G SOME CONVERSATIONS CAN INDUCE FEAR OR ANXIETY AND ONE MAY FEEL DRAINED OF ENERGY BECAUSE OF THAT. A lot of negative events, dreams, signs happened, but finally, I received this dream which shows that I am slowly transforming my distortions to get correct answer with my evolution. Do I understand this right? YOU ARE SURELY TRANSFORMING NEGATIVE MEMORIES... THAT IS FOR SURE... BUT THOSE DREAMS ABOUT MURDER AND KILLING SHOW THAT YOU ARE REPRESSING CERTAIN MEMORIES THAT YOU HAVE DIFFICULTIES FACING... AT TIMES... IT SHOWS ALSO THAT WHEN YOU HAVE DIFFICULTIES, YOU PREFER SOMETIMES NOT TO SEE THAT... AND THIS DREAM IS SHOWING YOU HOW YOU CAN COMPENSATE BY BEING MORE IN MATTER, WANTING TO SATISFY THE NEEDS FOR MATTER, FOR FAME, FOR COLLECTIVE RECOGNITION (FAMOUS PEOPLE + BUSINESS TRIP, ETC.)... AND FINALLY, AT THE END, IT SHOWS THE ROOT CAUSE THAT IS THE NEED FOR LOVE... REMEMBER DEAR NHU, YOU ARE ALREADY DOING A GOOD WORK ON YOURSELF... THIS DREAM IS SHOWING YOU SUBTLE AND PROFOUND MEMORIES... UP ABOVE UNVEILS IMPORTANT AND OLD MEMORIES SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION IN YOUR LIFE A few weeks ago, I listened to Mr. An and went to hospital about my low blood pressure. And a few unexpected things happened to me. I went to Binh Thanh hospital. When I entered hospital, the staff informed me that my insurance card has expired, cannot be used. I was confused, they sent me information they exported from system, I found it to be slow to update, so I reported it to company. The company told me that this information was managed by the Ministry of Health so they couldn't process it right away, and in the end, I decided to do it without insurance. When I checked with doctor, doctor measured my blood pressure twice and said that my blood pressure readings are completely normal, no problems at all. I was surprised because that morning I still hadn't eaten anything to keep my body intact, went to doctor. I shared my symptoms, doctor just said that she did not detect my disease and gave me tonics to drink. I found it quite absurd, so next day, I continued to go to another hospital that I usually go to first. When measuring my blood pressure, doctor found that my blood pressure was low and asked me to do some tests on my heart, carotid arteries. I went to check all of them according to doctor's instructions, then she read results: I don't have low blood pressure, results are good and there is no cause for blood pressure. I was surprised again, continued to tell all my symptoms, especially emphasizing fact that I always felt cold in my head and inside my body, doctor reassured me and said that it could be due to a temporary psychological effect or because of atopic, cause blood pressure to be a bit low. And she also gave me tonics too. I was completely surprised by results of all examinations, at that time I was really having a headache, cold inside, I was hoping I could be given some medicine to relieve this pain, even temporarily. However, things were not quite what I expected. After that, I just took medicine for a few days, changed to angel Habuhiah to heal. Now after about 3 weeks, I am much better and pain is much less. I wonder if my illness can be only felt and understood on a spiritual level, but cannot find a cause to cure on a physical level? FIRST OF ALL CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU FOR YOUR HEALTHY REPORTS... IT SHOWS DEAR NHU, THAT THESE ARE THE INNER DUALITIES AND THE INNER CONFLICTS WHICH CAUSE THE DISCREPANCIES IN YOUR ENERGY THEREBY INDUCING PAIN OR HEADACHE... AS YOU KEEP WORKING UPON THESE DUALITIES IN YOU, AND WITH THE PROFOUND WORK THAT YOU DO ON YOURSELF, YOU WILL GRADUALLY IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH... AND REMEMBER THAT THE SPIRITUAL LEVEL IS THE BEGINNING OF EVERYTHING... EVERYTHING STARTS IN THE SPIRITUAL LEVEL... SO WHEN YOU ARE GOING INTO THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE MEMORIES, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO HEAL YOUR SOUL SO PROFOUNDLY... IT IS NOT JUST ABSTRACT TO UNDERSTAND AND HEAL YOUR MEMORIES... IT CORRESPONDS TO THE MOST PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE YOU CAN PROVIDE FOR YOUR SOUL... AND YOU SEE THOSE 2 DOCTORS AS A PART OF YOU THAT YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED THROUGH THE LAW OF RESONANCE... BOTH OF THEM WERE GIVING YOU A "TONIC", WHICH MEANS SOMETHING TO BOOST YOU... IT IS LIKE A BOOST OF OVER-EMISSIVITY IN A WAY... AND AS YOU HAVE DISCOVERED IN YOUR DREAMS, IT IS LIKE SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE SO PERFECTIONIST, DOING THINGS SO PERFECTLY (TONIC BOOST) VERSUS HAVING EPISODES OF LAZINESS, NOT WANTING TO MATERIALIZE, ETC. SO IT IS AN INVITATION FROM UP ABOVE TO DEVELOP DEEP RECEPTIVITY FILLED WITH LOVE, TO INTERIORIZE, TO ENTER IN YOUR INNER WORLD SO AS TO DEVELOP LOVE AND RECOGNITION FROM INSIDE... SO THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO COMPENSATE IN MATTER, IN BUSINESS TRIP, OR AFFECTIVE RELATIONSHIP LIKE IN THE DREAM... YOU WILL BE ABLE TO CREATE THE WARMTH, THE LOVE FROM INSIDE AND IT WILL GRADUALLY TRANSFORM THE COLDNESS... WE BELIEVE IN YOU, DEAR NHU... YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT PATH OF TRANSFORMATION ANGELIC HEALING OF YOUR INNER SELF WITH MELAHEL 23/07/2025, 11:20 The important leader returns | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/90364 3/4 ÂN

title_pdf: 29 Dream - ask right time. last case id: C0203. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 3 December 2021 Angel: 21 Nelkhael Dream and Analysis: Hi teachers, ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU This week, I have a question to continue my intention of work: when is the right time to change my job? LET SEE WHAT UP ABOVE ANSWERED :-) My company organizes outings. Everyone has to get 2 injections of the vaccine [- vaccine represents self-protection, creating resistance. Minuses are overprotection, denial, lack of receptivity, lack of understanding, lack of understanding of the law of resonance, karma. The number 2 represents the relationship. This means in the relationship, I lack understanding and have a certain resistance AND THE VACCINE IS A PROFOUND SYMBOL OF INJECTING A VERY SMALL DOSE OF NEGATIVITY SO THAT THE BODY CAN LEARN HOW TO DEFEND HIMSELF, HOW NOT TO BE TOO MUCH AFFECTED... A VACCINE CAN BE COMPARED TO A NIGHTMARE THAT THE UNIVERSE IS SENDING SO THAT OUR CONSCIOUSNESS CAN BE READY TO TRANSFORM THE NEGATIVE MEMORIES THAT DWELL IN THE SOUL... SO HERE YOU SEE CERTAIN DIFFICULTY TO UNDERSTAND THAT EVIL IS EDUCATIONAL... THAT EVIL EXISTS TO SERVE THE GOOD... ] . The first injection is basic all-around protection, 2nd injection is for better protection. AND THE FACT THAT EVERYONE HAS ONE FIRST INJECTION BEFORE GOING OUT SHOWS THE % OF ATTITUDE IN YOU WHERE YOU WOULD SOMETIMES BE TOO KEEN TO COME OUT OF THE UNEASY SITUATION CONSIDERING THAT YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF THE SITUATION, BUT MIGHT NOT BE FULLY EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION. FOR E.G YOU CAN FEEL THAT THE TIME IS RIGHT TO CHANGE THE JOB, BUT PERHAPS YOUR PREPARATION FOR A CHANGE IS NOT FOOLPROOF AS OF NOW. IT IS LIKE CHANGING THE JOB WILL HELP YOU TO AVOID EXPERIENCING THE DIFFICULT EMOTIONS, MEMORIES THAT YOU CAN EVENTUALLY LIVE IN YOUR CURRENT JOB... BUT AS SAID IN THE PREVIOUS DREAM, IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO MEDITATE ON THE MEMORIES THAT YOU ARE LIVING IN YOUR CURRENT JOB... BECAUSE THESE MEMORIES WILL ACCOMPANY YOU EVERYWHERE AND EVEN AFTER THIS LIFE IF THESE MEMORIES ARE NOT TRANSFORMED INTO WISDOM... THAT IS WHY SEEING YOUR MEMORIES IN DREAMS IS SUCH A BLESSING FOR YOUR SOUL... BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE TOOLS TO REPROGRAM EVERYTHING... In working and relationships with colleagues, I lack understanding and sharing, and at the same time, I have excessive defensiveness while working with others. When we started going out, everyone had done with the first injection. AND IN THE LOGIC OF MATTER, IT NEEDS TO HAVE TIME BETWEEN THE FIRST AND THE SECOND INJECTION... SO HERE IT MEANS THAT YOU CAN BE TOO IMPATIENT, YOU WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND IN MATTER, TO LIVE SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY THAN YOUR ACTUAL JOB... BECAUSE THE COVID IS ALSO RELATED TO MANY COMPANIES THAT HAD TO CLOSE, IT IS THUS RELATED TO BANKRUPTCY, INSECURITIES, FEAR OF LOSING, AND THESE MEMORIES CREATE A NEED FOR MATERIAL ABUNDANCE AFTERWARDS... The second injection is self-injected [- individualism, excessive self-protection, isolation, denial of help, lack of communication on the social level ] , so there are brave people who inject themselves first. THE FACT THAT THE INJECTION IS SELF-INJECTED SHOWS THE MEMORIES OF TOO MUCH EMISSIVITY AND USE OF EXCESS OF WILLPOWER TO PROTECT ONESELF. ALSO SHOWS A LACK OF SUPPORTIVE INNER GOVERNMENT, IT MEANS A DIFFICULTY TO ORGANIZE AND CREATE THE RIGHT SUPPORT FOR YOURSELF. LACK OF INNER NURSE/DOCTOR ENERGY AT THE MOMENT WHICH CAN HELP TO PROTECT. SO HERE IT SHOWS ALSO THAT SOMETIMES YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO THINGS BY YOUR OWN... YOU CAN HAVE DIFFICULTIES ASKING FOR HELP, FOR SUPPORT WHEN IT IS NEEDED... YOU ARE SHOWN MEMORIES WHERE YOU CAN BE TOO INDEPENDENT... Most people will get the 2nd injection later. After the first injection, my limbs were weak, I was very tired. So I haven't injected 2nd yet. THE VACCINE CREATES A FIGHT MECHANISM IN THE BODY, WHEREIN THE BODY FIGHTS TO PROTECT ITSELF FROM THE NEUTRALIZED VIRUS. SO YOU FEEL EXHAUSTED AFTER THE FIRST VACCINE BECAUSE OF THE MEMORIES OF OVER-EMISSIVITY AND THUS A LACK OF MOTIVATION. AND THE COVID IS ALSO RELATED TO INSTINCTUAL NEEDS, LAZINESS THAT CAN GROW IN THE UNCONSCIOUSNESS... YOU SEE CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES TO UNDERSTAND EVIL... SO IT MEANS ALSO THAT YOU CAN HAVE CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES SEEING THE EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE OF YOUR CURRENT JOB AS YOU CAN BE HYPERSENSITIVE AND HAVE THE SENSATION OF NOT ADVANCING WELL IN YOUR LIFE... (LIMBS WERE WEAK)... I tend to separate myself from everyone else, so I can't understand the difficulties people face. I also refuse to help myself from colleagues when I am in trouble. This creates a contradiction within me, draining my energy and weakening it. YES, TAKING HELP ALSO MEANS OPENNESS TO HELP OTHERS, AND WHICH MAY PUT YOU IN DIFFICULTY AS YOU MAY HAVE TO COME OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE, SO AN INNER MECHANISM WHICH SEPARATES YOU FROM OTHERS... Ly [- superficiality, inability to lead, lack of understanding of the law of resonance ] invited everyone in her team (another team in my company) to get the 2nd injection before returning. Because it was rumored that after the 2nd injection, they would have a fever [- lack of energy, ability to heal, lack of emission, ability to actualize, lack of motivation ] (meaning that when they go home, they will have a rest easier, but depending on the person). And before going back, everyone decided to get the 2nd injection. I take the initiative in protecting myself and getting along, helping people in my work, but I do it with the purpose of healing myself, I have not understood the law of my resonance with those around me. THIS SCENE IS SHOWING YOU THE FEAR YOU CAN EVENTUALLY HAVE CONCERNING THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE NEGATIVE MEMORIES WITHIN... YOU SEE THE FEAR YOU CAN EVENTUALLY HAVE WHEN YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT CHANGING A JOB... BY ASKING THE QUESTION ABOVE : WHEN IS THE RIGHT MOMENT TO CHANGE THE JOB ? THERE IS AN INTENTION WHERE YOU WOULD LIKE TO ABSOLUTELY RECEIVE THE PROTECTION OF THE UNIVERSE... HAVING THE GUIDANCE SO AS TO BE PROTECTED... SO AS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU WILL NOT EXPERIENCE THE STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS OF BANKRUPTCY, INSECURITIES, ANXIETY ABOUT THE FUTURE... SO THIS DREAM IS NOT SHOWING A PRECISE TIME BUT RATHER THE INTENTION BETWEEN THE QUESTION YOU ASKED... WHERE YOU CAN LACK RECEPTIVITY AND BE MORE IN AN EMISSIVE DYNAMIC, WANTING TO DO THE INJECTION AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, TO BE PROTECTED FROM THE NEGATIVITY, FROM NEGATIVE SITUATIONS THAT CAN EVENTUALLY OCCUR IN THE FUTURE JOB... BUT HAVING FEAR AT THE SAME TIME... Because of self-injection, everyone was quite scared. Ly picked up 2nd injection, but she could not self-inject. Ly asked another sister [- represents the feminine part of my unconscious, aggressive, strong, cold, lacking in self-compassion, lack receptive, capable of excessive emission ] to inject for her. During that process, Ly was afraid and tried to stop her, but she didn't listen. She thinks that Ly is just too scared, the injection is okay and will be done quickly. A part of me, recognizing my own weakness on a social level, pushed myself to be stronger, more aggressive, more draconian, and more apathetic. I lacked listening and communicating with my inner parts THIS SCENE IS SHOWING YOU THE DUALITIES... WANTING TO HAVE THE VACCINE, BEING AFRAID AT THE SAME TIME OF IT... AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE VACCINE WILL AWAKE CERTAIN NEGATIVE MEMORIES THAT ARE WITHIN RELATED TO THE COVID-19: INSECURITIES, LAZINESS, INSTINCTUAL NEEDS, ETC. SO IT IS IMPORTANT IN YOUR WORK TO UNDERSTAND PROFOUNDLY THE DISTURBANCE YOU MAY FEEL... SO AS NOT TO REACT TOO INTENSELY REGARDING CERTAIN NEGATIVE ASPECTS THAT YOU MAY FEEL AT WORK... After injecting, Ly came back to blame her, why she still inject. I added: if it were me, I would do it quickly too. I don't think it really hurts. After that, the injection will probably still bleed a little. I still don't inject. SO YOU SEE THE DUALITIES HERE NHU, ON THE INTELLECTUAL LEVEL YOU MAY THINK THAT THERE IS NO PAIN BUT STILL ON THE PHYSICAL LEVEL YOU ARE NOT WILLING FOR INJECTION. AND THE NEEDLE IS ALSO THE NOTION OF OVER-EMISSIVITY, BEING TOO INTRUSIVE IN THE ENERGY... IT IS LIKE ALSO YOU HAVE DIFFICULTIES RECEIVING A BEAUTIFUL SUPPORT TO UNDERSTAND THAT EVIL IS EDUCATIONAL... THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE THIS INJECTION SO AS TO CREATE A GOOD IMMUNE SYSTEM... AND YOU SEE THAT IT IS NOT REALLY AT THE RIGHT PLACE SINCE YOU WERE NOT IN A HOSPITAL OR IN A PROPER STRUCTURE... IT SHOWS MEMORIES WHERE YOU CAN BE TOO INDEPENDENT, WANTING TO DO THINGS BY YOURSELF... My inner Ly has no understanding of why my inner "another sister" is cold and harsh to myself, because of my inner Ly's weakness. When there is an inner conflict going on, I tend to flee (I still don't inject) YOU CAN COMPLETE WITH COMMENTS ABOVE :-) This dream shows I lack understand and compassion on work, communicate with others on social level. There are parts in me conflict and struggle, and again, I choose to flee when I can't understand law of resonance.IT IS WELL SUMMARIZED... ALSO, THE DREAM SHOWS A TOO CASUAL BEHAVIOR IN TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF SOMETIMES. FOR VACCINATION THERE SHOULD BE A TRAINED PERSON, WHO CAN EVEN MONITOR THE PATIENT AFTER THE VACCINATION. SO IT SHOWS A LACK OF PROPER PROTOCOL IN THE INNER WORLD WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING YOURSELF SPIRITUALLY STRONG TO FACE THE ORDEALS OF LIFE. 23/07/2025, 11:20 ask right time | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/90646 2/4 THE VACCINE IS THE LIQUID, IS A MEDICINE WHICH ENHANCES IMMUNITY AGAINST A VIRUS. SO IF WE SEE THIS EQUATION, SOMETIMES THE SENSE OF COMMITMENT, A LITTLE ALERTNESS AND AWARENESS ARE NEEDED TO KEEP US PROTECTED FROM THE IMPACT OF THE ENVIRONMENT OUTSIDE US. BUT THIS COMMITMENT, AWARENESS, AND ALERTNESS ARE TO BE PRACTICED IN OUR INTIMACY FIRST, SO THAT WE CAN GIVE OURSELVES THE INNER MEDICINE WHICH HEALS OUR EMOTIONS, OUR MEMORIES. WE CAN DO THIS DURING MOMENT OF MEDITATIONS AND WITH THE ANGELICA MANTRA SO AS TO CONCENTRATE THE GOOD AND SPIRITUAL INTENTION WITHIN... , SO THAT GRADUALLY THE INNER VIRUSES CAN BE OVERCOME/TRANSCENDED... THE DREAM ASKS YOU TO PREPARE WELL AND CREATE AN INNER SENSE OF PROTECTION BEFORE LOOKING FOR ANOTHER JOB. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU CAN REFLECT ON WHAT KIND OF MEMORIES YOUR CURRENT JOB AWAKENS... WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE VERY SENSITIVE AND THIS DREAM IS SHOWING THAT A SLIGHT DOSE OF NEGATIVE CAN CREATE FEAR, REJECTION, WANTING TO FLEE NEGATIVITY, WANTING TO OVER-PROTECT YOURSELF... AND THESE STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS ARE NOT NECESSARILY VISIBLE ON THE OUTSIDE... BUT YOU MIGHT FEEL IT IN YOUR EMOTIONS... And I want to ask about how to interpret a dream correctly. Because I think that it belongs to mood, emotion and results,... (something like that) to decide it is good (blue) or bad dream (red), then all the symbols on that dream will be interpreted as the same color. However, on the dream "Fighting with 2 sisters", Assistant Professor An said: it is a good dream, and I don't know why. There should be positive and negative symbols mixed in 1 dream, if that symbol is put in the right place? THANK YOU NHU FOR YOUR PROFOUND QUESTION... IT SHOWS HOW PROFOUNDLY YOU WOULD LIKE TO LEARN THE SYMBOLIC LANGUAGE AND ALL THE EFFORTS THAT YOU ARE PUTTING IN SO AS TO CHANGE AND TRANSFORM YOUR LIFE... BY SAYING THAT IT WAS A GOOD DREAM, IT IS TO EXPRESS HOW GOOD IT IS TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND OUR MEMORIES WHETHER IT IS POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE... EVERY DREAM IS A GOOD DREAM FOR OUR SOUL, DEAR NHU... . EACH DREAM SHOWS US THE ASPECTS THAT WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF SO THAT WE CAN WORK UPON WITH GENTLENESS, PERSEVERANCE, AND A SENSE OF POWERFUL EFFORT... AND IN THE SUBTLETY OF LIFE AND DREAM, SOMETIMES THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASPECTS ARE MIXED TOGETHER... SO AT THAT MOMENT, IN YOUR DREAM JOURNAL YOU CAN NUANCE... IN YOUR DREAM YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF SPILL A GLASS BUT IF IN YOUR DREAM, YOU ARE STABLE AND BEING ABLE TO TIDY WITH A GOOD ENERGY IT MEANS THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO MANAGE THE EMOTION WITH CALMNESS EVEN THERE IS A SPILLED GLASS... AT THAT MOMENT, YOU CAN STILL PUT IN THE NEGATIVE SYMBOL BECAUSE OF THE SPILLED WATER BUT NUANCE IT, SAYING THAT EVEN THOUGH THE GLASS IS SPILLED, YOU WERE ABLE TO MANAGE THE "OVERFLOW" OF EMOTION... DEPENDING UPON THE TONE OF THE DREAM, THE SYMBOL CAN BE MINUS OR POSITIVE. FOR E.G HERE ADMINISTERING VACCINE IS NEGATIVE, WE NEED TO LOOK INTO THE MINUS ASPECT BECAUSE IT IS NOT ADMINISTERED IN THE RIGHT SPACE, CONTEXT, AND NOT WITH A GOOD INTENTION... (HAVING FEAR IN THE DREAM, FORCING OTHERS TO HAVE THE INJECTION, ETC.)... FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN SEE A VERY CALM SNAKE IN YOUR DREAM BUT IF IT IS IN A HOUSE, IT IS NOT AT THE RIGHT PLACE... SO IT BECOMES AUTOMATICALLY NEGATIVE... AND YOU WILL SEE WITH TIME AND PRACTICE, DEAR NHU, IT WILL BECOME EASIER FOR YOU TO DECODE YOUR DREAM... AND WE CAN SAY THAT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, YOU HAVE IMPROVED SO PROFOUNDLY... WE ARE HAPPY TO WITNESS YOUR EVOLUTION YOU CAN CONGRATULATE YOURSELF FOR THIS YEAR! ANGELIC INTEGRATION OF THE UNDERSTANDING THAT EVIL IS EDUCATIONAL AND THAT YOU CAN TRANSFORM ANY NEGATIVE MEMORIES WITH LOVE AND WISDOM WITH MANAKEL ÂN

title_pdf: Coffee and Talk. last case id: C0204. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 27 May 2022 Angel: 36 Menadel Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello Professor ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU I had no dreams this week while chanting Angel Menadel, and thanks to Menadel I have had time to reflect on the work I am doing and realize my connection with my physical Angel - Imamiah, recognizing my own errors and correcting them. OK, WE UNDERSTAND DEAR NHU... WE SEE THAT YOU HAVE SHARED A REAL LIFE INCIDENT... THIS IS A WONDERFUL IDEA... IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO DECODE YOUR CONCRETE LIFE SYMBOLICALLY... WE ARE HAPPY TO SEE YOU DOING IT SO WELL My job is about internal operations in the enterprise. I take care of setting up working procedures, setting standards for the work of each department, and guiding personnel to do the best work. And of course, while people work, there are always problems. And I am also the one who needs to see the problem, fix it and guide the staff to correct it. In particular, the companies I have worked with are all about technology products, so my operations are related to technology and engineering a lot. I understand that one of my important missions in this life is to fix the wrong codes in me - the living machine on the soul, individual level (physical, emotional, intellectual) and social level (family and work). WELL UNDERSTOOD :-)... AND IT IS ALWAYS THE ROLE OF A MANAGER... TO SOLVE PROBLEMS... AND WHEN WE SEE PROBLEMS IN AN EVOLUTIVE WAY, TO HELP US DEVELOP NEW QUALITIES, WE ALWAYS FIND A SOLUTION OR AN INSPIRATION TO FIND ANOTHER WAY 🌟 During this time, thanks to the angel Menadel, I was been activated some memories related to communication and management at work. I had a number of meetings to deal with process issues with my boss. And I have expressed disagreement with the solutions and ideas that the boss offers. At this time, I feel quite uncomfortable inside, I feel that I have a great negation with the ideas given by the boss, a feeling of imposition and inadequacy. I realized that the old patterns inside of me were very solid, they were hard to transform, so I need to listen more, be more patient and calmer. I also think these memories related to my leadership ability in previous lives, it tends to be repressive, aggressive, imposing, lack of empathy, and tolerance. Although later I realized that boss's opinions were not entirely true, he spoke with a very open, gentle and listening attitude. The problem is only on my side. YES... VERY GOOD... HERE YOU APPLIED RESONANCE AND REFERRED BACK TO YOURSELF INSTEAD OF BLAMING OTHERS ON THE OUTSIDE...WONDERFUL RECEPTIVITY IT IS NORMAL TO DISAGREE WITH OUR BOSS AT TIMES, AND IT IS PART OF THE TEAMWORK... BUT IF WE EXPRESS OUR OPINION WITHOUT GOING AGAINST THE OTHER PERSONALLY, JUST TO MAKE THE IDEA ADVANCE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, WITH A MENTALITY THAT THINKS MORE ABOUT THE TEAM, THEN A DISAGREEMENT CAN BECOME A GREAT EVOLUTIVE MOVEMENT... IT IS ALWAYS THE EGO THAT IS BEHIND THE UNCOMFORT OR A GREAT NEGATION... This week, I also had a small change in the way I work, more precisely the way our leadership team works. That is in the morning, the entire leader core will not work, but we gather together to exchange and talk about ideas and knowledge to develop the company in terms of strategy, also how to apply them to real work. And these sessions we will do at the cafe shops, where have open space to share comfortably. IT IS GOOD IDEA BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE OPEN UP WELL IN AN INFORMAL AMBIENCE... In the early sessions, the members went unevenly for some personal reasons, as well as the content in the shared stories also carried a lot of negative energy, I found myself not wanting to listen much, Although I am the main lead in these sessions. After the first 3 days, I realized that I refused a number of times to listen to people share, but I gave my opinion for people to follow. Then, today I thought and said to myself: these are the negative memories that resonate with me, please accept, understand myself, also them, and further transform myself, to listen more and empathize more. Today, I have adjusted the way I talk and listen, as well as give my suggestions to each person when they share, and also thank and give compliments when each person gives an opinion, whether it's bad or not. It might not be a good idea, but they all have good intentions to contribute to the joint operation, so I need to understand their intentions. GIVING COMPLIMENTS IS A VERY GOOD START DEAR NHU... HOWEVER, YOU CAN ALWAYS CHECK YOUR ENERGY... COMPLIMENTS SHOULD BE AUTHENTIC AND NOT TO IMPRESS OTHERS OR PLEASE THEIR EGO... IN YOUR SHARING YOU COMPLIMENTED PEOPLE EVEN WHEN THEIR IDEAS WERE NOT THAT GOOD... SO YES, YOU CAN STILL BE NON-JUDGEMENTAL AND RECEPTIVE/COMPASSIONATE TOWARDS THEM, YOU CAN ENCOURAGE AND INSPIRE THEM THAT 'OK IT IS A GOOD START, BUT LET US THINK OF SOMETHING MORE AS WELL'... SO THAT THEY ARE INSPIRED TO THINK, TO INNOVATE... Those are some things that I have come to realize and continue to work with myself with angel Menadel. Thank you WONDERFUL... THANK YOU FOR YOUR AUTHENTIC SHARING AND YOUR AMAZING EFFORTS TO APPLY THE KNOWLEDGE IN YOUR DAILY LIFE... WE WISH YOU ANGELIC EXPERIENCES AND RENEWAL OF CODES IMPRINTED IN YOUR SOUL WITH ANGELS MENADEL AND DANIEL ANGELIC REGARDS ALEXIS

title_pdf: Animal Course. last case id: C0205. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 3 June 2022 Angel: 14 Mebahel 15 Hariel Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello Professor ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NGUYEN, This week, I chanted angels according to the calendar with my question: Should I do a blockchain course? WONDERFUL INTENTION... LET'S STUDY THE DREAM TOGETHER.... Dream: I'm studying Kaya's lecture [- YOUR INNER Kaya A PART OF YOUR MASCULINE POLARITY (ACTIONS) represents the ability to actualize abstract knowledge to apply in life. Kaya's lecture on the negative side shows the possibility of difficulty in understanding and applying knowledge, difficulty in transforming distortions ] . After studying for a while, he introduces that Professor Christiane [+ Christiane represents great wisdom, empathy and healing ] had a course [- represent practical knowledge, not too theoretical. The minus is lack of ability to understand AND APPLY knowledge, practice knowledge, too theoretical ] about: unleashing YOU SEE NGUYEN, THAT EVEN THOUGH THE WORD UNLEASHING IS COMMONLY USED IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE TO RE-DISCOVER AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE'S INNER POTENTIAL AND CAPABILITIES... THE WORD LEASH IS USUALLY USED IN REFERENCE TO TYING ANIMALS.... AND THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE FOLLOWING PART OF THE DREAM... IT IS LETTING OUT YOUR INNER ANIMALS - WHETHER LAND, ACQUATIC OR AERIAL - ALL REPRESENTING DIFFERENT YET SPECIFIC STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS.... SO IN A WAY BY USING THIS WORD YOU ARE UNCONSCIOUSLY REFERRING TO YOUR INNER ANIMALISTIC POTENTIAL THAT WAS RETAINED TOO MUCH = ALL THE NEEDS YOU MAY HAVE REPRESSED INSIDE OF YOU AND THAT YOU WANT TO "UNLEASH" NOW... LIKE FOR EXAMPLE SOMEONE WHO HAD MANY PAST LIVES AS A MONK, AND SPENT TOO MUCH ENERGY RETAINING THEIR NEEDS... BUT IN THE OPPOSITE THEY CAN "UNLEASH" ANIMALISTIC BEHAVIOR IN THEM, IN THE NAME OF SPIRITUALITY... WHICH IS NOT IDEAL... IN THIS CASE, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT, YOU CAN ALSO USE WORDS LIKE DISCOVERING, ACTIVATING OR REALIZING ONE'S POTENTIAL one's potential. This course is about each person having a representative animal [- represent the instinctive energies. The minus is too much instinctive energy, material needs, aggression, repression ] inside, a person can have 1 or several animals. SO HERE WITH THE SYMBOLS OF INNER KAYA+INNER CHRISTIANE (THAT ARE IMPARTING A SPIRITUAL TRAINING)+ANIMALS, YOU COULD ALSO INFER PARTS OF YOU THAT HAVE DIFFICULTIES, AT THE MOMENT, TO TRAIN AND GAIN MASTERY OVER YOUR INNER ANIMALS (INSTINCTUAL VITAL ENERGIES, NEEDS AND DESIRES)... ALSO, SINCE INNER KAYA AND CHRISTIANE (MASCULINE AND FEMININE POLARITY) ARE IMPARTING A SPIRITUAL TRAINING+COMBINED WITH YOUR INTENTION OF BLOCK CHAIN COURSE = SHOWS AN IMBALANCE, AT THE MOMENT, TO MARRY SPIRIT AND MATTER AND DIFFICULTIES TO HAVE HARMONY IN YOUR WORLD OF EMOTIONS AND ACTIONS BECAUSE YOUR INTENTION COULD BE ORIENTED TOWARDS NEEDS TO BE RICH FOR EXAMPLE... WITH THE PRESENCE OF SYMBOL OF KNOWLEDGE (KAYA AND CHRISTIANE) ABOVE, IT ALOS MEANS THAT SOMETIMES YOU CAN USE SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE TO FULFILL YOUR MATERIAL NEEDS (ANIMAL). I was shown that I had a lot of instinctive energy, inner material need that needed to be identified and transformed. YES, WELL SEEN ... YOU CAN ALSO CONTEMPLATE ON YOUR INTENTION BEHIND DOING THE BLOCKCHAIN COURSE. IT CAN SOMETIMES BE DRIVEN BY INSECURTIES, BEING COMPETITIVE SO AS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE MORE MONEY THROUGH BETTER OPPORTUNTIES ETC... SO WHILE THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH WANTING TO UPGRADE AND CREATE BETTER OPPORTUNITIES BUT THIS CAN SOMETIMES BE MIXED UP WITH HIDDEN NEEDS AND INSECURITIES SOMETIMES = THE INNER ANIMALS... A total of about 7 or 8 animals [- Angel 7 Achaiah - Impatience, rebellion, resignation and Angel 8 Cahetel - lack of gratitude; self-interest, self-centered, predator ] (I don't remember). They are very diverse, have aquatic animals, terrestrial, or can fly [- represents 3 levels of human being STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS RELATED TO INSTICTUAL NEEDS: physical (action, too down to earth, TOO MUCH MATERIALISTIC NEEDS), emotional (too emotional NEEDS), thought ( NEEDS OF BEING TOO airy, too open, ESCAPISM) ] such as cow, horse, crocodile, ... I'm in a rush to dig myself, and push myself to do the blockchain course (my question) without actual confirmation from the universe, I've been shown to have a lack of patience. At the same time, this scene also shows my distortions when I have a desire to do this course which is the lack of gratitude; self-interest, self-centered. WELL UNDERSTOOD AND ALSO THE HIDDEN NEEDS MIXED UP IN YOUR INTENTIONS... THIS DREAM STILL DOES NOT CLEARLY SAY WHETHER YOU SHOULD DO OR NOT DO THIS COURSE... THIS DREAM IS CURRENTLY POINTING TOWARDS PURIFYING YOUR INTENTION, BEING DETACHED AND BEING AWARE OF THESE NEEDS BEHIND YOUR INTENTION... ONCE THESE ASPECTS ARE CLEANSED IN A %, PERHAPS THE ANSWER MIGHT APPEAR TOO... :) The next scene is on the beach NOTIONS OF MATTER (SAND) AND EMOTIONS (WATER)... ON THE MINUS IT DEPICTS AN ESSENCE OF ESCAPISM (HOLIDAYING), NOT WANTING TO WORK, and the image of Kaya is in the sky YES, SO HERE IT SHOWS THAT KNOWLEDGE IS STILL AT A CONCEPTUAL LEVEL NOT YET FULLY INTEGRATED, LACK OF GLOBAL VISION, TENDENCY TO STAY AWAY WHILE YOUR INNER ANIMALS FIGHT I.E. NOT REALLY WANTING TO ASSOCIATE WITH INNER ANIMAL TENDENCIES THEREBY CREATING ILLUSORY DETACHMENT THROUGH SPIRITUALITY... SO THIS SHOWS 2 SIDES OF YOU WHICH CAN SOMETIMES CREATE DUALITY AND CONFUSIONS IN A %. And the animals all run from the sea to the land [- represent actions, instinctive needs stemming from the emotional level manifest in the action world. The minus is too impulsive, lack of balance between intellect and emotions, too emotional, lack of reason ] . And they start fighting on the sand and almost all of them get hurt. ITS LIKE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONFLICTING INSTINCTUAL NEEDS FROM EMOTIONS TO ACTIONS. SINCE ALL THIS IS IN A BEACH, IN A SUBTLE WAY IT ALSO MEANS THAT SOMETIMES YOU CAN DO THINGS (LIKE THE COURSE ABOVE) AS A MEANS TO ESCAPE... THEREBY FEEDING TO THE HIDDEN NEEDS OF WANTING TO TAKE AN INTERMISSION (HOLIDAY ON BEACH), ESCAPE, WANTING HAPPINESS AND MOMENTS FUN AND FROLIC... AND THE ANIMALS FIGHTING SHOW ALSO MEMORIES OF COMPETITION... LIKE THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE WE SEE SOMETIMES IN HIGH FINANCIAL SPHERES, WHERE PEOPLE BECOME LIKE SHARKS WHO FIGHT EACH OTHER TO MAKE THE HIGHEST NUMBERS... This scene shows that if I am still in a hurry to do what I want, it will create many inadequacies, bring a lot of aggressive, repressive, competitive, impulsive energy. And as a result, I struggled so much internally that I hurt myself. This dream shows that I am in too much of a hurry for this intention of mine, along with the real reasons behind the purpose of my intention to do the course. I need to cleanse on these distortions to get the correct answer from the Universe. WELL DISCERNED AND ALSO PLEASE REFER TOTHE COMMENTS ABOVE I would like to ask a question: if I receive the greenlight dream, answering my question, will it manifest in a dream or several dreams, or a series of dreams? IT CAN SOMETIMES BE SHOWN IN A SINGLE DREAM OR CAN BE SHOWN AFTER FEW ORE DREAMS... WHEN THE LATTER HAPPENS IT MEANS THAT THE UNIVERSE IS SIGNALLING YOU TO WORK ON THESE BLOCKAGES AND PATTERNS BEFORE YOU GET A CLEAR ANSWER. SOMETIMES ONE'S OWN NEEDS, INTENTIONS, DUALITIES ETC. CAN CREATE BLOCKAGES IN HIM/HER TO GET A CLEAR ANSWER... AND YOU CAN ALSO ACTIVATE A CONCRETE MOVEMENT AND SEE THE DREAMS THAT COME TO YOU... YOU CAN ALSO GO TO 1 OR 2 INTRODUCTION COURSES AND YOU SEE WHAT KIND OF ENERGY IS THERE... YOU STUDY IT AND SEE WHAT MEMORIES ARE TRIGGERED IN YOU... BECAUSE THE BLOCKCHAIN CAN REALLY BE A GREAT TECHNOLOGY IF IT IS USED POSITIVELY... BUT FOR THE MOMENT PEOPLE THINK ALOT ABOUT MAKING MONEY FROM IT... SO YOU NEED TO FIND THE BALANCE OF YOUR INTENTION WITHIN, WHILE ACTIVATING THE CONCRETE MOVEMENT TO STUDY YOURSELF... SO AS TO KEEP A QUALITY INTENTION NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO... ☯️ Because the day before I received this dream, I also had another dream. In that dream, I met someone who was a great expert in the field of creating courses that I was studying. She seemed to have talked to me. I don't remember exactly what the dream was, I just felt that I had decoded the story in the dream and felt that I had received the answer is yes. And the next morning when I woke up, I forgot that dream , only remembering the feeling it left. THIS ALSO MEANS THAT SOMETIMES UNCONSCIOUSLY YOU CAN LOOK FOR AN ANSWER WHICH YOU WANT TO HEAR OR SEE AND NOT NECESSARILY THE ONE THAT IS GOOD FOR YOUR SOUL EVOLUTION. THIS CREATES A BIAS SOMETIMES AND HENCE THE CONFLICTS. TRY TO BE NEUTRAL AND DETACHED ELSE THE HIDDEN BIASES CAN BLOCK YOUR CAPACITY TO RECIEVE ANSWERS :-)... EVERYTHING YOU DO OR ARE A PART OF, IS ONLY AND ONLY TO HELP YOU BECOME A BETTER PERSON... Thank you 19/08/2025, 21:38 Animal Course | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/97865 2/3 WISHINNG YOU BEAUTIFUL LEARNINGS AND REALIZATIONS WITH ANGELS PAHALIAH AND NELKHAEL ANGELIC BLESSINGS ALEXIS

They are very diverse, have aquatic animals, terrestrial, or can fly such as cow, horse, crocodile, ... I'm in a rush to dig myself, and push myself to do the blockchain course (my question) without actual confirmation from the universe, I've been shown to have a lack of patience. At the same time, this scene also shows my distortions when I have a desire to do this course which is the lack of gratitude; self-interest, self-centered.

title_pdf: Life - Strange gift. last case id: C0206. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 10 June 2022 Angel: 16 Hekamiah Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello Professor, ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU This week, I chanted Angel 16 with the question: Does the current blockchain job match the evolution of my soul? OK... Dream: When I got home (my house in my hometown) [- my inner intimacy, my inner structure, old patterns. On the minus, I don't really feel safe at home, or feel that home is the final place to come back, it shows I have the insecurities, lack of love WELL UNDERSTOOD, SO IN THIS DREAM, YOU ARE CONECTING WITH THE BLOCKAGES IN YOUR INNER STRUCTURE... ALSO SINCE IT IS YOUR HOMETOWN, IT MEANS ASPECTS RELATED TO YOUR ORIGIN ] , it was very quiet. I heard the news that Phuong (my old friend) [- this is a very close friend of mine for the past 22 years, it can be said we are close friends since birth. Phuong is a good person, always protecting me, helping me and sharing with me. However, Phuong had family injuries, had a patriarchal father, imposed, Phuong had to try to become strong. Phuong is a brave person with good leadership ability, cheerful, sociable, generous and kind. Phuong lacks of love, lacks of safety, needs recognition, has high self-esteem ALSO REFLECTS YOUR AFFINITIES, YOUR FEMININE POLARITY (WORLD OF EMOTIONS). SINCE PHUONG IS YOUR CHILDHOOD FRIEND - IT AGAIN INDICATES ORIGIN, ROOT CAUSE OF THE BLOCKS IN YOU ] is holding a graduation party [- Graduation represents recognition. Party represents the tendency to hide, rest, and laziness. The minus points are too high need for recognition, want to be centered, high ego, lack of inner security, avoidance, desire to rest ] in the evening GRADUATION, ON THE MINUS ALSO MEANS DIFFICULTIES IN YOU TO MOVE TO THE NEXT LEVEL OF LEARNING OR SEEKING NEXT LEVEL FOR MATERIAL GROWTH ONLY. ANOTHER ANGLE CAN ALSO BE THAT SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE DRIVEN TOO MUCH BY RESULTS & BENEFITS AND NOT NECESSARILY BY LEARNINGS. PARTY REFLECTS NOTIONS OF TOO MUCH IN PARTY ZONE I.E. DRIVEN BY SOCIAL EXTERNAL ASPECTS, SENSATIONS, SHOW-OFF OF SUCCESS ETC. . That lunch, Phuong wanted to meet me. YES, SO YOU CAN SOMETIMES NOURISH YOURSELF WITH THE ENERGIES OF THE MINUS OF YOUR INNER PHUONG SYMBOL. The beginning of the dream shows my blockages memories related to my question. It shows memories of inner insecurity, need for recognition, desire to be central, desire to rest, to hide. These are memories related to the work that I am doing, I need to work to clear these memories. WELL UNDERSTOOD NHU... TILL NOW IN THE DREAM, YOU ARE CONNECTING WITH ASPECTS OF YOUR INNER HOME AND INNER PHUONG + GRADUATION PARTY. ALSO IT SHOWS THAT YOUR ENTERING THE ORIGINS (ROOT CAUSE) OF THE BLOCKAGES THAT ARE BEING REVEALED TO YOU IN THIS DREAM... ALSO PLEASE REFER TO THE COMMENTS ABOVE At first, people asked me if I knew Phuong graduated, I said no, and I really didn't know. I understand people still think that we are very close, but they don't know that Phuong and I have not been in touch for a long time. But I still agree to meet Phuong at lunch. YOU SEE, THE ESSENCE OF YOUR INNER PHUONG WAS HIDDEN SOMEWHERE AND YOU NEVER REALLY CONNECTED WITH FOR A LONG TIME. HOWEVER, NOW YOUR INTENTION TOWARDS THE NEW COURSE THAT YOU WISH TO DO, HAS TRIGGERED THE RELATED MEMORIES AND MAKING YOU MEET YOUR INNER PHUONG... I hide, deny these memories and even my old friend (now I no longer have contact with this person). And I hide these memories, maybe I don't want people to know, I'm afraid they know (shown in the fact that people don't know me and Phuong are no longer in contact). But now, I have better reception, and more understanding of myself, so I agreed to meet Phuong. OK,SO NOT WANTING OTHERS TO KNOW ABOUT THE LACK OF CONNECT WITH PHUONG ALSO MEANS SOME DUALITY IN A CERTAIN %... IT IS OK TO ACCEPT THAT SOMETIMES DUE TO REASONS LIKE JOB, TRAVEL, MOVING TO A DIFFERENT PLACE ETC. OVER A PERIOD OF TIME IT IS NORMAL TO LOSE CONNECT WITH YOUR FRIENDS. BUT YOU WISH TO HIDE THIS I.E. NOTIONS OF BEING DRIVEN BY WANTING TO MAKE GOOD IMPRESSION ON OTHERS, TOO MUCH INTO PROVING YOURSELF - HAVING INSECURITIES DRIVEN BY WHAT OTHERS WILL THINK ABOUT YOU... ALSO PLEASE REFER TO THE COMMENTS ABOVE I walked in the house, wondering where my parents [- my both polarities, receptivity and emissivity, my origins ] went. After a while, I saw my parents preparing gifts for Phuong ON THE MINUS OF GIFT...PARTS OF YOU ARE PREPARING TO PLEASE OR IMPRESS YOUR INNER PHUONG, ASPECTS OF MATERIAL EXCHANGES DRIVEN BY EXPECTATIONS OF RETURN...YOU SEE, IN A % THE MINUS OF YOUR INNER PHUONG IS BEING GIVEN MORE IMPORTANCE INSTEAD OF CLEANSING OR PURIFYING THIS ESSENCE . It was a very large, black, cloth- brimmed hat [- the hat belongs to the thinking level, and represents protection, hiding. The minus points of this symbol are the tendency to want to hide, want to be the center, superiority complex, ego IN YOUR THOUGHTS. WELL UNDERSTOOD DEAR NHU ... ALSO, SINCE ITS BLACK, IT MEANS UNCONSCIOUS % IN YOUR THOUGHTS WHICH HAVE YET NOT INTEGRATED WISDOM & DISCERNMENT ] . I wonder how this hat can be worn. It is too big for a person's head, it can only be displayed, but my parents made it by hand MEMORIES OF TOO MUCH EGO, FOCUSED MORE ON DISPLAY I.E. SHOW-OFF INSTEAD OF INTEGRATING THE QUALTIES. SINCE IT IS MADE BY HAND THAT SUGGESTS THESE PATTERNS IN THE WAY YOU GIVE AND RECIEVE. I still don't understand why my parents made such a big hat, my parents just said: it's beautiful. GOOD... SO YOU SEE PARENTS ARE ALSO A SYMBOL OF WISDOM... HERE YOU HAVE STARTED TO QUESTION THE MINUS IN YOUR ORIGINS AND THE BLOCKAGES IN YOUR WISDOM The fact that the hat was made by my parents and the hand symbol shows that my blocked memories of wanting to hide, wanting to be the center, superiority complex, and ego, originate from my 2 polarities. And I was educated that those things are good things. Now, even though I was aware that it wasn't right (I found the hat to be too big), I still ignored it, without any action to stop it or explain it, to transform it (my parents still gave Phuong the hat). YES WELL DISCERNED...IT IS NOT YET TRANSFORMED BUT YOU HAVE TAKEN A VERY IMPORTANT FIRST STEP OF QUESTIONING WHAT IS NOT RIGHT Then I went to see Phuong and attended Phuong's graduation ceremony, and my parents gave Phuong the hat (I'm not sure if this part happened, but I feel it is). YOU ARE BEING SHOWN ASPECTS IN YOUR ORIGIN (YOUR INNER PARENTS GIFT THE HAT TO PHUONG) I.E. HAT+PHUONG = YOUR AFFINITIES (IN THE WAY YOU FEEL) TOWARDS SUPERIORITY COMPLEX, EGO, ENERGY OF 'DISPLAY', ASPECTS OF BEING REBEL (INNER PHUONG), ACTING BRAVE ETC. WHICH CAN LEAD TO DUALITIES AND CONFUSIONS IN YOUR LEARNING AND GROWTH. The dream shows me that I have come to accept these distortions, but I lack the courage to work to transform them. HOWEVER, THE FIRST STEP TO TRANSFORM IS TO ACCEPT. YOU ARE IN ACCEPTANCE OF THE ABOVE PATTERNS, THIS WILL LEAD TO MORE AWARENESS AND EVENTUALLY WITH YOUR WONDERFUL SELF-WORK YOU SHALL WITNESS TRANSFORMATION OF THESE ASPECTS. For the past 2 weeks, when I've kept asking myself if I should do a blockchain course, I've been triggered by distortions and it's slowly made me question myself. I have two opposing views: I want to work on blockchain because it is a very good innovative technology that can help our lives in the future, and I love technology very much. But at the same time, I also know that in the past I wanted to make a lot of money in this field. Now I no longer have this desire but I think that if I go and accept to continue working in this industry, doing blockchain courses, I will still resonate with the negative parts of this industry, which people today misunderstand and the need to make money is too high. I wondered again if I should do it, should I continue and if it was really right for me. I've been thinking a lot, and there are days when it makes me extremely tired, like these thoughts fighting on my mind, leaving me exhausted. And then I decided: stop thinking, I just do it. I need to focus on my work and finish the backlog, and it doesn't work for me no matter how much I think about it. This week, I also had a meeting with my boss. My boss gave me the company vision and mission: we will spread blockchain knowledge to more Vietnamese people. I heard this mission fits my thinking, but I know that to complete this mission, the way it is to help them gain access to cryptocurrencies, help them generate profits, and then spread the knowledge for them. I think this is a way to fit the needs of people today, that is: help them benefit first, then they will be motivated to learn about blockchain. However, this is the opposite of what I want. And really, now that I just work for a living, I feel that there are few people in this industry who work without thinking about benefits. IT IS BEAUTIFUL THAT YOU QUESTION YOUR INTENTION LIKE THIS NHU... AS WE HAD SUGGESTED LAST WEEK, FOR SOME THINGS YOU CAN STILL TAKE A CONCRETE STEP AND STUDY THE SYNCHRONICITES THAT GET UNFOLDED. THIS WILL ALSO HELP YOU DECIDE BETTER FOR E.G YOU CAN REGISTER FOR FEW INTRODUCTORY CLASSES (MAYBE FREE OR NOMINAL CHARGE) BEFORE YOU COMMIT TO THE COURSE AND SEE HOW YOU FEEL 19/08/2025, 21:39 Strange gift | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/98296 2/3 ABOUT IT. NOTICE THE FLUCTUATIONS (IF ANY) IN YOUE ENERGIES, TRIGGERS ETC. ONCE YOU MAKE AN INTENTION, HAVE THE RECEPTIVITY AND PATIENCE THAT IF SOMETHING IS MEANT FOR YOU, IT WILL COME TO YOU, PROVIDED YOU DO NOT CREATE RIPPLES THROUGH YOUR THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS. BLOCKCHAIN IS A GOOD TECHNOLOGY, THERE IS NO HARM IN LEARNING ABOUT IT, ALSO THERE IS NOTHING WRONG IN MAKING MONEY TOO... BUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO WATCH IS YOUR ENERGY, WHAT IS DRIVING YOU - IS IT LEARNING, AN OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE MOST OF (THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS TOO) OR IS IT TOO MUCH GREED, COMPETITION, SHOW-OFF ETC. YOU MENTIONED ABOUT CRYPTOCURRENCIES AS WELL... YES IT HAS ITS OWN PLUS AND MINUS BUT BLOCKCHAIN IS NOT ONLY LIMITED TO CRYPTO, THERE IS LOT OF WORK GOING ON TOWARDS USING THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR OTHER PURPOSES AS WELL FOR E.G. IN BANKING. SO YOU CAN EXPLORE AND LEARN OF ABOUT WAYS OF MAKING THINGS AROUND YOU MORE EFFICIENT (FOR EG. PAYMENTS PROCESSES) BY USING BLOCKCHAIN... SO YOU CAN WORK TOWARDS CLEANSING THE NEGATIVE PATTERNS THAT GET ACTIVATED IN YOU WHEN YOU THINK OF ENHANCING YOUR SKILLSET. BECAUSE THE NEGATIVE IS NOT IN THE TECHNOLOGY IN ITSELF... BUT THE INTENTION IN WHICH WE USE IT... WISHING YOU ANGELIC TRANSFORMATIONS, BALANCE AND PATIENCE AS YOU ADVANCE IN YOUR LEARNINGS WITH ANGELS ACHAIAH AND NELKHAEL ANGELIC REGARDS ALEXIS

title_pdf: Evolution at work. last case id: C0207. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 17 June 2022 Angel: 17 Lauviah 18 Caliel Dream and Analysis: Angelic Hello Professor , ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU This week I continue to chant the name of Angel with my intention: Does the current blockchain job match the evolution of my soul? I can't remember any dreams this week, so I'll analyze the events of the week that happened. OK... On the morning I.E. PARTS OF YOUR CONSCIOUS WORLD of this Tuesday, a close friend of mine - Giang [- a part of my feminine POLARITY, my inner Giang, is a person with good listening and receptive ability, always kind and generous, ready to help people, and giving unconditionally with love, sincerity, honesty, and loyalty. But she is also someone who is sometimes a bit naive, a bit messy, and lacking in carefully thought ] , who is studying abroad in Canada, suddenly texted me, informing me that at the end of this year she will get married [- represents a legal union. The minus point is lack of loyalty, lack of recognition from the law, evasion, fraud ] and after marriage, she will settle abroad. This news surprised me, because with Giang, I am very sure that Giang will not marry and settle abroad because her family is still in Vietnam. But, everything changed. THE NEWS OF YOUR FRIEND GETTING MARRIED IS USUALLY CONSIDERED AS GOOD NEWS... THE EMOTION OF SURPRISE IN YOU THAT SHE IS SETTLING ABROAD DEPICTS THAT IN A SMALL % YOU CAN BE TOO ATTACHED TO OLD/EXISTING WAYS OT LIFE THEREBY MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT CHANGES, VARIABLES THAT COME IN THE JOURNEY OF LIFE... THIS CAN BLOCK YOUR CAPACITY TO MANIFEST AS WELL AND FUSE YOUR POLARITIES (SYMBOL OF MARRIAGE) This event showed my state of mind: wanting to run away to a far away place, without having to think too much and still be able to do everything, whether it's legal or not, working as I please. DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE THE CASE DEAR NHU... AS PER INFORMATION SHARED BY YOU, THERE IS NOTHING WRONG IN WANTING TO MARRY AND SETTLE ABROAD... EXCEPT OF COURSE IF THE PERSON TAKES THE DECISION TOO HASTILY OR WITH A NAIVE INTENTION, WITHOUT KNOWING WELL HER PARTNER... BUT HERE THERE IS NO MENTION OF THAT... SO YOU SEE MORE THAN ESCAPISM IT IS THE EXPRESSION OF 'BEING SURPRISED OR NOT ABLE TO BELIEVE' IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN CONTEMPLATE ON... WE ALSO FEEL AN ESSENCE IN YOU OF BEING JUDGEMENTAL ABOUT THIS PART OF YOU BECAUSE YOU FEEL ABANDONED BY HER IN A WAY... I.E. DIFFICULTY TO EMPATHISE WITH OTHER PERSON'S SITUATION On the same morning, a female leader in my team - Ms. Tu [- a part of my feminine, my inner Tu is a person with a high sense of responsibility in everything, too responsible, too meticulous, too perfectionist, too detailed, comparative, and meddling in other people's affairs (prying, paying attention), imposing, strict with themselves, overly sensitive and tend to make matters worse. She is lack of love, lack of securities, lack of recognition, superiority and inferiority complex REPRESENTS ASPECTS OF YOUR EMOTIONAL WORLD... ] , told me that she wanted to take a month's leave or quit her job [- represents the desire to rest. The minus point is that you can be too lazy, want to hide, and want to rest too much ] to stop everything, because she is currently unbalanced, and losing her consciousness of everything in life, making her unable to do anything EVEN HERE, AS PER THE CONTEXT SHARED BY YOU; IT IS OK (NOT NEGATIVE) IF A PERSON IS FEELING FATIGUED, IMBALANCED DUE TO WORK (LIKE A 'BURN-OUT'), TO SOMETIMES TAKE AN INTERMISSION. As I listened to and shared with her some of my experiences, I realized that Ms. Tu is also experiencing some of the same mental health problems as I was during a period of severe depression. GOOD... HERE YOU ARE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH YOUR INNER MS. TU...THIS IS HELPING YOU TO LEARN EMPATHY AND COMPASSION FOR OTHERS. That day, after the above two stories happened, I felt like I was lost. I can't focus on work and want to do something out of my comfort zone or normal life. And I also ask myself: what should I do next? THIS IS BECAUSE YOU SEEM TO HAVE GONE IN A MODE OF COMPARISION DEAR NHU. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THAT EVERY PERSON HAS HIS/HER OWN LIFE PLAN. THESE SITUATIONS ARE ALSO A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO LEARN (BY APPLYING RESONANCE) FOR E.G. THROUGH YOUR FRIEND GIANG YOU COULD HAVE LEARNT THE IMPORTANCE OF NATURAL FLOW, ACCEPTANCE & RECEPTIVITY... AND THROUGH MS. TU YOU COULD HAVE REFERRED BACK TOWARDS IMBALANCE OR EXTREMISM (IF ANY) IN YOUR WORK STYLE AND HOW LACK OF BALANCE CAN LEAD TO TO FATIGUE... INSTEAD THERE WAS AN ELEMENT OF COMPARISION IN YOU... ITS LIKE HOW SOMETIMES WHEN LIFE BECOMES A ROUTINE THEN PEOPLE CAN WISH TO CHANGE THINGS AROUND... THIS GETS TRIGGERED ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY SEE PEOPLE/SITUATIONS AROUND THEM CHANGING... BUT IT IS ALSO INVITING YOU NOT TO BECOME TOO EXTREME IN YOUR WISH TO CHANGE... AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN COURSE... BECAUSE DEEP DOWN THERE COULD BE A % OF MOTIVATION TO GET OUT OF YOUR CURRENT LIFE, TO BE RICH AND DON'T HAVE TO DO TOO MANY EFFORTS AFTER... My current life is triggering distortions that I couldn't handle before (the main causes of my depression), and now it's resurfacing for me to keep working. This time, however, I learned to be more accepting, to listen, and to have more awareness and love. WONDERFUL NHU... YOU CAN QUESTION THAT WHAT IS THERE FOR YOU TO LEARN IN YOUR CURRENT LIFE... WHAT IS MAKING YOU NOT WANTING TO BE IN A 'NORMAL LIFE' ... NORMAL/SIMPLE CAN BE GOOD TOO... IMAGINE WHAT WOULD THE WORLD LOOK LIKE IF EVERYTHNG WAS ABNORMAL/COMPLICATED... SOMETIMES MEMORIES CAN DRIVE A PERSON TO LOOK FOR SOME SENSATION, WANTING TO PUSH THE BOUNDARIES ALWAYS... SOMETHING FOR YOU TO CONTEMPLATE DEAR NHU The next day, when I proposed to talk to my boss [- a part of my masculine, my inner boss is a person who has great listening and receptivity, has good concentration, is tolerant and giving with unconditional love, has empathy for people. He is also someone who lacks of love, lacks of recognition, lacks of security, a high ego, lack of leadership, but for me now, he is more balanced, more accepting, more aware, more fully and live more consciously, lets go of many negative things inside, purifies himself, no longer attach much to material things. As an example of developing inner qualities, of how to live and treat people, that I am looking to emulate ] about Ms. Tu's problem and some thoughts that I wanted, the talk that day was mostly my boss talking and I listen. My boss asked me to listen and understand, change the way I work and live by not trying to control everything, let go, listen and observe more. At this point, I completely understand what the boss said, because he also reminded me of these things a few times before, however, this time it seems like he expresses his suppressed emotions and tries to speak to me gently one more time. IT IS BEAUTIFUL THAT HE HAD A BEAUTIFUL ENERGY LIKE THIS... Therefore, in the talk that day, I hadn't expressed my desire or thoughts on behalf of me or everyone (I think I should suggest) in the company, but once again asked to change myself. At this point, I'm a bit sad and feel inhibited. But I understood that were issues I needed to change, and resonated with my boss as well as I needed to go inside to work on myself, not to keep trying to say any things that my boss didn't want to hear. YES YOUR INNER BOSS WAS MORE IN THE PLUS ENERGY IN THIS SITUATION, HOWEVER YOU HAVE MARKED HIM AS A MINUS SYMBOL... SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE TOO HARSH ON YOURSELF DEAR NHU... YOUR INNER BOSS GUIDED YOU WELL AND ENCOURAGED YOU TO BE MORE RECEPTIVE, BALANCED AND CHANGE THE WAY YOU WORK AND LIVE This fact shows that inside I still have a big resistance, lack of listening and understanding for my own distortions. I lack motivation and haven't really focused to work with my distortions yet. This is a sign that reminds me to work harder. YES BUT TRYING TOO HARD CAN CREATE MORE IMPATIENCE AND IMBALANCE ... REMEMBER WORKING ON YOURSELF REQUIRES YOU TO RESPECT YOUR NATURAL FLOW, COMPASSION AND PATIENCE... SLOWLY AS AWARENESS GROWS, CHANGES START TO HAPPEN... FOR E.G. YOU KNOW THAT IT IS GOOD TO GROW MORE PLANTS/TREES FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR PLANET BUT STILL EVERY SEED THAT YOU SOW, GROWS AT ITS OWN PACE, GENTLY, SLOWLY... YOU CANNOT PUSH A PLANT TO GROW FASTER... THIS IS HOW EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE WORKS... AT ITS OWN PACE.... WHILE IT IS GOOD TO BE FOCUSED AND MOTIVATED BUT YOU SEE, CLEANSING THE NEGATIVE MEMORIES CANNOT BE APPROACHED LIKE A PERFORMANCE GOAL/TARGET THAT YOU SET FOR YOUR OFFICE RELATED TASKS The next day, I went to a meeting with 2 other leaders in the company at a cafe. On the way, I met 2 policemen who were chasing a man on a motorbike violating traffic laws. When I entered the cafe, I continued to meet 2 policemen who came to check the documents of the cafe. This made me think as a signal that I needed to work with my inner couple and divine justice. When I finished the meeting and was about to leave, I met those 2 policemen who came back to check the papers and left before me. YES.. LIKE A CHECK MECHANISM FOR YOU TO REFLECT UPON HOW YOU ARE ADVANCING AND NOURISHING YOURSELF IN RELATION TO YOUR WORK :-) Currently, my work is quite stagnant and not pushed smoothly, I am quite depressed and confused about whether to continue working or not. I met a lot of resistance when working because of the knowledge of the industry, the way people work in this industry is almost only for material purposes, even they use tricks. I don't do any of these things, but working in this industry and doing this exposes me to distortions that my inner justice cannot accept. YES SOMETIMES IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO WORK IN A NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENT. BUT 19/08/2025, 21:39 Evolution at work | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/98553 2/3 ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE BEEN PUT IN THIS SITUATION TO LEARN SOMETHING, TO KNOW THE RESONANCES IN YOU. EXPLAINING THE TREE/PLANT EXAMPLE THAT WE MENTIONED EARLIER... NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES A TREE IS CUT (SOMETIMES FOR SELFISH REASONS), IT STILL GROWS AND DOES NOT LOSE ITS INHERENT QUALITIES... SIMILARLY, AS YOU ARE ALREADY DOING IT SO WELL, KEEP DOING YOU KARMA WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE... ALSO KEEP SEEKING GUIDANCE IN YOUR DREAMS Except for the ideal of my boss, he always hopes to bring blockchain technology to life, and more people to understand it. This ideal coincides with my ideas in this technology that I love. AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER AS WELL, IF YOU FEEL CONNECTED YOU CAN STILL MOVE AHEAD AND TAKE STEP TOWARDS LEARNING BLOCKCHAIN WITH AN OPENNESS TO WHAT RESONANCES AND SITUATIONS THIS TRIGGERS FOR YOU... AND MAYBE YOU COULD EVEN HELP TO IMPLEMENT THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY IN YOUR OWN COMPANY, FOR THE RIGHT PURPOSE AND INTENTION... OR SOMETHING ELSE... CONTINUE TO ASK FOR DREAMS AND SIGNS... THEY WILL GUIDE YOU ON THE RIGHT WAY... WHILE REMAINING WELL LOGIC AND NOT WANTING TO QUIT EVERYTHING... TO BALANCE YOUR WISH TO CHANGE WITH THE RIGHT INTENTION... I think I need to work more with myself to cleanse the distortions if I wish to continue to ask about this question, till the day to receive the answer. It's my last dream in the first semester this year, I would like to thank all of you who help me interpret my dreams and guide me on the path of self-transformation. I am grateful to everyone . Wishing everyone a happy, healthy and happy summer holiday THANK YOU DEAR NHU... IT IS ALWAYS A JOY TO ACCOMPANY YOU IN YOUR JOURNEY OF EVOLUTION WISHING YOU BEAUTIFUL REVELATIONS AND TRANSFORMATIONS WITH ANGELS MENADEL AND ACHAIAH ANGELIC BLESSINGS ALEXIS

She is lack of love, lack of securities, lack of recognition, superiority and inferiority complex REPRESENTS ASPECTS OF YOUR EMOTIONAL WORLD... ] , told me that she wanted to take a month's leave or quit her job [- represents the desire to rest. The minus point is that you can be too lazy, want to hide, and want to rest too much ] to stop everything, because she is currently unbalanced, and losing her consciousness of everything in life, making her unable to do anythingEVEN HERE, AS PER THE CONTEXT SHARED BY YOU; IT IS OK (NOT NEGATIVE) IF A PERSON IS FEELING FATIGUED, IMBALANCED DUE TO WORK (LIKE A 'BURN-OUT'), TO SOMETIMES TAKE AN INTERMISSION. As I listened to and shared with her some of my experiences, I realized that Ms. Tu is also experiencing some of the same mental health problems as I was during a period of severe depression. GOOD... HERE YOU ARE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH YOUR INNER MS. TU...THIS IS HELPING YOU TO LEARN EMPATHY AND COMPASSION FOR OTHERS. That day, after the above two stories happened, I felt like I was lost. I can't focus on work and want to do something out of my comfort zone or normal life. And I also ask myself: what should I do next? THIS IS BECAUSE YOU SEEM TO HAVE GONE IN A MODE OF COMPARISION DEAR NHU. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THAT EVERY PERSON HAS HIS/HER OWN LIFE PLAN. THESE SITUATIONS ARE ALSO A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO LEARN (BY APPLYING RESONANCE) FOR E.G. THROUGH YOUR FRIEND GIANG YOU COULD HAVE LEARNT THE IMPORTANCE OF NATURAL FLOW, ACCEPTANCE & RECEPTIVITY... AND THROUGH MS. TU YOU COULD HAVE REFERRED BACK TOWARDS IMBALANCE OR EXTREMISM (IF ANY) IN YOUR WORK STYLE AND HOW LACK OF BALANCE CAN LEAD TO TO FATIGUE... INSTEAD THERE WAS AN ELEMENT OF COMPARISION IN YOU... ITS LIKE HOW SOMETIMES WHEN LIFE BECOMES A ROUTINE THEN PEOPLE CAN WISH TO CHANGE THINGS AROUND... THIS GETS TRIGGERED ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY SEE PEOPLE/SITUATIONS AROUND THEM CHANGING... BUT IT IS ALSO INVITING YOU NOT TO BECOME TOO EXTREME IN YOUR WISH TO CHANGE... AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN COURSE... BECAUSE DEEP DOWN THERE COULD BE A % OF MOTIVATION TO GET OUT OF YOUR CURRENT LIFE, TO BE RICH AND DON'T HAVE TO DO TOO MANY EFFORTS AFTER... My current life is triggering distortions that I couldn't handle before (the main causes of my depression), and now it's resurfacing for me to keep working. This time, however, I learned to be more accepting, to listen, and to have more awareness and love. WONDERFUL NHU... YOU CAN QUESTION THAT WHAT IS THERE FOR YOU TO LEARN IN YOUR CURRENT LIFE... WHAT IS MAKING YOU NOT WANTING TO BE IN A 'NORMAL LIFE' ... NORMAL/SIMPLE CAN BE GOOD TOO... IMAGINE WHAT WOULD THE WORLD LOOK LIKE IF EVERYTHNG WAS ABNORMAL/COMPLICATED... SOMETIMES MEMORIES CAN DRIVE A PERSON TO LOOK FOR SOME SENSATION, WANTING TO PUSH THE BOUNDARIES ALWAYS... SOMETHING FOR YOU TO CONTEMPLATE DEAR NHU The next day, when I proposed to talk to my boss [- a part of my masculine, my inner boss is a person who has great listening and receptivity, has good concentration, is tolerant and giving with unconditional love, has empathy for people. He is also someone who lacks of love, lacks of recognition, lacks of security, a high ego, lack of leadership, but for me now, he is more balanced, more accepting, more aware, more fully and live more consciously, lets go of many negative things inside, purifies himself, no longer attach much to material things. As an example of developing inner qualities, of how to live and treat people, that I am looking to emulate ] about Ms. Tu's problem and some thoughts that I wanted, the talk that day was mostly my boss talking and I listen. My boss asked me to listen and understand, change the way I work and live by not trying to control everything, let go, listen and observe more. At this point, I completely understand what the boss said, because he also reminded me of these things a few times before, however, this time it seems like he expresses his suppressed emotions and tries to speak to me gently one more time. IT IS BEAUTIFUL THAT HE HAD A BEAUTIFUL ENERGY LIKE THIS... Therefore, in the talk that day, I hadn't expressed my desire or thoughts on behalf of me or everyone (I think I should suggest) in the company, but once again asked to change myself. At this point, I'm a bit sad and feel inhibited. But I understood that were issues I needed to change, and resonated with my boss as well as I needed to go inside to work on myself, not to keep trying to say any things that my boss didn't want to hear. YES YOUR INNER BOSS WAS MORE IN THE PLUS ENERGY IN THIS SITUATION, HOWEVER YOU HAVE MARKED HIM AS A MINUS SYMBOL... SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE TOO HARSH ON YOURSELF DEAR NHU... YOUR INNER BOSS GUIDED YOU WELL AND ENCOURAGED YOU TO BE MORE RECEPTIVE, BALANCED AND CHANGE THE WAY YOU WORK AND LIVE This fact shows that inside I still have a big resistance, lack of listening and understanding for my own distortions. I lack motivation and haven't really focused to work with my distortions yet. This is a sign that reminds me to work harder. YES BUT TRYING TOO HARD CAN CREATE MORE IMPATIENCE AND IMBALANCE ... REMEMBER WORKING ON YOURSELF REQUIRES YOU TO RESPECT YOUR NATURAL FLOW, COMPASSION AND PATIENCE... SLOWLY AS AWARENESS GROWS, CHANGES START TO HAPPEN... FOR E.G. YOU KNOW THAT IT IS GOOD TO GROW MORE PLANTS/TREES FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR PLANET BUT STILL EVERY SEED THAT YOU SOW, GROWS AT ITS OWN PACE, GENTLY, SLOWLY... YOU CANNOT PUSH A PLANT TO GROW FASTER... THIS IS HOW EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE WORKS... AT ITS OWN PACE.... WHILE IT IS GOOD TO BE FOCUSED AND MOTIVATED BUT YOU SEE, CLEANSING THE NEGATIVE MEMORIES CANNOT BE APPROACHED LIKE A PERFORMANCE GOAL/TARGET THAT YOU SET FOR YOUR OFFICE RELATED TASKS The next day, I went to a meeting with 2 other leaders in the company at a cafe. On the way, I met 2 policemen who were chasing a man on a motorbike violating traffic laws. When I entered the cafe, I continued to meet 2 policemen who came to check the documents of the cafe. This made me think as a signal that I needed to work with my inner couple and divine justice. When I finished the meeting and was about to leave, I met those 2 policemen who came back to check the papers and left before me. YES.. LIKE A CHECK MECHANISM FOR YOU TO REFLECT UPON HOW YOU ARE ADVANCING AND NOURISHING YOURSELF IN RELATION TO YOUR WORK :-) Currently, my work is quite stagnant and not pushed smoothly, I am quite depressed and confused about whether to continue working or not. I met a lot of resistance when working because of the knowledge of the industry, the way people work in this industry is almost only for material purposes, even they use tricks. I don't do any of these things, but working in this industry and doing this exposes me to distortions that my inner justice cannot accept. YES SOMETIMES IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO WORK IN A NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENT. BUT 19/08/2025, 21:39 Evolution at work | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/98553 2/3 ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE BEEN PUT IN THIS SITUATION TO LEARN SOMETHING, TO KNOW THE RESONANCES IN YOU. EXPLAINING THE TREE/PLANT EXAMPLE THAT WE MENTIONED EARLIER... NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES A TREE IS CUT (SOMETIMES FOR SELFISH REASONS), IT STILL GROWS AND DOES NOT LOSE ITS INHERENT QUALITIES... SIMILARLY, AS YOU ARE ALREADY DOING IT SO WELL, KEEP DOING YOU KARMA WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE... ALSO KEEP SEEKING GUIDANCE IN YOUR DREAMS Except for the ideal of my boss, he always hopes to bring blockchain technology to life, and more people to understand it. This ideal coincides with my ideas in this technology that I love. AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER AS WELL, IF YOU FEEL CONNECTED YOU CAN STILL MOVE AHEAD AND TAKE STEP TOWARDS LEARNING BLOCKCHAIN WITH AN OPENNESS TO WHAT RESONANCES AND SITUATIONS THIS TRIGGERS FOR YOU... AND MAYBE YOU COULD EVEN HELP TO IMPLEMENT THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY IN YOUR OWN COMPANY, FOR THE RIGHT PURPOSE AND INTENTION... OR SOMETHING ELSE... CONTINUE TO ASK FOR DREAMS AND SIGNS... THEY WILL GUIDE YOU ON THE RIGHT WAY... WHILE REMAINING WELL LOGIC AND NOT WANTING TO QUIT EVERYTHING... TO BALANCE YOUR WISH TO CHANGE WITH THE RIGHT INTENTION... I think I need to work more with myself to cleanse the distortions if I wish to continue to ask about this question, till the day to receive the answer. It's my last dream in the first semester this year, I would like to thank all of you who help me interpret my dreams and guide me on the path of self-transformation. I am grateful to everyone .

title_pdf: The 2 laptops open. last case id: C0208. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 19 August 2022 Angel: 29 Reiyel Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello Professor ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU Here is my dream: I am in my hometown. My father [- my origin masculine polarity. The minus is infidelity, lack of honesty, lack of recognition, lack of love ] drove me by car [- advance in the social level collectively. The minus is difficult advancing toward others, lack of respect and consideration for others ] to a high school friend's wedding [- community recognition of the couple's union. The minus is lack of recognition, the imbalance between two polarities, the improper fusion ] . Because I was busy with work, I told my friend in advance that I would be late. So when I arrived, the wedding was almost over. WELL CONNECTED DEAR NHU... YES THIS DREAM STARTS IN HOMETOWN AND ALSO YOU ARE WITH YOUR INNER FATHER... THIS DEPICTS THAT YOU CONNECTED WITH MEMORIES OF YOUR ORIGINS, ROOT CAUSE WHICH LEAD TO CERTAIN PATTERNS AND MEMORIES LIKE INFIDELITY, LACK OF HONESTY, AS YOU MENTIONED ETC. ... THIS IS ALSO RELATED TO THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS IN YOU... WHEN YOU ARRIVED, THE WEDDING WAS OVER AND YOU HAD INFORMED IN ADVANCE ABOUT YOUR WORK... THIS DEPICTS (ON THE MINUS) THAT SOMETIMES YOU CAN USE YOUR WORK AS A MEANS TO GAIN IMPORTANCE AND ATTENTION AMONGST YOUR SOCIAL CIRCLE, ASPECTS OF SUPERIORITY COMPLEX TO FEEL IMPORTANT & BUSY... DIFFICULTY TO BALANCE AND PRIORITIZE WELL YOUR WORK ASPECT VERSUS YOUR SOCIAL LEVEL... THE ENERGY THAT YOU RESONATE WITH YOUR INNER FATHER SYMBOL IS ACCOMPANYING YOU.... I.E. LACK OF AUTHENTICITY/HONESTY, LACK OF RECOGNITION ETC. SO HERE YOU CAN SEE THESE MEMORIES ARE RELATED TO BLOCKAGES WHICH CAN LIMIT YOU FROM ADVANCING TOWARDS YOUR INNER WEDDING (I.E. BALANCE OF POLARITIES) The first paragraph of the dream showed how I express on a social level to advance that having difficulty because I lacked inner and outer recognition. This is my old pattern from the memories of my lifetimes when I return to my inner home (hometown). The wedding was held on the beach [- laziness, desire to rest too much, difficulty in connecting emotions and actions, difficulty in actualizing, ESCAPISM ] and friends came in large numbers A HIGHER % OF NEGATIVE AFFINITIES TOWARDS THE ASPECTS MENTIONED ABOVE. Right now, everyone is having fun and taking selfies [- too much attachment to the past AND ALSO NOTIONS OF BEING SELF- CENTERED, A % OF BEING SELF-ABSORBED, living with the old pattern, difficulty in transforming and moving forward ] together. Then they got into a car. Perhaps people to about to leave. The other guests were still sitting outside. THESE ARE VARIOUS PERCENTAGES (MANY FRIENDS) IN YOU WHICH CAN SOMETIMES THINK A BIT TOO MUCH ABOUT SELF... THEY TAKE THEIR SELFIE AND THEN GET IN A CAR TO LEAVE EVEN WHEN IT SEEMS GUESTS ARE STILL THERE AND IT APPEARS THAT THE FUNCTION IS NOT YET OVER... DEAR NHU, WHILE REALISTICALLY IT IS ALSO OK TO TAKE SELFIES, HAVING FUN OR LEAVE AT DIFFERENT TIMES ( IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO ALWAYS WAIT FOR THE EVENT TO BE COMPLETED), BUT SYMBOLICALLY THIS NEEDS TO BE SEEN IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DREAM I tend to be lazy and want to live in the past, to avoid facing reality. ALSO PLEASE REFER TO THE COMMENTS ABOVE. I told my dad that I went to meet my friends for a while and then returned. I went into the car to greet everyone, and everyone seemed surprised, asking me why now I had just arrived. I said I was busy so I was late. TENDENCY TO SHOW THAT YOU ARE MOSTLY BUSY WHEN YOUR INNER FRIENDS ASK FOR THE REASON TO BE LATE... WHILE ONE WAY IT IS GOOD THAT YOU STILL MADE IT EVEN AFTER BEING BUSY BUT IN THIS DREAM THE ESSENCE IS THAT YOU SOMETIMES WANT TO BE THERE WITH THE GROUP/FRIENDS AND HAVE MOMENTS OF FUN/LAUGHTER ETC. BECAUSE IT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE IF YOU DIDN'T ATTEND TO THE WEDDING CEREMONY OF YOUR FRIEND, AND DON'T EVEN TALK TO HER OR CONGRATULATE HER FOR BEING MARRIED... IT SHOWS A FORM OF RETICENCE TO FUSE YOUR POLARITIES IN A WAY, AND BE TOO MUCH INTO THE WORKING / SOCIAL LIFE, WITHOUT GIVING ENOUGH ATTENTION AND IMPORTANCE TO THE COUPLE... AS IF YOU COULD UNCONSCIOUSLY REFUSE THE COUPLE / MARITAL LIFE AT TIMES BECAUSE YOU PRIORIZE WORK / SOCIAL LIFE TOO MUCH (ARRIVING IN THE END WHEN FRIENDS ARE TAKING SELFIES)... AND YOU CAN MAKE THE LINK HERE WITH YOUR FATHER LIVING INFIDELITIES... BECAUSE OF THE EXAMPLE OF YOUR PARENTS, YOU MAY HAVE RECORDED THAT THE COUPLE = DIFFICULTIES, PROBLEMS, AND THEN REFUSE IT NOW AT A CERTAIN %... BUT ALSO YOU WANT TO SEEK IMPORTANCE BY MAINTAINING A DISTANCE... THIS CAN SOMETIMES CREATE DUALITIES/CONFUSIONS IN YOU DER NHU... YOU CAN INTROSPECT ON THIS ASPECT I went down to the end of the car WE CAN NOTICE THIS THEME/PATTERN IN YOUR DREAMS. YOU ARE MOSTLY SEEN SITTING/STANDING A BIT AWAY OR FAR FROM OTHERS... EVEN HERE YOU WENT TO ONE END OF THE CAR. There are 2 laptops open [- my inner 2 polarities, my inner living computer. The open laptops represent my inner computer that has been working for a long time and needs to be shut down at the right time. The minus is the difficulty in resting at the right time and working effectively, sometimes tend to too fast, focus on result ] on the table, it seems to be working. IT IS LIKE IF YOU WANTED TO GO BACK TO WORK AGAIN HERE... 😉 NOT NORMAL TO HAVE TABLE IN A CAR I.E. DIFFICULTY TO SHARE GOOD MOMENTS, THOUGHTS, EMOTIONS, IDEAS ETC. ALSO ON THE MINUS LAPTOPS DEPICTS NOTIONS OF LACK OF CONNECT WITH OTHERS, WITH THE UNIVERSAL NETWORK, DIFFICULTY TO PROCESS INFORMATION AND DATA ... THIS IS IN RELATION (NOTIONS OF 2) WITH YOUR COUPLE / RELATIONAL DIMENSION... THIS APPEARS BECAUSE OF THE MINUS OF THE WORK ASPECT IN YOU. (These are my 2 MacBooks, an old one I sold and a new one I'm currently using ON THE MINUS, MACBOOK CAN REPRESENT SHOW-OFF, SUPERIORITY COMPLEX, LUXURY, WANTING RECOGNITION ETC. IN THE WAY YOU CONNECT WITH OTHERS). I turned off the laptops and was about to take them away when a friend approached me and asked me: Are your laptops? I smiled and replied softly: ah that's right, I'll bring them back so I can handle the work. A CONTINUATION OF THE PATTERNS MENTIONED ABOVE... IN A SUBTLE WAY... THERE IS AN ESSENCE HERE THAT YOU LIKED THIS ATTENTION... YOU SMILED, MAINTAINED POISE BY REPLYING SOFTLY... A MOMENT TO SHOW THAT YOU ARE A BUSY AND WANTED TO HANDLE WORK WHILE SITTING IN A CAR WITH YOUR FRIENDS... ... THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL TEACHING IN THIS DREAM DEAR NHU TO HELP YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR MEMORIES RELATED TO THE WORK ASPECT, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOW IT COULD PREVENT YOU TO FUSE WELL YOUR POLARITIES, YOUR COUPLE... SO AS TO HELP YOU TO BALANCE BOTH WELL NOW I tend to be hard on myself, letting the inner computer work a lot and at the wrong times, not knowing when to take a break. I have realized this and gradually changed (a friend come to ask me). YES... THAT IS TRUE BUT IT CAN ALSO BE SOMETIMES AN EXCUSE TO DISTANCE YOURSELF FROM OTHERS THEREBY SEEKING ATTENTION, RECOGNITION ETC. AND IT PREVENTS YOU TO CONNECT YOUR INNER COUPLE WELL... Maybe everyone had seen them before and didn't know whose they were. Then I closed and took 2 laptops home. Dad drove me home. ANOTHER SUBTLE INDICATION HERE DEAR NHU.. AFTER SHOWING TO YOUR FRIENDS AND SPEAKING ABOUT HANDLING WORK ETC. YOU CLOSED YOUR LAPTOP AND LEFT FROM THERE... MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE TAKEN SOMETIME TO TALK AND CONNECT WITH YOUR FRIENDS, GETTING TO KNOW THEM ETC. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN... THIS SUGGESTS NOTIONS OF BEING FOCUSSED ON SELF BECAUSE YOU DON'T EVEN MENTION YOUR FRIEND WHO JUST MARRIED... SO YOU WENT THERE MORE FOR THE FRIENDS THAN FOR THE WEDDING = MEMORIES WHERE YOU DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THE COUPLE LIFE ANYMORE BECAUSE IT HAS BROUGHT TOO MANY PROBLEMS... 19/08/2025, 21:40 The 2 laptops open | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/99454 2/3 The dream showed me that I need to relax at the right time and change the way I work, also the way I advance on the social level, to understand the recognition from inside and outside. WELL DISCERNED DEAR NHU In the morning I had this dream, when I woke up, I still had a big headache as recently. The previous afternoon, I just did an Angelica Yantra with Therapist An Nguyen. Because lately, my headaches come back when I have too much work and stress. I have such a headache that there are times when I cannot work. When I went to the hospital, the doctor told me that I had cervical spondylosis, which blocked blood flow to the brain, causing headaches for me such as anemia in the brain, low blood pressure, and vestibular disorders. And this is a disease that can't be cured with medicine, but it needs to get rid of stress. When treating me, Mr. An explained to me that 3 main things cause headaches. Firstly, I have too many thoughts, ideas, and knowledge stuck in my head, I lack the ability to actualize and transform them into practical actions, and I lack discipline. The second is that inside I still have extreme resistance, and stubbornness to things that happen to me, I don't have a proper receptivity and understanding. The third is that I lack trust in the people around me, especially my colleagues at work. So I rarely empower them, but I still tend to put pressure on them, even scaring them. From there, they will not be able to work well and support me in my work. Since then, it has made me hug more and more stressed. YES WE ARE GLAD THAT YOU ARE IN AWARENESS OF YOUR PATTERNS AND TAKING RIGHT & TIMELY GUIDANCE ... WITH THE DREAM ABOVE YOU ALSO NOW KNOW THAT THIS TENDENCY TO HAVE EXCLUSIVITY, DISTANCE FROM OTHERS BY USING WORK AS A REASON ADDS ON TO THE PRESSURE THAT KEEPS BUILDS UP INSIDE YOU... YOU SEE THIS CREATES CONFLICT WITH OTHER PARTS OF YOU WHICH WANT TO RELAX, HAVE A GOOD TIME ETC... AND THIS PROBLEM TO FUSE YOUR INNER COUPLE AND POLARITIES CAN ALSO BE BEYOND YOUR HEADACHE... BECAUSE YOU MAY NOT ALWAYS TAKE THE TIME TO TALK TO YOURSELF, TO REASSURE YOURSELF WELL, HAVING A KIND INNER DIALOGUE BETWEEN YOUR INNER AND OUTER WORLD... YOUR MASCULINE AND YOUR FEMININE... ALSO IT APPEARS FROM YOUR SHARING THAT YOU ARE NOT DOING YOUR WORK OUT OF JOY, THIS CAN DISTURB TEAM DYNAMICS BECAUSE YOU WOULD ALSO EXPECT THE SAME FROM OTHERS... IN A WAY THERE IS NO OUTLET FOR THE PRESSURE WITHIN AND HENCE THE HEADACHES... WE SUGGEST YOU TAKE INTERMISSIONS REGULARLY WHEN YOU ARE AT WORK, CLOSING YOUR EYES FOR A FEW SECONDS, WALK A LITTLE, BREATHE DEEPLY TO RE-FOCUS YOUR INTENTION WHILE WORKING... AND IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO WHEN YOU ARE ALONE, GOING OUT SOMETIME FOR YOGA AND BREATHING EXERCISES (AIR = THOUGHTS) TO HELP YOU BALANCE AND RELAX. DEAR NHU...WE APPRECIATE YOUR GENUINITY TO REALLY KNOW MORE AND WORK TOWARDS YOUR PATTERNS... KEEP UP THE WONDERFUL SELF- WORK BUT ALWAYS REMEMBER TO RESPECT YOUR OWN PACE AND NOT BE TOO HARSH ON YOURSELF ... YOU ARE NOT ONLY THE MINUS ASPECTS THAT THE DREAM SHOWS, YOU ALSO HAVE BEAUTIFUL QUALITIES... REMEMBER TO APPRECIATE THEM AS WELL. WISHING YOU ANGELIC JOY AND BETTER INTEGRATION OF THE WORK AND COUPLE SYMBOL, TO FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE IN YOUR POLARITIES... WITH ANGELS MENADEL AND JELIEL ☯️ ANGELIC REGARDS ALEXIS

title_pdf: Life A new friend. last case id: C0209. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 26 August 2022 Angel: 30 Omael Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello Professor ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU In fact, I've only known a friend (her name is Thuong [- For me, Thuong is a person who will not think too much about things that are not important, is quite carefree, does not calculate details, and is very proactive. She knows what she wants, needs, and does. She's forward. She is also a delicate, understanding person with more mature thoughts than her age. Inside she still wants to be a little girl who wants to love and be loved. I realized that Thuong is a person who lacks of love inside, so she looks for love outside to make up for this deficiency, even though she cares about everyone around her too deeply and too much, causing her inside to be missing. THE LACKS (ON THE INSIDE) AND EXCESS (ON THE INSIDE) ARE COMPENSATORY MECHANISMS HERE... She seeks affirmation, recognition, high ego, and high possessiveness. ] ) for more than a month. We met through an LGBT community on Facebook. I shared my story and Thuong also sympathized with me, then we got to know each other and started talking.SOMETIMES FRIENDSHIPS AND RELATED AFFINITIES CAN BE DRIVEN BY INNER LACKS AND NEEDS DEAR NHU... AS YOU HAVE SHARED, THUONG FIRST SYMPATHIZED WITH YOU AND THEN YOU STARTED CONNECTING...SO YOU SEE % MEMORIES OF LACK OF LOVE, SUPPORT ETC (AS YOU HAVE SEEN WELL) WHICH CAN LEAD A PERSON TO LOOK FOR COMPENSATION OF THESE ASPECTS ON THE OUTSIDE BUT ALSO CAN TRIGGER IN HER A SAVIOR SYNDROME WHICH GETS TRIGGERED WHENEVER SHE COMES ACROSS A SITUATION WHICH WARRANTS SYMPATHY...SOMETIMES THIS CAN ALSO IN A SUBTLE WAY FEED INTO ONE'S EGO... ON THE OUTSIDE IT MAYE SEEM TO BE GOOD CAMARADERIE BUT THERE CAN BE DUALITY WITHIN... SOMETHING FOR YOUR TO INTROSPECT ON DEAR THUONG...BECAUSE THERE IS NO COINCIDENCE THAT YOU ATTRACTED HER AS A FRIEND... AND YOU CAN SEE IN WHICH INTENTION YOU STARTED TO DISCUSS WITH HER... BECAUSE IF AS A WOMAN, YOU WRITE TO WOMEN IN AN LGBT COMMUNITY FORUM ON FACEBOOK, YOU WILL ATTRACT WOMEN WHO COULD BE IN LOVE WITH YOU... At that time, Thuong told me that Thuong had just broken up with her ex-lover [- She is also a girl. I perceive her to be a beautiful soul but she has lived many karmic consequences of abuse, sexual assault, possessiveness, harshness, hatred, and overindulgence in this life. She was born into a family that created too much trauma for her. And I feel Thuong's feelings for her are more dependent on the family situation than love.YES... WELL DISCERNED... YOU CAN SEE THE SAME PATTERN GETTING REPEATED HERE AS WELL (AS MENTIONED ABOVE)...HER FEELINGS WERE MORE COMING FROM THE FAMILY SITUATION AND NOT LOVE (% MEMORIES OF EMOTIONAL AND AFFECTIVE DEFENDENCIES)...SO FOR THUONG SHE CAN HAVE A TENDENCY THAT WHENEVER SHE FEELS SYMPATHY FOR SOMEONE SHE CAN COME ACCROSS LIKE A SAVIOUR IN THE NAME OF WANTING TO CARE, TO LOVE ETC. BUT THAT MAY NOT BE TRUE ALWAYS...IT CAN ALSO BE A MIX-UP TO COMPENSATE FOR INNER LACKS AND ALSO TO FEED IN TO ONE'S EGO... ] 2 weeks ago and was still a bit emotionally hurt. And we started to share these stories with each other, I felt that we talked quite well and quite comfortably. After a few weeks, I realized that Thuong hadn't really broken up with her ex, because her ex wanted to hold on to Thuong. Although intellectually, Thuong wants to stop, but emotionally, I know that Thuong still loves that person very much. And I also found that I have quite a lot of feelings for Thuong. YOU CAN MEDITATE ON THE RESONANCES THAT YOU FELT AND UNDERSTAND YOUR INNER THUONG... SOMETIMES OWING TO THE SAVIOR SYNDROME... PEOPLE FEEL THAT IF THEY COME ACROSS SOMEONE WHOM THEY PERCEIVE TO BE WEAK, LOW, IN DIFFICULT SITUATION (AGAIN IT CAN BE THEIR PERCEPTION AND NOT NECESSARILY THE TRUTH)...SO FOR THEM, SAVING THE OTHER BECOMES LIKE PROJECT WHICH THEY WANT TO BE ENGAGED IN ALWAYS... THIS MAKES THEM FEEL IMPORTANT... IN YOUR SHARING AS WELL...WHEN SHE COULD NOT GO FURTHER WITH HER EX-LOVER SHE DISCOVERED THE SIMILAR FREQUENCIES/RESONANCES WITH YOU... THIS LED TO SHARING OF STORIES AND CONNECTING ETC... IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT SHE FOUND HER NEXT PROJECT OF SAVING SOMEONE, IN IMAGINING HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU... LIKE A "POTENTIAL BACKUP" IN CASE IT DOESN'T WORK WITH HER EX... YOU CAN CONNECT WITH YOUR SHARING IN THE NEXT PART THAT THE WAY YOU BOTH TALK MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE LOVERS BUT FOR HER THIS IS HER WAY OF TAKING CARE OF OTHERS... AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO REALIZE ALSO THAT BEHIND HOMOSEXUALITY, THERE ARE DEEP MEMORIES OF HURT, AS YOU HAVE MENTIONED WELL... WHERE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OTHER POLARITY HAS BEEN VERY SUFFERING... AND FOR A WOMAN, THIS CREATES A FEAR AND REJECTION OF THE MASCULINE, BECAUSE OF AN IMMENSE NEED FOR THE FEMININE ENERGY, THE TENDERNESS, KINDNESS OF ANOTHER WOMAN... BUT AS A COMPENSATION FOR HURT INSIDE... EVEN IF OF COURSE WE CAN HAVE WONDERFUL QUALITIES IF WE ARE HOMOSEXUAL, WE HAVE DEEP WOUNDS AT THE COUPLE / RELATIONAL LEVEL THAT WE NEED TO HEAL IN OUR SOUL, SO AS TO REPROGRAM OUR POLARITIES WELL... AND YOU CAN SEE A % OF THIS ENERGY IN YOUR LAST DREAM WHERE YOU DIDN'T ATTEND TO THE MARRIAGE OF YOUR FRIEND... WHERE THE MARRIAGE BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN IS SOMETHING DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO CONNECT WITH... In the meantime, we still maintain our daily conversation. And I realized it wasn't right. The way we talk makes me feel like lovers, and I don't think I should. I shared this with Thuong and Thuong said it was her way of taking care of the people around her, which is very normal for her. And I gradually realized that she cared too much about others so that they always felt they were special to Thuong, and Thuong did it unconsciously because of the hurt from the past, from the family, from many lifetimes causing her to both lack love inside and want to give love to outsiders too much. IT IS GOOD THAT YOU SAID THIS TO HER NHU... INDEED IT IS TOO CLOSE TO CHAT WITH SOMEONE IN PRIVATE IF THEY ARE IN A COUPLE AND WE FEEL SOMETHING FOR THEM... WHENEVER THERE IS TOO MUCH ON THE OUTSIDE, IT IS BECAUSE SHE LACKS THE SAME FROM WITHIN... SO WHILE CARING FOR OTHERS SHE IS SEEKING CARE, IMPORTANCE AND FEELING OF BELONGING. And I asked the universe with Angel Omael: how should I change this relationship? WONDERFUL INTENTION DEAR NHU Last night, before I had the dream, I texted Thuong, and she replied with a text message, then she took it back asap and I hadn't read it yet. Normally, we chat via Zalo (a chat application in Vietnam), but that message we texted via Messenger (it's a while since we didn't chat on this application). Here is the dream: I dreamed that Thuong's WITH YOUR SHARING ABOVE, WE ALSO SEE YOUR INNER THUONG REPRESENTS % ACCUMULATED UNCLEANSED MEMORIES OF DISTORTED, TRAUMATIZING LOVE EXPERIENCE WITH RESPECT TO THE COUPLE RELATION, % MEMORIES OF IMBALANCE IN EMISSIVITY AND RECEPTIVITY, % MEMORIES AS YOU HAVE ALSO MENTIONED ABOVE FOR THE EX-LOVER THAT HAS CREATED AFFINITIES TOWARDS FEMININE POLARITY AND REJECTING THE MASCULINE POLARITY IN THIS LIFE-TIME.... SO AS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE INTENSE LACK OF SOFTNESS, GENTLENESS THAT WERE EXPERIENCED OVER MANY PAST-LIVES AND WERE NOT WORKED UPON/TRANSFORMED... last message [- communication in words and by reading, without the presence of sound, tone of voice, so it will be missing a nuance in the communication. The minus points are difficulties in communication: verbal expression or use of words, misunderstanding of communication content, lack of logic in conveyed content YES, WELL SEEN... SO IT IS ALSO A SORT OF IMPERSONAL COMMUNICATION WHICH CAN MASK/HIDE THE TRUE INTENTIONS OR FEELINGS OF THE SENDER OF THE MESSAGE.... ] was: Thuong confessed to me. The first sentence: Thuong likes me, and after her message, she also sent another video [- the transmission of content, visual and audio messages, used for dissemination or storage. The minus point is the illusion, the excessive and unrealistic imagination, that lives in old memories ] . After watching it, I felt touched and happy because Thuong seemed to have feelings for me and had the same thoughts as me. I was delusional about my own instinct needs and desires so much that I would like to make them come true. DEAR NHU, WE INVITE YOU TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON YOUR RESONANCES OF INNER THUONG (AND EVEN HER EX-LOVER SINCE YOU KNOW HER AND SHE WILL ALSO REPRESENT % MEMORIES OF INNER WORLD OF MEMORIES THAT HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO INTENSE LACK OF LOVE AND AFFECTION IN THE PAST- LIVES...) SO THAT ONE DAY, YOU COULD EVENTUALLY FIRST DEVELOP A COMFORTING SENSE OF SELF-LOVE SO THAT IT MANIFESTS IN ALL YOUR RELATIONSHIPS AND AFFINITIES... BECAUSE HERE YOU SEE ALSO AN UNCONSCIOUS DESIRE THAT SHE LOVES YOU IN RETURN... AND IT SHOWS THAT YOU MAY HAVE CREATED TOO MUCH PROXIMITY WITH HER CONCRETELY AS WELL... BUT GETTING CLOSE TO SOMEONE VIA TEXT MESSAGE IS OFTEN AN ILLUSION OF CLOSENESS... AND IT CAN NOURISH AFFECTIVE LACKS BEYOND, BECAUSE THE LOVE BECOMES TOO VIRTUAL, NOT CONCRETE ENOUGH... BECAUSE BEHIND THE SCREEN OF A PHONE THERE CAN BE ANYONE... YOU CAN HIDE WHATEVER YOU WANT THROUGH CHAT... AND A 18 YEARS OLD WOMAN CAN BE IN REALITY A 45 YEARS OLD MAN... SO YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU CHAT WITH PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET... BECAUSE YOU CAN ATTRACT ALL SORTS OF DIFFICULT RELATIONSHIPS IF YOU ARE NOT VIGILANT... THIS IS WHY IT IS BETTER TO MEET THE PERSON IN THE CONCRETE FIRST, AND EVENTUALLY WE CAN CHAT AFTER THAT... INSTEAD OF BEING TOO CLOSE THROUGH THE CHAT DIRECTLY... IN THIS CASE IT IS MORE A NEED FOR CLOSENESS, AFFECTIVE PRESENCE, BUT WITHOUT CONNECTING TRULY TO EACH OTHER CONCRETELY... A LOVE THAT IS TOO ABSTRACT, VIRTUAL, ILLUSIONAL... The next day when I woke up, I shared the video with a few close friends [- These are close friends who have high trust, are rational persons, have a general vision and are not carried away by emotions inside the story SINCE THIS IS A NEGATIVE DREAM, HERE IT WILL REVEAL THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF INNER FRIENDS WHO SOMETIMES COULD BE EXCESSIVELY COLLECTIVE, SOCIAL IN YOUR WISH TO 19/08/2025, 21:41 A new friend | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/99756 2/3 SHARE, BECAUSE IF YOU SHOW IT TO YOUR FRIENDS IT IS LIKE IF YOU WANTED TO NOURISH FROM THEIR ATTENTION... ] . I just said that a person sent this video to me. Friends don't know who this person is and they just casually say: ah this video is very popular on TikTok now. At that moment, I am surprised, sad and disappointed. Intellectually and with inner wisdom I still realize that these parts of the illusion are not real and that Thuong didn't mean anything special to me even though she sent this video. YES... AND IF SHE POSTED IT ON TIKTOK YOU SEE ALSO THE COLLECTIVE NEEDS FOR LOVE THAT WE CAN FIND ON THIS PLATFORM, WHERE PEOPLE WILL BE READY TO DO ANYTHING TO BE LOVED, APPRECIATED BY OTHERS... A % THAT YOU HAVE IN YOU ALSO, AND THAT IS PRESENT IN THE NEW YOUNG GENERATIONS... Yesterday, I thought this video was made by Thuong for me. I thought Thuong had the same thoughts as me, but I realized: Thuong seems to just send it for fun. And I wondered if Thuong had to think the same way as me and I thought it was probably not. IN THIS PART YOU UNDERSTAND % ASPECTS OF MEMORIES OF MANIPULATION, SELF-CENTEREDNESS AND SELFISHNESS THAT COULD SOMETIMES DISREGARD OTHER PEOPLE'S EMOTIONS WHICH COULD CREATE MEMORIES OF DEEP HURTS AND WOUNDS... COMPLICATED GAMES IN COMMUNICATION THAT CAN CREATE NOTIONS OF "I WANT - I DON'T WANT"... PLAYING HIDE-AND-SEEK BEHIND THE PHONE IN A WAY... However, there is still a very small percentage that Thuong also has feelings for me that is, before the video, she sent a clear message. However, it ended up being only a very small percentage that gave me grounds to think my delusions were real. And what I've always told myself, I'm resonating with Thuong on so many levels. Her distortions are also the deforms that I need to cleanse.A VERY BEAUTIFUL REALIZATION... I was surprised when the Universe allowed me to meet someone with a family background similar to mine, and also with similar thoughts or perspectives. It's just that she hasn't gone too deep into spirituality. EVERYBODY LEARNS, GROWS AND EVOLVE AT THEIR PACE EITHER THROUGH THE SCHOOL OF CAUSES OR CONSEQUENCES... ONE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE LOVE AND COMPASSION FOR EVERYONE AND ALSO HAVE DEEP RESPECT FOR ONE'S CHOICE OF SPIRITUAL PATH.... AND IT IS ALWAYS VERY IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO REFER BACK TO SELF, TO BE ABLE TO TAKE YOUR LEARNINGS IN THE LIGHT OF SYMBOLIC LANGUAGE... YOU CAN ALSO CONTINUE TO WORK ON YOUR MEMORIES AND RESONANCE WITH HOMOSEXUALITY... BECAUSE HERE BEING ON AN LGBT COMMUNITY ON FACEBOOK WILL ALSO MAKE YOU ENTER IN CONTACT WITH PEOPLE WHO WILL HAVE THE SAME RESONANCE... AND OF COURSE WE RESPECT EVERYONE'S CHOICE AT UCM... OVER THE YEARS WE HAD STUDENTS WHO ARE HOMOSEXUAL AND WE RESPECT THEM WITH ALL OUR HEART, BECAUSE THEY CAN BE WONDERFUL PEOPLE... BUT WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF SYMBOLIC LANGUAGE, WE UNDERSTAND TRULY THE NOTION OF POLARITIES, AND THAT BEHIND THIS CHOICE, THERE ARE ALSO MEMORIES OF HURT, OF DEPOLARIZATION... AND BY WORKING ON OUR MEMORIES, WE CAN ALSO UNDERSTAND AND REALIZE HOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN CAN ALSO BECOME WONDERFUL IN TERMS OF QUALITIES, OF POSSIBILITIES OF LIFE AND HAPPINESS... BECAUSE THEY ARE ABLE TO CONCEIVE A CHILD THROUGH THEIR LOVE, BUILD ALSO A FAMILY LIFE THAT CAN BRING THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF HAPPINESS AND WISDOM... AND THE FUSION OF THE POLARITIES NEEDS TO BE DONE INSIDE OF US FIRST... HOW WE LOVE OURSELVES, OUR INNER WORLD... AND IF WE MANAGE TO HEAL THESE MEMORIES IN DEPTH, WE CAN EVEN REPROGRAM OUR ATTRACTION TO THE OTHER POLARITY ONE DAY, IN A VERY NATURAL AND HEALTHY WAY... 🌟 ANGELIC FUSION AND UNIFICATION IN YOUR INNER AND OUTER COUPLE WITH THE RIGHT EMISSIVITY AND RECEPTIVITY... IN THE LIGHT OF ANGEL PAHALIAH AND ANGEL MIHAEL ANGELIC BLESSINGS ALEXIS

title_pdf: The lesbian couple and me. last case id: C0210. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 2 September 2022 Angel: 32 Vasariah Dream and Analysis: Angelic Hello Professor ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU I live in the same house with many older sisters [- parts of my feminine, representing receptivity. The older sisters represent that I am opening up to my receptivity, my feminine with a more mature attitude ] INDICATION THAT IN THIS DREAM YOU ARE CONNECTING WITH MEMORIES RELATED TO CERTAIN AFFINITIES IN YOUR WORLD OF EMOTIONS (SISTERS) WHICH ARE A PART OF YOUR INNER STRUCTURE, INTIMACY (HOUSE)... ALSO NOTIONS OF 'MANY' DEPICTS LACK OF BALANCE, TOO MUCH OF SOMETHING IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE FOR A LACK... IN THIS CASE MANY OLDER SISTERS LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE REPRESENT TOO MUCH NEED FOR A FEMININE PRESENCE IN YOUR INTIMACY, WHICH REVEALS A LACK OF EMOTIONS, TENDERNESS, SWEETNESS IN YOU AT TIMES... . That night I.E. UNCONSCIOUS ASPECTS, there was a party [- represents development and connection at the social level. The minus points are lack of connection with external parts, lack of recognition, tendency to rest too much, laziness ALSO NOTIONS OF ESCAPISM, BEING TOO EXTERNALIZED TO COMPENSATE FOR INNER LACKS, LOOKING FOR SENSATIONS ETC. SOCIALIZATION WHICH CAN SOMETIMES BE DRIVEN BY NEEDS ] invited by our partner. I was specially invited, but I declined DIPLOMACY IS A WONDERFUL SPIRITUAL QUALITY DEAR NHU... YOU SEE YOU ARE BEING SPECIALLY INVITED BUT YOU STILL DECLINE... THIS COULD BE OK OF COURSE IF YOU HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO DO, BUT BECAUSE THERE IS A RESONANCE IN YOU (DON'T LIKE SOCIAL GATHERINGS), THIS IS MORE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE... AND CAN TRIGGER RESENTMENT, LACK OF RESPECT IN OTHERS. YOU CAN APPEAR TO BE TOO SELF-CENTERED OR EGOISTIC IN THE EYES OF OTHERS, BECAUSE THERE IS A LITTLE MONK ATTITUDE BEHIND THIS... :) EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE PARTIES, THERE IS NOTHING WRONG TO TAKE OUT TIME TO EXTEND YOUR THANK YOU TO THE HOST (INCASE YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO MAKE IT) OR IF IT IS FEASIBLE, TO VISIT THE GATHERING FOR SOMETIME AND COME BACK EARLY (INSTEAD OF WAITING TILL THE END)... SO IT SHOWS A TENDENCY TO BE SOMETIMES TOO INTERNALIZED, A PART OF YOU WHICH IS TOO FOCUSSED ON CONVENIENCE/COMFORT FOR SELF LIKE A MONK IN A WAY... WHILE PARTYING TOO MUCH IS AN EXTREME BUT IT IS OK TO SOCIALIZE ONCE IN A WHILE AND CONNECT WITH PEOPLE WITH AUTHENTICITY because I don't like social gatherings, crowded REJECTING MULTIPLE PARTS OF YOU IN THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS... THIS CAN ALSO BE AT TIMES DUE TO COMPLEX OF SUPERIORITY AND INFERIORITY and I don't like dressing up [- represents the aura that manifests outwardly. The minus point is that they are too materialistic, have too much instinctive energy, tend to brag too much, do not know how to express themselves properly NOT LIKE DRESSING UP ON THE MINUS CAN MEAN NOTIONS OF BEING CASUAL, LAZY BEHAVIOR, TENDENCY TO BE TOO INTERNALIZED, SHYNESS, NOT CARING MUCH FOR YOUR SOCIAL AURA I.E. THE WAY YOU PERCIEVE OTHERS OR THE WAY YOU ARE BEING PERCIEVED BY OTHERS. WHILE IT IS OK TO NOT BE EXTRAVAGANT AND BEING TOO MUCH INTO APPEARANCES BUT THE OTHER EXTREME IS ALSO NOT RIGHT. ONE SHOULD ALWAYS BE PRESENTABLE, CAN WEAR GOOD YET SIMPLE CLOTHES, SMELL GOOD AND APPEAR NICE ETC... NOT CARING MUCH FOR THIS CAN ALSO MEAN TENDENCY TO BE A BIT AIRY SOMETIMES... AND MOST OF THE TIME WHEN WE DON'T LIKE TO GET DRESSED IT MEANS WE HAVE MEMORIES IN US WHERE DRESSING AND LOOKING GOOD WAS TOO IMPORTANT... ] and going to party. It's a bit cumbersome, and I also have little clothes to wear to these parties. Except for me, everyone goes to the party. They wear clothes to go because it's pretty luxurious. They convinced me a lot so I finally went. I usually only have 1 or 2 simple dresses, so I wear them and wait for everyone to get ready. Everyone is divided into different groups to go to the party. SIMPLE IS GOOD DEAR NHU ... BUT HERE YOU ARE BEING COAXED AND FORCED TO DO IT... THIS ALSO REVEALS THAT UNCONSCIOUSLY YOU CAN SOMETIMES SEEK ATTENTION AND HAVING FORCES THAT SAY "NO" AND "YES" AT THE SAME TIME, BECAUSE OF AFFECTIVE NEEDS FOR THE PRESENCE OF OTHERS BEYOND... THIS IS WHY YOU ARE LIVING WITH MANY PEOPLE IN THE SAME HOUSE... THERE ARE AFFECTIVE NEEDS FOR THE FEMININE ENERGY BEYOND... ITS LIKE HOW PEOPLE WANT TO BE A PART OF OF A GROUP OR A PARTY BUT ARE WAITING FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO COAX OR ASK THEM TO JOIN SO AS TO GAIN SOME IMPORTANCE IN FRONT OF OTHERS. I lack receptivity on a social level, lack the ability to express myself properly, and may have been too receptive or too easily without knowing what is right for me. At the same time, it also shows the energy of wanting to be the center, wanting attention from everyone. WELL PERCEIVED NHU... IN THIS PART OF THE DREAM IT IS BEING SHOWN TO YOU WHAT HAPPENS WITHIN YOU (UNCONSCIOUSLY) WHEN YOU ENTER THE DYNAMICS OF SOCIALIZATION, PARTY ETC... THERE IS A PART OF YOU WHICH IS TOO RESERVED, DOES NOT LIKE TO SOCIALIZE AND HAS TO BE COAXED OR FORCED TO DO SO. ALSO NOTIONS OF LACKING ENOUGH DIPLOMACY SO AS TO NOT TRIGGER NEGATIVITY AMONGTS OTHERS. THIS CAN MAKE MANY PEOPLE MISUNDERSTAND YOU. LET US NOW SEE WHAT HAPPENS FURTHER ONCE YOU ENTER SOCIAL DYNAMICS I went with 2 SYMBOLIZING ASPECTS IN RELATION TO YOUR SOCIAL DIMENSION... I.E. WHEN YOU CONNECT WITH THIS DYNAMIC...IT CAN TRIGGER TOO MUCH EMOTIONAL NEEDS IN YOU. THIS IS ALSO THE REASON WHY YOU LIKE TO STAY AWAY FROM PARTIES BUT THAT DOES NOT LEAD TO CLEANSING OF THESE MEMORIES. ON THE CONTRARY YOU MIGHT END UP REPRESSING THEM MORE. older sisters (I don't know them in reality PARTS OF YOUR UNCONSCIOUS WHICH ARE BEING REVEALED IN THIS DREAM, I'll call them Jane [- a feminine, gentle, well-groomed person, like to take care of people around, kind. Her minus is that she lacks care for herself ] and Lucy [- a gentle person, very strong, capable of protecting those she loves. Her minus point is that she lacks receptivity, masculine polarity shows a lot on the outside, lacks sensitivity ] temporarily). These two are a happy couple IT SHOULD BE NOTED HERE THAT 2 SISTERS ARE ALSO A HAPPY COUPLE. THIS REPRESENTS NOTIONS OF INCEST, IMBALANCE OF POLARITIES, MEMORIES OF WRONG SEXUALITY IN YOUR EMOTIONAL DOMAIN - I.E. DRIVEN BY TOO MUCH EMOTIONAL NEEDS, LACK OF DISCERNMENT, BEING TOO SELF-CENTERED OWING TO NEEDS, MEMORIES OF EXCESSIVE EMOTIONAL LACKS, DIFFICULTY TO MANIFEST/MATERIALIZE ETC. ALSO YOU MENTIONED THE TERM 'HAPPY COUPLE' - WHILE IT IS A WONDERFUL QUALITY TO HAVE GOOD ADJUSTMENT, UNDERSTANDING, HAPPINESS ETC. BUT AS YOU NOW KNOW... SYMBOLICALLY FOR THE COUPLE MENTIONED IN THIS DREAM, IT DENOTES LACK OF BALANCE IN MASCULINE AND FEMININE POLARITIES... HENCE THE HAPPINESS CAN BE ILLUSORY AND CAN SOMETIMES BE DERIVED FROM NEEDS TO FULFILL INER LACKS, TENDENCY TO BE FOCUSSED ON SELF ETC. AND A LESBIAN COUPLE REPRESENTS ALSO IN THE NEGATIVE A REJECTION OF THE MASCULINE POLARITY, WITH DEEP NEEDS FOR FEMININE QUALITIES OF LOVE, TENDERNESS, SWEETNESS... SOME ENERGIES YOU COULD DEVELOP WHEN YOU ARE IN THIS SOCIAL DYNAMIC WHERE YOU FEEL FORCED TO GO TO THE PARTY... . Flooded fields [- the field represents the basic source of energy, the flooded field represents the feeling that has filled in receiving and creating energy to nourish me. The minus is being too emotional and lacking wisdom I.E. TOO MUCH EMOTIONS THEREHBY SUBMERGING THE ASPECTS RELATED TO MATTER, ACTION ETC. (FIELDS) HENCE DEPLETING THE CAPACITY TO MATERIALIZE... JUST LIKE WHEN THERE ARE TOO MANY WOMEN IN THE HOUSE YOU LIVE IN... IT CREATES THE "TOO MUCH" OF THE EMOTIONAL ASPECT OF THE FEMININE POLARITY... ] surround the house we live in, so the road to the house is made of dirt and not too wide THIS ALSO CAN CAUSE INFERIORITY COMPLEX IN YOUR ADVANCEMENT. The way I move forward in a society that lacks wisdom, is overwhelmed by emotions, makes it difficult for me to express myself and move forward. The way I move forward is currently built by too much receptivity (3 women), imbalance, and lack of emissivity from masculine polarity. VERY GOOD UNDERSTANDING... ALSO PLEASE CONNECT WITH THE COMMENTS ABOVE While the 3 of us were going out, we were joking about something and I slowly walked to the edge of the road, right next to the edge of the field. THIS THEME CONTINUES FROM YOUR EARLIER DREAMS...YOU GENEREALLY SEE YOURSELF PLACED AWAY, AT A DISTANCE FROM OTHERS... HERE ALSO YOU ARE AT THE EDGE OF THE ROAD... EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE JOKING... YOU ARE KEEPING A DISTANCE FROM YOUR INNER SISTERS/COUPLE (AS DECODED ABOVE)... AT TIMES THIS DISTANCE BECOMES SO MUCH SO THAT IT CAUSES IMBALANCE IN YOU Jane saw that and went over and was about to catch me, but in the end, I was able to step back inside so I was okay. And when Jane 19/08/2025, 21:41 The lesbian couple and me | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/100105 2/4 went to help me, she lost her momentum and fell into the field. A PART OF YOU WHICH IS TOO SENSITIVE AND CAN SOMETIMES BECOME OVER-PROTECTIVE FOR YOUR EMOTIONAL NEEDS THEREBY MAKING IT SUSCEPTIBLE TO HURTS This over-receptiveness has made it difficult for me and even predisposed to or think to eliminate feminine polarity. Since the fields are not deep, I think Jane will be fine. Both me and Lucy stood there and waited for Jane to get up. But after a few seconds, the two of us saw that Jane did not move, so we both rushed in and pulled Jane up. While in the field, Jane was lying on her back. ANOTHER PART OF YOU WHICH TENDS TO HIDE ITS EMOTIONAL SIDE, SENSITIVITY ETC. AND IS RESISTANT TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE HELP TO YOU INNER SENSITIVE/OVER-PROTECTIVE JANE...THINKING THAT IT WILL GET UP ON ITS OWN... THIS IS HOW SOMETIMES PEOPLE REPRESS OR DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THEIR EMOTIONAL HURTS THINKING THAT IT WILL BECOME OK ON ITS OWN WITH TIME...BUT THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT APPROACH. THIS TENDENCY OF KEEPING A DISTANCE IS NOT HELPING YOU HERE DEAR NHU... IT IS IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND WORK TOWARDS IT... LATER WHEN YOU AND YOUR INNER LUCY (WHO IS APPEARS TO BE STRONGER) NOTICE THAT IT IS AN EMERGENCY SITUATION THEN YOU GET IN ACTION...THIS MEANS THAT YOU TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION ONLY WHEN YOU FEEL THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION LEFT... AT THE LAST MOMENT WHEN THIS PROBLEM BECOMES TOO BIG...IN A WAY YOU WERE FORCED TO ACT...THIS IS AN IMPORTANT REVELATION DEAR NHU...THIS DREAM IS TELLING YOU THAT IF YOU DON'T WORK ON THIS TENDENCY OF DISTANCING YOURSELF... THEN THE REPRESSIONS, CONFUSIONS ETC. WILL BECOME TOO STRONG THEREBY CAUSING IMBALANCE IN YOU ... THEN YOU WILL BE FORCED TO TAKE ACTION TO SAVE YOUR INNER JANE...THIS CAN ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT YOUR ADVANCEMENT (AS YOU WERE ON A ROAD) After pulling Jane up, the two of us patted her back and shook Jane up. Luckily, Jane choked on the water and woke up. At that moment, I think maybe the situation just was really dangerous. Lucy looked at her girlfriend, then she apologized and asked if Jane was okay. Jane very calmly said she was okay. To my surprise, Jane turned around and asked if I was okay. I said it's okay and thank you so much to Jane, Jane made me worry a lot. After that, because Jane got all wet, we decided not to go to the party anymore, but to have dinner somewhere else. THIS MEANS THAT THERE IS STILL A POSSIBILITY TO REVIVE AND SAVE YOU INNER JANE... YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL POTENTIAL TO TAKE THE RIGHT STEPS AND ACTIVATE THE RIGHT QUALITIES OF YOUR INNER JANE SYMBOL (WHICH CURRENTLY IS IN THE UNCONSCIOUS)... WHEN JANE IS OK, YOU DECIDE NOT GO TO PARTY... THIS MEANS THAT WHEN YOU FEEL EMOTIONALLY BALANCED THEN THERE WILL BE NO NEED FOR YOU TO COMPENSATE FOR INNER LACKS THROUGH EXTERNAL MEANS LIKE PARTY, GATHERING ETC. Emotions are having an impact on what I do, act, and behave socially and personally. I lack the wisdom to see things clearly. I have decided to make it clear to Thuong (the girl I mentioned in my dream last week) again about the way we talk. I asked her to stop caring about me, and I sensed that this could be seen as the end of our relationship. And I accept that. I think if the way I communicate with her is wrong, I need to fix it but if it's only from one side of me it's very difficult to change, and she continues to care about me as before. There was a time when I avoided communicating with Thuong, but I don't think it's a good way either. So even if this action leads to the end of the relationship, I think it should be. Because Thuong has activated the lack of love in me too much, I need to go back to my inner to work and cleanse. THUONG SYMBOLIZES A PART OF YOU WHICH TAKES CARE OF OTHERS AS A MECHANISM TO FULFILL HER OWN INNER LACKS OF LOVE, MEMORIES OF ABANDONMENT ETC... SO IN A WAY HER TAKING CARE IS DRIVEN BY HER NEEDS. SINCE THIS WAS BOTHERING YOU IT IS A GOOD THING TO AFFIRM AND TALK OPENLY ABOUT WHAT YOU FEEL IS RIGHT. HOWEVER, WE SUGGEST TO BE DIPLOMATIC AND NOT BE EXTREME IN THE WAY YOU APPROACH THIS... YOU CAN ALSO FOCUS ON CLEANSING THE RESONANCES THAT THUONG REPRESENTS... MEDITATE ON WHY YOU ATTRACTED THUONG IN YOUR LIFE AND WHAT IS IT THAT NEEDS TO BE LEARNT. IT IS OK TO HAVE SOME DISTANCE FOR THE TIME BEING BUT ALSO NOTE THAT REJECTING HER WILL NOT CLEANSE THE RESONANCES IN YOU...IT IS GOOD TO BE SENSITIVE, EMPATHETIC TOWARDS OTHERS BUT ONLY WHEN IT IS BALANCED, AUTHENTIC AND NOT DRIVEN BY INNER LACKS OR REJECTION... MUCH LIKE HOW YOU CAN WORK ON YOURSELF TO BALANCE AND CLEANSE THE MEMORIES RELATED TO THE SYMBOL OF YOUR INNER JANE (DECODED ABOVE). OF COURSE THIS DREAM IS JUST A % OF YOURSELF AND DOESN'T REMOVE ALL YOUR INITIATE QUALITIES... IT IS A DREAM TO HELP YOU RE-BALANCE YOUR POLARITIES INSIDE OF YOU, NOT TO NEED TOO MANY EMOTIONS ON THE OUTSIDE THROUGH THE PRESENCE OF OTHERS... AND BE ABLE TO SUPPORT AND HELP YOURSELF THE RIGHT WAY WHEN EMOTIONS BECOME TOO STRONG... TO REPLACE THEM WITH THE BEAUTIFUL TOOLS YOU HAVE NOW 🌟😇 WE WISHING ANGELIC REVELATIONS AND TRANSFORMATIONS IN YOU WITH ANGELS MIHAEL AND JELIEL ANGELIC REGARDS ALEXIS

title_pdf: 2 female prisoners. last case id: C0211. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 9 September 2022 Angel: 33 Yehuiah Dream and Analysis: Angelic Hello professor ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU, My intention this week when working with angel Yehuiah: please help me understand the right subordination. WONDERFUL INTENTION...RIGHT SURRENDER AND ACCEPTANCE TO THE DIVINE PLAN PAVES THE PATH TOWARDS SPIRITUAL EVOLUTION Dream: There was a young girl named Emma [- she is a PART OF YOUR FEMININE POLARITY WHICH IS girly, cute, funny, strong personality. Inside she lacks of love, lacks of recognition. She is rebellious, careless, and imbalanced between the two polarities. ] (I don't remember her English name, but it's an English name). She was imprisoned [- lack of proper understanding of the right, disobedience to the law, lack of discipline, rebelliousness, lack of justice within oneself ALSO MEMORIES OF RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS, ABUSE OF AUTHORITY & POWER, DIFFICULTY TO INTEGRATE THE LAW OF RETURN THAT WE REAP WHAT WE SOW, LACK OF INTROSPECTION, REFLECTION ON ONE'S ACTION ] and she was locked up with an older woman [- a mature, gentle woman ANOTHER PART OF YOUR FEMININE POLARITY who has experienced many storms in life, has great tolerance, forgiveness, listening, and unconditional love. Her minus point is that she is too responsible, too weak, and lacks understanding of the right DIFFICULTY TO LEARN FROM PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES, LACK OF DISCERNMENT AND WISDOM ] . This woman has been in prison for 2 years DEPICTS THE RELATIONAL ASPECT (ANGEL 2)...AS THE STARTING SCENE DEPICTS, YOU HAVE VISITED MEMORIES RELATED TO IMPRISONMENT...THIS CAN BE SYMBOLIC AS WELL, ITS LIKE HOW YOU CAN FEEL STUCK OR RESTRICTED AT AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL AS WELL (SYMBOLS OF 2 WOMEN BEING SHOWN HERE)...IT ALSO DEPICTS YOUR AFFINITIES TOWARDS ASPECTS RELATED TO YOUR INNER EMMA WHO LACKS LOVE, RECOGNITION AND CAN BE REBELLIOUS AS WELL AS WITH THAT OF THE OLDER WOMAN SYMBOL AS WELL WHICH DEPICTS LACK OF WISDOM, DISCERNMENT ETC.. The two women embody a part of my femininity, and the distortions that I resonate with them are lack of understanding of the right, lack of recognition, lack of discipline, imbalance between the two polarities. YES AND ALSO A STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN YOUR EMOTIONS THAT CONNECTS WITH NOTIONS OF IMPRISONMENT WHERE YOU COULD RESTRICT YOUR EMOTIONS TO MANIFEST TOO MUCH SOMETIMES... The two met and they fell in love DEPICTS NOTIONS OF HOMOSEXUALITY/LESBIAN ASPECT I.E. TOO MUCH EMOTIONAL NEEDS IN YOU, EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES...PERCENTAGES (AS MENTIONED FOR THESE SYMBOLS ABOVE) THAT CAN SOMETIMES LEAD TO DUALITY OR CONFUSIONS...LOVE WHICH DRIVEN BY NEEDS. IN CONNECTION WITH MEMORIES OF PROBLEMS WITH THE MASCULINE POLARITY IN THE INTIMACY... THE TOO MUCH OF FEMININE THAT BECOMES A REJECT OF THE MASCULINE ENERGY... They've been together for 5 years [- Angel 5 - Mahasiah is the Angel of rectification of mistakes. The minus are difficulty in rectifying, repairing, acknowledging and regretting mistakes or forgiving the mistakes of others ] in prison, and it's as if they've been through a lot together and can confide in everything in the world. REFLECTS YOUR EMOTIONAL NEEDS TO SHARE, CONFIDE AND EXPERIENCE A BONDING OF TRUST... HOWEVER, WANTING TOO MUCH OF IT ON THE INSIDE CAN CREATE DIFFICULTIES FOR YOU ON THE OUTSIDE... TO COMPENSATE FOR THE INNER LACKS... ALSO IT TRIGGERS ESCAPISM AS CAN BE SEEN IN THE NEXT PART OF THE DREAM... AND YOU SEE IN THIS DREAM THAT IT IS WHEN YOU REPRESS YOUR EMOTIONS TOO MUCH THAT YOU CAN DEVELOP A LESBIAN %... BECAUSE IF WE KEEP EVERYTHING INSIDE AND BECOME HARSH WITH OURSELVES, WE CAN NEED FEMININE PRESENCE AND ENERGY ON THE OUTSIDE TOO MUCH ALSO, AS A COMPENSATION... prison, they meet other inmates and spend days socializing with them. The prison space is quite comfortable, it's like a small bamboo house on the mountain overlooking the valley, surrounded by many trees, grass, and open space. I didn't see the guards, I felt like they were in a resting place, it's just that they weren't allowed to go out. THE DESCRIPTION OF PRISON WITH MOUNTAIN, GRASS, TREES ETC. IS REFLECTION OF A % OF INNER DUALITIES IN YOU DEAR NHU...PERCENTAGES OF ESCAPISM, NOT WANTING TO FACE SITUATIONS IN CONCRETE LIFE MAKES YOU SEEK SOLACE AND COMFORT EVEN WHEN THERE IS LACK OF FREEDOM, TOO MUCH RESTRICTIONS, LIMITATIONS ESPECIALLY AT AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL... AND YOU GET TOO MUCH COMFORTABLE IN YOUR PRISON HERE... THER IS NOT ENOUGH REFLECTIONS ON WHAT HAS TO BE TRANSFORMED, LEARN FROM THE CONSEQUENCES.... RESISTANCE TO CHANGE AND YOUR INNER FEARS, LACKS CAN MAKE YOU FEEL OK WITH NEGATIVITY... THEREBY CAUSING DISCOURAGEMENT OR LACK OF MOTIVATION IN YOU TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. USING YOUR INNER PRISON AS MECHANISM TO ESCAPE FROM YOUR PROBLEMS... CAN ALSO GIVE RISE TO EMOTIONAL FRAGILITY, VICTIMHOOD ETC... ABSENCE OF GUARDS, CONSIDERING IT TO BE RESTING PLACE DEPICTS TOO MUCH PASSIVITY, LACK OF PROTECTION AND ALERTNESS IN YOUR EMOTIONAL WORLD DEAR NHU... LACK OF A JOY OR SPARK IN WAY YOU FEEL WHICH CAN LEAD TO MORE PESSIMISM AND CAN DILUTE THE JOY OF LIVING... IT SEEMS THAT THESE PARTS OF YOU ARE ENJOYING THE STAY IN PRISON - BEING TOO SELF ABSORBED IN YOUR OWN EMOTIONS WHICH CAN MAKE YOU SELFISH AND THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN SELF... ALSO NOTIONS OF SOCIALIZING MEAINS THAT YOU HAVE UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES WHERE YOU SEEM TO LIKE THIS SITUATION... ITS LIKE HOW SOMETIMES PEOPLE UNCONSCIOULY TEND TO REMAIN IN DIFFICULTIES SO THAT THEY CAN COMPLAIN, FEEL VICTIMIZED, SEEK ATTENTION, SYMPATHY AND LOVE FROM OTHERS... THIS CAN STOP YOU FROM BEING DETACHED AND CAN BLOCK YOUR CAPACITY TO REFLECT BACK ON YOURSELF IN AN UNBIASED WAY SO TO BECOME BETTER... AND IN A WAY IT IS LIKE BEING IN A "GOLDEN PRISON" HERE... BECAUSE YOUR INNER EMMA IS HAPPY IN HER RELATIONSHIP, BUT SHE CAN'T GO TO WORK, OR HAVE A STABLE LIFE... SO THIS SHOWS YOU COULD ALSO SOMETIMES PUT YOURSELF IN A LIMITATIVE SITUATION AT THE AFFECTIVE LEVEL, FEELING GOOD ABOUT IT, BUT WITHOUT REALIZING THAT YOU ARE CREATING YOURSELF LIMITATIONS... IT IS LIKE THE FACT OF BEING IN A COUPLE WITH A WOMAN...

    "dream_text": "There was a young girl named Emma [- she is a PART OF YOUR FEMININE POLARITY WHICH IS girly, cute, funny, strong personality. Inside she lacks of love, lacks of recognition. She is rebellious, careless, and imbalanced between the two polarities. ] (I don't remember her English name, but it's an English name). She was imprisoned [- lack of proper understanding of the right, disobedience to the law, lack of discipline, rebelliousness, lack of justice within oneself ALSO MEMORIES OF RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS, ABUSE OF AUTHORITY & POWER, DIFFICULTY TO INTEGRATE THE LAW OF RETURN THAT WE REAP WHAT WE SOW, LACK OF INTROSPECTION, REFLECTION ON ONE'S ACTION ] and she was locked up with an older woman [- a mature, gentle woman ANOTHER PART OF YOUR FEMININE POLARITY who has experienced many storms in life, has great tolerance, forgiveness, listening, and unconditional love. Her minus point is that she is too responsible, too weak, and lacks understanding of the right DIFFICULTY TO LEARN FROM PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES, LACK OF DISCERNMENT AND WISDOM ] . This woman has been in prison for 2 years DEPICTS THE RELATIONAL ASPECT (ANGEL 2)...AS THE STARTING SCENE DEPICTS, YOU HAVE VISITED MEMORIES RELATED TO IMPRISONMENT...THIS CAN BE SYMBOLIC AS WELL, ITS LIKE HOW YOU CAN FEEL STUCK OR RESTRICTED AT AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL AS WELL (SYMBOLS OF 2 WOMEN BEING SHOWN HERE)...IT ALSO DEPICTS YOUR AFFINITIES TOWARDS ASPECTS RELATED TO YOUR INNER EMMA WHO LACKS LOVE, RECOGNITION AND CAN BE REBELLIOUS AS WELL AS WITH THAT OF THE OLDER WOMAN SYMBOL AS WELL WHICH DEPICTS LACK OF WISDOM, DISCERNMENT ETC.. The two women embody a part of my femininity, and the distortions that I resonate with them are lack of understanding of the right, lack of recognition, lack of discipline, imbalance between the two polarities. YES AND ALSO A STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN YOUR EMOTIONS THAT CONNECTS WITH NOTIONS OF IMPRISONMENT WHERE YOU COULD RESTRICT YOUR EMOTIONS TO MANIFEST TOO MUCH SOMETIMES... The two met and they fell in love DEPICTS NOTIONS OF HOMOSEXUALITY/LESBIAN ASPECT I.E. TOO MUCH EMOTIONAL NEEDS IN YOU, EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES...PERCENTAGES (AS MENTIONED FOR THESE SYMBOLS ABOVE) THAT CAN SOMETIMES LEAD TO DUALITY OR CONFUSIONS...LOVE WHICH DRIVEN BY NEEDS. IN CONNECTION WITH MEMORIES OF PROBLEMS WITH THE MASCULINE POLARITY IN THE INTIMACY... THE TOO MUCH OF FEMININE THAT BECOMES A REJECT OF THE MASCULINE ENERGY... They've been together for 5 years [- Angel 5 - Mahasiah is the Angel of rectification of mistakes. The minus are difficulty in rectifying, repairing, acknowledging and regretting mistakes or forgiving the mistakes of others ] in prison, and it's as if they've been through a lot together and can confide in everything in the world. REFLECTS YOUR EMOTIONAL NEEDS TO SHARE, CONFIDE AND EXPERIENCE A BONDING OF TRUST... HOWEVER, WANTING TOO MUCH OF IT ON THE INSIDE CAN CREATE DIFFICULTIES FOR YOU ON THE OUTSIDE... TO COMPENSATE FOR THE INNER LACKS... ALSO IT TRIGGERS ESCAPISM AS CAN BE SEEN IN THE NEXT PART OF THE DREAM... AND YOU SEE IN THIS DREAM THAT IT IS WHEN YOU REPRESS YOUR EMOTIONS TOO MUCH THAT YOU CAN DEVELOP A LESBIAN %... BECAUSE IF WE KEEP EVERYTHING INSIDE AND BECOME HARSH WITH OURSELVES, WE CAN NEED FEMININE PRESENCE AND ENERGY ON THE OUTSIDE TOO MUCH ALSO, AS A COMPENSATION... prison, they meet other inmates and spend days socializing with them. The prison space is quite comfortable, it's like a small bamboo house on the mountain overlooking the valley, surrounded by many trees, grass, and open space. I didn't see the guards, I felt like they were in a resting place, it's just that they weren't allowed to go out. THE DESCRIPTION OF PRISON WITH MOUNTAIN, GRASS, TREES ETC. IS REFLECTION OF A % OF INNER DUALITIES IN YOU DEAR NHU...PERCENTAGES OF ESCAPISM, NOT WANTING TO FACE SITUATIONS IN CONCRETE LIFE MAKES YOU SEEK SOLACE AND COMFORT EVEN WHEN THERE IS LACK OF FREEDOM, TOO MUCH RESTRICTIONS, LIMITATIONS ESPECIALLY AT AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL... AND YOU GET TOO MUCH COMFORTABLE IN YOUR PRISON HERE... THER IS NOT ENOUGH REFLECTIONS ON WHAT HAS TO BE TRANSFORMED, LEARN FROM THE CONSEQUENCES.... RESISTANCE TO CHANGE AND YOUR INNER FEARS, LACKS CAN MAKE YOU FEEL OK WITH NEGATIVITY... THEREBY CAUSING DISCOURAGEMENT OR LACK OF MOTIVATION IN YOU TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. USING YOUR INNER PRISON AS MECHANISM TO ESCAPE FROM YOUR PROBLEMS... CAN ALSO GIVE RISE TO EMOTIONAL FRAGILITY, VICTIMHOOD ETC... ABSENCE OF GUARDS, CONSIDERING IT TO BE RESTING PLACE DEPICTS TOO MUCH PASSIVITY, LACK OF PROTECTION AND ALERTNESS IN YOUR EMOTIONAL WORLD DEAR NHU... LACK OF A JOY OR SPARK IN WAY YOU FEEL WHICH CAN LEAD TO MORE PESSIMISM AND CAN DILUTE THE JOY OF LIVING... IT SEEMS THAT THESE PARTS OF YOU ARE ENJOYING THE STAY IN PRISON - BEING TOO SELF ABSORBED IN YOUR OWN EMOTIONS WHICH CAN MAKE YOU SELFISH AND THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN SELF... ALSO NOTIONS OF SOCIALIZING MEAINS THAT YOU HAVE UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES WHERE YOU SEEM TO LIKE THIS SITUATION... ITS LIKE HOW SOMETIMES PEOPLE UNCONSCIOULY TEND TO REMAIN IN DIFFICULTIES SO THAT THEY CAN COMPLAIN, FEEL VICTIMIZED, SEEK ATTENTION, SYMPATHY AND LOVE FROM OTHERS... THIS CAN STOP YOU FROM BEING DETACHED AND CAN BLOCK YOUR CAPACITY TO REFLECT BACK ON YOURSELF IN AN UNBIASED WAY SO TO BECOME BETTER... AND IN A WAY IT IS LIKE BEING IN A \"GOLDEN PRISON\" HERE... BECAUSE YOUR INNER EMMA IS HAPPY IN HER RELATIONSHIP, BUT SHE CAN'T GO TO WORK, OR HAVE A STABLE LIFE... SO THIS SHOWS YOU COULD ALSO SOMETIMES PUT YOURSELF IN A LIMITATIVE SITUATION AT THE AFFECTIVE LEVEL, FEELING GOOD ABOUT IT, BUT WITHOUT REALIZING THAT YOU ARE CREATING YOURSELF LIMITATIONS... IT IS LIKE THE FACT OF BEING IN A COUPLE WITH A WOMAN... THEY CAN BE HAPPY TOGETHER AND FEEL GOOD AFFECTIVELY, BUT THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CREATE A FAMILY, TO LIVE THE DEPTH OF THE COMPLEMENTARITY OF THE MASCULINE AND THE FEMININE...

title_pdf: My inner Buddha. last case id: C0212. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 16 September 2022 Angel: 2 Jeliel Dream and Analysis: Angelic Hello Professor ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU This week, I chanted Angel Jeliel with the intention: please help me transform the emotional dependence. OK...THAT'S A WONDERFUL STEPTO WORK ON YOURSELF I was in a research center [- represents creation, proof of ideas, truth. The minus is that people have too many ideas, too theory, lack of reality and ability to realize, self-center YOU CONNECTED VERY WELL WITH THIS SYMBOL... SO IN A WAY IT MEANS DIFFICULTY TO MATERIALIZE AND IMPLEMENT IDEAS/THOUGHTS... ALSO A RESEARCH CENTER IS LIKE A SAFE PLACE TO EXPERIMENT IN A LOW KEY AND LESSER RISK ENVIRONMENT... IN THE SENSE THAT EVEN IF THE EXPERIMENT FAILS IT WILL NOT HAVE MUCH OF AN IMPACT...SO IT IS ALSO A FORM OF PROTECTION, AN OPPORTUNITY TO PREPARE YOURSELF WELL BEFORE YOU ENTER THE CONCRETE WORLD... AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT DREAM ARE... THE MOST ADVANCED RESEARCH CENTER THAT WE CAN IMAGINE... 😇 ] . I was not locked up but I'd been in here for a long time and I really want to get out of here THIS DEPICTS ASPECTS RELATED TO IMPATIENCE WHICH CAN BLOCK YOUR PREPARATION LEVELS AND HENCE LIMIT YOUR CAPACITY... ALSO NOTIONS OF LACK OF RECEPTIVITY AND ACCEPTANCE TOWARDS YOUR PLAN, TENDENCY TO GET BORED OR HURRY UP THINGS WHILE IN PREPARATION STAGE...ITS LIKE HOW SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE TOO EAGER TO ACTIVATE A PROJECT WITHOUT PREPARING FOR IT WELL ENOUGH. I could only go out when I dream that Buddha [- represents pure spirituality. The minus point is tending to hide, run away ] and Buddha allow me to go out. YES...WONDERFUL SO ITS A WAY OF SAYING THAT WHEN YOUR INNER BUDDHA I.E. PURE SPIRITUAL ESSENCE FEELS IT RIGHT THEN ONLY YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO GO... BUT THERE IS A RESISTANCE IN YOU TO ACCEPT THAT DEAR NHU BECAUSE IT IS LIKE YOUR SPIRITUALITY WAS TOO FORCING SOMETIMES, AND COULD "LOCK" YOU IN THIS "RESEARCH CENTER" ENERGY TOO MUCH... AS IF BEING SPIRITUAL BECAME SOMETIMES TOO INTELLECTUAL, CEREBRAL FOR YOU... AND COULD PREVENT YOU TO MANIFEST WELL IN THE CONCRETE (NOT BEING ABLE TO GO OUT AND DEPEND ON A DREAM TO GO OUT)... I'm going into the mass of memories associated with being too theoretical, too many ideas, too thinking, lacking in realization, lacking in action. And I realized that I needed to be freed from my own thoughts. I want to be liberated by running away (Buddha). ALSO THIS STARTING THEME DEPICTS ABOUT YOUR WONDERFUL SPIRITUAL POTENTIAL BUT MEMORIES OF IMPATIENCE, LACK OF RECEPTIVITY CAN BLOCK YOU FROM PREPARING WELL, TAKING YOUR TIME, RESPECTING SYNCHRONICITY FOR THINGS TO UNFOLD IN THE NATURAL FLOW... VERSUS WAITING TOO MUCH FOR THE "DREAM FROM BUDDHA" TO GO OUT... THIS CAN SOMETIMES CREATE RIPPLES AND CAN LIMIT YOUR CAPACITY TO MATERIALIZE... SO THE DREAM WANTS YOU TO LISTEN MORE TO YOUR INNER BUDDHA, WHILE BEING ABLE TO TAKE ACTION BY YOURSELF ALSO WHEN NECESSARY... I also dreamed of Buddha in dreams nearby, but Buddha flew past me and never spoke to me. HERE YOU ARE STARTING TO OBSERVE THAT SOMETIMES YOU DO NOT FEEL CONNECTED WITH YOUR INNER BUDDHA... FLYING PAST REPRESENTS AND ESSENCE OF BEING TOO MUCH IN THOUGHTS THAT CAN MAKE YOU A BIT UNSTABLE AND LESS RECEPTIVE...ITS LIKE THERE IS NO ANCHOR OR STABILITY TO ENABLE THE CONNECT WITH YOUR INNER BUDDHA...IT IS ONLY A FLEETING THOUGHT HERE AND NEEDS TO BE STABLE/FOCUSSED TO DEVELOP A PROFOUND CONNECT... AND THIS SHOWS MEMORIES OF REJECTION ALSO IN YOUR DEEP SPIRITUALITY... A % OF MEMORY WHERE BEING SPIRITUAL MEANS REJECTING OTHERS, LIKE WE CAN SEE IN MONKS WHO WILL GO ON THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN TO MEDITATE, BUT TO BE AWAY FROM OTHERS AND THEIR RESONANCES ALSO... Then one night YOU ARE GOING DEEPER IN YOU UNCONSCIOUS I dreamed that Buddha was talking to me. Buddha HERE YOU ARE BEING SHOWN WHAT THE % OWING TO WHICH YOU SEE YOUR INNER BUDDHA FLYING AND NOT CONNECTING and I are both very big, sitting suspended in the sky and facing each other [- My thoughts about running away and avoiding (the minuses of Buddha) are getting bigger and I have also decided to face this to solve it WELL SEEN, ALSO BOTH OF YOU ARE APPEARING VERY BIG...THIS MEANS UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES OF SUPERIORITY COMPLEX, GIVING TOO MUCH IMPORTANCE TO SELF IN RELATION (SINCE THEY ARE 2 OF YOU) WITH YOU INNER BUDDHA... NOTION OF BEING SUSPENDED IN AIR ALSO MEANS ILLUSORY ELEVATION WHICH CAN SOMETIME CREATE A DISCONNECTION IN YOU WITH REALITY OR CONCRETE ASPECTS OF LIFE... IF YOU MEDITATE ON THE ENERGY OF BEING SUSPENDED IN AIR/SKY... IT IS LIKE AN ESSENCE OF BEING NO-WHERE, STUCK IN THE MIDDLE, STAGNANT, LACK OF ANY MOVEMENT...SO YOU SEE, BECAUSE OF THE ASPECTS ABOVE YOU CAN SOMETIMES FEEL A BIT STUCK IN YOUR OWN WORLD OF THOUGHTS...HENCE DIFFICULTY TO CONNECT WELL WITH YOUR INNER BUDDHA... BECAUSE YOU COULD FEEL A LITTLE MORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHERS WHEN YOU ARE SPIRITUAL... AND THIS IS WHAT CREATES THE REJECTION OF YOUR INNER BUDDHA JUST BEFORE, WHERE HE DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU... ] , below is a modern city [- difficulties related to hyperactivity, a proliferation of activities, large-scale materialization; a superficial, over-metaphysical place ] . Buddha told me: it's time for you to go out. I am grateful for that. YES...NOW YOU ARE BEING SHOWN THAT ITS TIME TO GET OUT OF THE SUSPENDED STATE... TO WORK ON THE ASPECTS OF SUPERIORITY COMPLEX, BEING TOO FOCUSSED ON YOUR OWN SELF SO THAT YOU BECOME WELL GROUNDED, HUMBLE AND STABLE ENOUGH TO BE IN TOUCH WITH YOUR INNER BUDDHA STATE BY MARRYING SPIRIT AND MATTER... My hiding thoughts are multiplied, along with the materialization (modern city). Inner consent is a release and a wish that I pray for to get rid TRANSFORM... IT IS BETTER... 😇 my own thoughts. YES AND ALSO THE ABOVE...THIS DREAM IS ALSO REFLECTION THAT NOW YOU HAVE STARTED TO BECOME MORE RECEPTIVE AND OBSERVANT TOWARDS YOUR OWN BLOCKS AND PATTERNS...THIS IS A WONDERFUL CHANGE... HOWEVER IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO TAKE RIGHT ACTION TOWARDS THIS. In this center, there are many programs have been set up to build and contribute. People invited me to join but I declined because I felt it was unsuitable. But then after I had this dream, the female director of the center [- a part of my feminine polarity, this person represents the qualities of power, rigidity, justice, enthusiasm, dedication to work, focused ] came to see me and asked me to help everyone before leaving here. And I agreed. SO FIRST YOU SHOWED THE SAME IMPATIENCE AND SELF-CENTEREDNESS BY DECLINING AND FEELING THE INNER PROJECTS TO HELP PARTS OF YOURSELF WERE UNSUITABLE... BUT LATER % OF YOUR UNCONSCIOUS FEMININE POLARITY (THE WAY YOU FEEL WITHIN) GUIDED YOU AND ALSO YOU WERE RECEPTIVE TOWARDS THIS... IT IS LIKE A REMINDER TO REMAIN ALSO WELL ALTRUISTIC EVEN IF YOU BECOME MORE EMISSIVE, ENTER MORE IN ACTION... BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN WE ARE SPIRITUAL, WE WANT TO HELP HUMANITY, DO MANY THINGS, BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT IS TO BE ALTRUISTIC WITH THE PEOPLE AROUND US FIRST, OUR FAMILY, OUR NEIGHBORS, OUR FRIENDS ETC... AND IF WE REJECT EVERYONE INSTEAD AND START MEDITATING TOO MUCH, IT IS NOT IDEAL... BUT ON THE OPPOSITE, IF WE HELP OTHERS TOO MUCH AND FORGET TO TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES, THIS IS NOT RIGHT EITHER... SO IT IS THE BALANCE YOU ARE INVITED TO FIND IN YOU HERE... ☯️ This shows my distortions similar to previous dreams of high ego, desire for attention, desire to be central. IT IS MORE OF BLOCKAGES RELATED TO BE TOO FOCUSSED ON SELF AT TIMES AND ALSO BEING IN A HURRY TO MOVE TOWARDS ACTION WITHOUT STABILIZING OR PREPARING WELL IN YOUR THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS... I met the project manager to hear about the plan and I pointed out 1 thing to change the plan for the better. It should distribute functional foods in the pharmacy channel, it will be very effective and improve its reputation. The project manager appreciated my opinion, and he gathered the other leaders to hear my ideas and discuss them in more depth. GOOD...THIS SHOWS YOUR WONDERFUL 19/08/2025, 21:42 My inner Buddha | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/100879 2/3 POTENTIAL AND CAPACITY TO HEAL PARTS OF YOU...AND ALSO YOUR ABILITY TO LISTEN/RECEPTIVE TO IDEAS AND DEVELOPMENTS AROUND YOU.. The dream shows that I have an inner transformation about the possibility of reality. I was caught up in many of my own thoughts and ideas, which I locked myself in. I was looking for a way to free myself. The dream shows that I am liberated, but negative in the direction of running away, hiding. However, when I was liberated, I gradually recognized my ability to actualize and demonstrate this ability, even though it had not been demonstrated in action (suggestions to the manager and discussed further). The dream encouraged me to need to cleanse this distortion more, so that I could better integrate the ability to actualization. WELL DISCERNED DEAR NHU... ALSO PLEASE REFER TO THE COMMENTS ABOVE... I want to ask about dreams that I see myself dreaming like in this dream, what does it mean? - DREAMING IN A DREAM CAN SOMETIMES MEAN THAT YOU ARE GOING DEEPER AND VISTING UNCONSCIOUS ASPECTS OF YOU WHICH FORM THE CAUSES OF THE PATTERNS THAT WERE BEING SHOWN IN THE FIRST LAYER OF THE DREAM... JUST LIKE A DEEPER FILE INSIDE OF ANOTHER FILE, LIKE IN A COMPUTER... Also, in the past, I used to remember the dream scenes I saw before they happened in real life. When I met this incident in real life, I found it very familiar, as if I had seen it somewhere. When I researched it, I found it to be a "Déjà vu" phenomenon. So what do these dreams mean? SOMETIMES YOU CAN VISIT THOSE INCIDENTS AGAIN AS THEY HAVE HAD A PROFOUND IMPACT IN YOUR LIFE OR IN DREAMS THOSE SCENES ARE RECREATED ... IN BOTH CASES THIS DEJA VU IS TO HELP YOU TO REVISIT THAT INCIDENT AND LEARN FROM IT THROUGH SYMBOLIC ANALYSIS OF THAT SITUATION... This week while working with the angel Jeliel, I also had a surprise trip to another city. The reason I go is that I am currently quite stressed with work and my depression, it makes me unable to work a lot, I have a headache and cause work to be delayed for a long time. So I decided to go to a coastal city to rest a bit. The city I go to is also the city that Thuong is in, I know part of the reason I go is also that I want to meet Thuong and to clarify my feelings. OK... IT IS GOOD THAT YOU CLARIFY THIS WITH HER HERE... AND YOU NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS EPSECIALLY IF YOU GO TO ANOTHER CITY TO MEET HER... SO THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE EXPECTATIONS ABOUT YOUR PRESENCE... I have met Thuong and we still talk like 2 normal friends, and I have clearly determined that we are normal friends. Because Thuong has inner wounds, she has unknowingly excessive concern for those around her without her knowledge. She and I have talked about this issue, and she has gradually realized and is also gradually paying attention to the change. IT IS A GOOD STEP TO AFFIRM YOURSELF BUT ALSO WATCH YOUR OWN ENERGY AND % THAT CAN GET TRIGGERED SO THAT YOU ARE IN AWARENESS... YOU CAN KEEP CHANTING TO CLEANSE THESE PERCENTAGES After I returned, I was infected with Covid and needed to take a few days off work to rest. The day before I found out I got Covid, I told a friend: I wish I had been sick for 2 weeks so I could rest. BUT THAT IS NOT A GOOD WAY TO FIND REST DEAR NHU ... MEMORIES OF OVERWORK, INFERIORITY, LACK OF AFFIRMATION CAN SOMETIMES MAKE YOU FEEL THAT TAKING AN INTERMISSION IS WRONG... THIS CREATES REPRESSION... IT IS PERFECTLY NORMAL TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR BOSS ABOUT YOUR INTENTION TO TAKE A FEW DAYS OFF TO REPLENISH AND BALANCE YOUR ENERGIES... ASKING FOR SICKNESS IS ALSO A FORM OF ESCAPISM AND AN UNCONSCIOUS NEED TO SEEK ATTENTION AND SYMPATHY FROM OTHERS... A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO INTROSPECT ON THIS Lately, I really want to rest comfortably, and be able to last a few weeks without affecting anyone. But with the stagnant work situation caused by me, I was hesitant to ask my boss to take a break. But thinking back, maybe I was wrong, I would rather say the problem so that my boss knows and find a way to handle it than to be silent and embrace the problem, so that nothing is done, but I myself am more tired. YES WELL UNDERSTOOD IT WAS THE INNER TRICKY BUDDHA THAT WANTED TO FLY A LITTLE TOO MUCH IN THE AIR... 😉 WE WISH YOU WONDERFUL ANGELIC TRANSFORMATIONS AND REVELALTIONS WITH ANGELS REIYEL AND VEHUEL ANGELIC REGARDS ALEXIS

However, when I was liberated, I gradually recognized my ability to actualize and demonstrate this ability, even though it had not been demonstrated in action (suggestions to the manager and discussed further).

    "dream_text": "This week while working with the angel Jeliel, I also had a surprise trip to another city. The reason I go is that I am currently quite stressed with work and my depression, it makes me unable to work a lot, I have a headache and cause work to be delayed for a long time. So I decided to go to a coastal city to rest a bit. The city I go to is also the city that Thuong is in, I know part of the reason I go is also that I want to meet Thuong and to<h4>clarify my feelings.</h4> I have met Thuong and we still talk like 2 normal friends, and I have clearly determined that we are normal friends. Because Thuong has inner wounds, she has unknowingly excessive concern for those around her without her knowledge. She and I have talked about this issue, and she has gradually realized and is also gradually paying attention to the change. After I returned, I was infected with Covid and needed to take a few days off work to rest. The day before I found out I got Covid, I told a friend: I wish I had been sick for 2 weeks so I could rest. Lately, I really want to rest comfortably, and be able to last a few weeks without affecting anyone. But with the stagnant work situation caused by me, I was hesitant to ask my boss to take a break. But thinking back, maybe I was wrong, I would rather say the problem so that my boss knows and find a way to handle it than to be silent and embrace the problem, so that nothing is done, but I myself am more tired.",

title_pdf: The military class. last case id: C0213. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 23 September 2022 Angel: 36 Menadel Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello Professor ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU This week I chanted Angel Menadel with the question: what do I need to learn from the current job? OK... THAT IS A WONDERFUL INTENTION... I was about to have a military class [- Military represents inner and outer protection. Military class means learning to defend yourself, especially on a physical level because the military carries the energy of emissivity (masculine polarity) ASPECTS RELATED TO DISCIPLINE, STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATION AS WELL. The minus is lack of the ability to protect me on many levels (physical, emotional and intellectual), excessive self-protection without understanding the problems I face; lack of understanding of the law of cause and effect, the law of resonance to refer back to myself to cleanse distortions AND ALSO ON THE MINUS IT DEPICTS NOTIONS OF ABUSE OF POWER, AUTHORITY... IT BRINGS IN AN ESSENCE OF CONFLICT, WAR AS WELL...THE DREAM STARTS WITH YOU BEING IN A MILITARY CLASS I.E. MEMORIES RELATED TO LEARNING, IMPLEMENTATION OF KNOWLEDGE, RECEPTIVITY ETC.... HERE YOU ARE ENTERING IN MEMORIES WHEREIN YOU HAVE NOT YET COMPLETELY INTEGRATED LEARNINGS EMANATING FROM WAR, AGGRESSION, CONFLICT, DIFFICULTIES, ABUSE , LACK OF PROTECTION & ORGANIZATION, DISCIPLINE AND STRUCTURE. ] at the house where I live [- house represents the intimate place, also the inner structure. At the same time, it is also the place where the classroom takes place, representing knowledge and learning at the social level. When my home is also a classroom, that is I am allowing social-level academic activities and energies to invade my intimate space too much, it shows a lack of ability to protect the intimate place, lack of learning and building intimacy inside, so I took the knowledge and learning from outside to compensate the inner lack, causing confusion when I am being too open YES YOU HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE ESSENCE VERY WELL ..ALSO AS YOU HAVE POINTED OUT THAT CLASS IS HAPPENING IN THE HOME WHERE YOU LIVE... THIS DENOTES ASPECTS RELATED TO THE CONFLICT, LACK OF PROTECTION, REPRESSIONS, LACK OF STRUCTURE, DISCIPLINE AND ORGANIZATION (I.E SYMBOLIC ESSENCE OF YOUR INNER MILITARY) CURRENTLY ACTIVE WITHIN YOU IN TERMS OF STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS... ] (not my house in real life). In the class, 10 representatives students [- Angel 10 Aladiah - the Angel of second chances. Distortions are about attitudes and behaviors that generate karmic problems and difficulties; repetition of errors and missed acts. Representative students mean a person who is eager to learn too much AND MORE IMPORTANTLY DIFFICULTY TO LEARN, lacks the practice to apply knowledge to life, and is too mechanical, too theoretical. 10 representatives students mean that I have a tendency to repeat the NEGATIVE PATTERNS OR DISTORTIONS pattern of learning too much when faced with problemsINSTEAD OF LEARNING FROM SUCH DIFFICULTIES, I lack the understanding of the problems encountered to understand and use the knowledge to transform the problem ] are required to practice shooting positions [- Shooting means actions to protect oneself AND ALSO OF ATTACKING/HURTING OTHERS , protect the organization, and destroy dangerous elements. This word carries the emissivity energy of masculine polarity. Shooting position means the preparation for protective actions ATTACKING to finish the target. The minus point is excessive preparation, too thorough, but lack of understanding, improvisation when reality takes place; tend to doubt, think too much negativity about the opponent, thereby easily causing aggressive energy expression, repression, imposition, suppression, lack of understanding of the law of resonance and the law of cause and effect to understand the people or things I meet IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT YOU DID NOT MENTION THE ENERGY OF ATTACKING WHILE PRACTICE SHOOTING POSITIONS...SYMBOLICALLY IT REPRESENTS A % OF YOU WHICH IS PREPARING YOURSELF TO BE IN AN ATTACK MODE...THIS OWING TO DIFFICULTIES TO ACCEPT AND REFER BACK TO SELF...ALSO NOTIONS OF LACK OF DISCERNMENT, BLOCKAGES RELATED TO ACCEPTING YOUR INNER NEGATIVITIES TOWARDS CLEANSING THEM... INSTEAD YOU CAN SOMETIMES APPROACH THESE MEMORIES IN AN ATTACK MODE WHICH LEADS TO REPRESSION, AGGRESSION, ESCAPISM OR CAN MAKE YOU REACT A LOT... ] ALSO YOU WILL SEE THE USAGE OF THE WORD 'PERCIEVED DANGER/THREAT'... THIS MEANS THAT SITUATIONS OR PEOPLE THAT APPEAR AS DANGEROUS MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE SO...SOMETIMES YOU CAN ACT OR PREPARE TO ACT BASED ON YOUR OWN PERCEPTION WHICH CAN BE DIFFERENT FROM REALITY.. When everyone had volunteered to participate but there were still not enough people, I also volunteer to participate. VOLUNTEERING REFLECTS A SENSE OF WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE OR CONTRIBUTE IN A MISSION... IT IS NOT DONE FORCEFULLY... SO YOU SEE YOU HAVE MEMORIES WHERE YOU CAN SOMETIMES BE MORE WILLING AND OK TO EXPERIMENT WITH THE NEGATIVE FORCES (THAT ARE EXPLAINED ABOVE)...INSTEAD OF QUESTIONING YOURSELF IN TERMS OF PLUS AND MINUS... On the night UNCONSCIOUS ASPECTS before the class, I and 2 other friends [- a part of me, representing my construction for intimacy (Angel 3 Sitael). They are classmates and stay at my house to sleep together. The minus point is YOUR AFFINITIES TOWARDS REBELLIOUS TENDENCIES, lack of carefulness, lack of thorough preparation, superficiality, difficulty conceiving a project ] stayed in the house to practice and watch the guns [- Guns represent methods, tools, and abilities to protect yourself and destroy dangerous elements. The minus is brought the energies of INTENSE EMISSIVITY, oppressive, exploitative, imposing, aggressive, grumpy, rigid, and can even carry destructive energy. Watch the guns represent self-observation of the possibilities for self-protection ITS NOT OBSERVATION HERE DEAR NHU...INSTEAD IT REVEALS AN UNCONSCIOUS % WHICH CAN TRIGGER OR PREPARE YOU TO FEEL OK TO USE WEAPONS AND RELATED OVER-EMISSIVE ENERGY WHENEVER YOU PERCIEVE A DIFFICULTY...IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SELF-OBSERVATION IF YOU WERE QUESTIONING THEM AND THEIR USAGE. The minus points are over-protection, lack of action to intervene directly, and lack of understanding of situations, events, and people that create problems ALSO MEMORIES OF ABUSE OF POWER, AGGRESIVITY, VIOLENCE, USING FEAR TO GET THINGS DONE, EGO, WANTING TO FEEL SUPERIOR AND POWERFUL... ] . We also talked a lot. In the room, there were many guns, including real guns and fake guns. I practice the rifles [- represents the conquest of visionary goals with strong reach, slow movement, lack of agility SO IN A WAY TENDENCY TO DISTANCE YOURSELF FROM PERCIEVED THREAT AND ATTACKING IT FROM FAR INSTEAD OF CONFRONTING THEM... ] in class, but there were also many pistols [- represents conquering goals that need a close range with the ability to achieve enough, the ability to move quickly, easy to hide, represents personalities such as lack of transparency, tendency to like to hide EMISSIVITY, WRONG USE OF POWER, IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR, LACK OF EMPATHY AND PATIENCE, TENDENCY TO INDUCE FEAR ] in the room. The guns were stored in transparent glass cases. I hold the remote control to lock and open these boxes. A SUBTLE BUT IMPORTANT REVELATION DEAR NHU...REFLECTS YOUR CAPACITY TO OPEN OR ACTIVATE THE MEMORIES RELATED TO YOUR INNER PISTOLS...DIFFICULTIES TO APPLY DISCERNMENT BECAUSE YOUR FRIENDS COULD MISUSE THE GUNS AND CREATE A PROBLEM HERE, OR KILL SOMEONE... IT IS LIKE YOU GIVE TOO MUCH POWER TO THESE PARTS OF YOURSELF IN THE NAME OF LEARNING, BUT BEYOND THIS COULD VALIDATE TOO MUCH HYPER-EMISSIVITY, ATTACKING FORCES IN YOU... When the other 2 friends used them to practice, I also carefully advised them to check whether the gun was real or fake. I hold the gun to check it carefully before letting them practice. Because real and fake guns are very similar, real guns are only slightly heavier than fake ones. And if the 2 friends were not careful, the guns explode, because there are bullets in them. ENERGY OF BEING CASUAL AND PLAYFUL WHILE EXPERIMENTING WITH NEGATIVE ASPECTS, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE GUNS LOOK ALIKE TOO MUCH... SO THIS SHOWS THAT SOMETIMES YOU COULD NOT BE AWARE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF SOME POTENTIAL ACTIONS CREATED BY YOUR INTENSE EMISSIVITY... The next day, Mr. Tam [- indecisive, too gentle, too receptive ] (my real-life middle school teacher) was the teacher of the class YES .. IT SHOWS THAT SOMETIMES YOUR INNER TEACHER SYMBOL ... A PART OF YOUR MASCULINE POLARITY (CONCRETE WORLD) WHO IS SUPPOSED TO GUIDE YOU TO DISCERN WELL ... INSTEAD THIS PART OF YOU CAN HIMSELF BE INDECISIVE AND CAN LACK AFFIRMATION 19/08/2025, 21:43 The military class | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/101159 2/3 TOWARDS DOING WHAT IS RIGHT. After I practiced, Mr. Tam asked me: Are your name and your mother's name only different from the surname, right? I smiled slightly and answered: yes. SURNAME USUALLY DEPICTS PARENTAL LINEAGE I.E. MEMORIES RELATED TO FAMILY CONSCIOUSNESS AND ALSO REFERENCE TO YOUR MOTHER'S NAME DEPICTS NOTIONS OF MEMORIES RELATED TO YOUR ORIGIN...WHEREIN SOMETIMES OWING TO WRONG CODING TO DEAL WITH NEGATIVITIES AND DIFFICULTIES IT CAN SOMETIMES BECOME DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO DISCERN WELL AFFIRM YOURSELF TOWARDS RIGHT ACTION SO YOU SEE THE BOTH EXTREMES : TOO MUCH EMISSIVITY FROM THE GUNS, AND TOO MUCH RECEPTIVITY FROM YOUR INNER MR.TAM... Then I go back to my seat. After that, the class went by quite comfortably. The dream showed that I was over-prepared for inner protection, too theoretical, lacking in practice and realism, I was resonating with negative energies related to annihilation, because of lack of knowledge about the law of resonance and the law of cause and effect. A GOOD GLOBAL UNDERSTANDING DEAR INITIATE... YOU ARE DOING BEAUTIFUL EFFORTS IN YOUR ANALYSIS, CONGRATULATIONS FOR YOUR CONSISTENCY AND WISH TO UNDERSTAND YOURSELF 😇👏 YOU HAD A VERY INTERESTING ANSWER REGARDING YOUR QUESTION ALSO... BECAUSE IN YOUR ACTUAL JOB YOU COULD BE FACING THIS KIND OF MEMORIES, AND WISH TO LEARN TO MANAGE YOUR OWN EMISSIVITY TO AFFIRM WELL TO YOUR COLLEAGUES... AND THIS DREAM REFLECTS A STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT CAN BE BREWING WITHIN YOU OWING TO YOUR LIFE SITUATIONS ON THE OUTSIDE... IT IS LIKE IN A % YOU ARE UNCONSCIOUSLY PREPARING YOURSELF TO SHOOT OR EXPERIMENT WITH NEGATIVE EMISSIVITY ASPECTS WHENEVER YOU PERCIEVE A DIFFICULTY... WE ADVISE YOU TO BE WATCHFUL OF YOUR ENERGY IN THE COMING FUTURE DEAR NHU, WHEN YOU TALK TO YOUR COLLEAGUES, WHEN YOU TRY TO AFFIRM SOMETHING DURING A MEETING FOR EXAMPLE... ALWAYS REMEMBER TO BE MORE IN QUALITIES AND TO ACCEPT THE NEGATIVES WITH COMPASSION WITHOUT TRYING TO FIGHT WHAT YOU DON'T AGREE WITH... ACCEPTANCE WILL NOT ACTIVATE ANY CONFLICT WITHIN YOU AND HENCE WILL PREPARE YOU BETTER TO DEAL WITH IT IN AN ANGELIC WAY... ALSO PLEASE REFER TO THE COMMENTS ABOVE BECAUSE WE CAN HAVE THE BEAUTIFUL QUALITIES OF THE MILITARY AND BE AFFIRMED, DISCIPLINED, RIGORED, BUT WITHOUT HAVING TO BE TOO EMISSIVE OR ATTACKING OTHERS... IT IS THE NUANCE YOU CAN CONTINUE TO MEDITATE ON, SO THAT YOU CAN AFFIRM YOURSELF WITH THE RIGHT BALANCE... NOT TOO EMISSIVE, AND NOT TOO RECEPTIVE EITHER, AT WORK OR IN ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHERS... ☯️ WE WISH FOR YOU TO DEVELOP AND CONSTRUCT A STRONG INNER HOME BASED ON RIGHT VALUES AND DIVINE QUALITIES WITH ANGELS SITAEL AND ELEMIAH ANGELIC REGARDS ALEXIS

PDF text: Dream date: Thursday, 10 March 2022 Angel: 51 Hahasiah Dream mood: Surprise Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello teachers, ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU This week, I chanted Angel Hahasiah with the intention: please help me integrate Qualities of Angel Hahasiah to healmy elder sister and me. I had this intention because my elder sister was being Covid-19 virus and I was taking care of her. IT IS A WONDERFUL GESTURE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR SISTER... THIS ALSO MEANS YOU ARE TAKING CARE AND HEALING YOUR INNER SISTER TOO Dream: My family [- my origin, both polarities, my ability to receptivity and emissivity. Minus points of my family are lack of communication between each member, lack of sympathy, understanding and tolerance, lack of listening ONE'S FAMILY IS HIS OR HER FIRST CIRCLE OF SOCIETY THROUGH WHICH ONE LEARNS INTERACTIONS, EXCHANGES, VALUE SYSTEM, COOPERATION, CONFLICT MANAGEMENT, HELPING/SUPPORT ETC. AS A CHILD THESE SEEDS GET SOWN UNCONSCIOUSLY OR SUB-CONSCIOUSLY THROUGH ONE'S EXPERIENCES AND OBSERVATIONS AND THIS SHAPES HIS/HER PERSONALITY AS HE/SHE GROWS UP... SO SYMBOLICALLY SPEAKING FAMILY IS THE FIRST LEARNING SCHOOL FOR EVERY CHILD... IN THIS DREAM YOU ARE CONNECTING WITH MEMORIES OR ASPECTS (AS MENTIONED ABOVE) THAT HAVE SHAPED YOUR PERSONALITY AND WAY OF LIFE ... HOWEVER, ONE CAN ALWAYS CHANGE AND BECOME BETTER THROUGH AWARENESS AND INTEGRATION OF LAW OF RESONANCE DEAR NHU ] organizes a party [- communication at the collective level. Minus points are laziness, flee, lack of inner communication, too materialistic YES, ON THE MINUS IT CAN ALSO MEAN TENDENCY TO BE DRIVEN BY SENSATIONS, NEEDS TO SOCIALIZE TOO MUCH, SHOW-OFF ETC. IT IS SOMETIMES DONE TO SEEK LOVE, CAMRADRIE, ASSOCIATION ETC. IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE FOR THE INNER LACKS ] at my house [- my intimacy, my inner place where I can renew, replenish myself. Minus points are difficulty renewing myself, untidy, abandoned YES WELL CONNECTED DEAR NHU ] . My house now resembles the old Chinese style [- abusive use of the power of materialization, ancestral memory marked by deep insecurity and lack of resources, emotional coldness, feeling of inferiority and superiority ASPECTS OF REPRESSION, RIGIDITY ETC. ALSO SINCE IT IS OLD IT MEANS ANCIENT MEMORIES AND OLD MATERIALISTIC PATTERNS WHICH NOW NEED TO CHANGE ] , relatively large [- lack of inner structure, emptiness, astray NOTIONS OF SUPERIORITY COMPLEX ] . YOU HAVE CONNECTED WELL WITH THE SYMBOLS HERE... SO YOU SEE THE OLD CHINESE ASPECT IN YOUR LARGE INNER HOUSE CAN SOMETIMES CREATE THAT NEED IN YOUR INNER FAMILY TO HOST A PARTY = HAVE A MORE MATERIALISTIC WAY TO ENJOY THINGS, SPEND A GOOD TIME WITH THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE... AND THE FOLLOWING EXPLAINS WELL HOW THIS MECHANISM IS SHOWING => This scene shows that my inner house lacks of structure, lacks of understanding, communication, is too materialistic, insecurity, feeling of inferiority and superiority. And these distortions come from my origins, my 2 polarities (family). VERY GOOD SUMMARY... The party was quite crowded I.E. TO MANY NEEDS, DIFFICULTY TO CONNECT DEEPER, ASPECTS OF SUPERFICIALITY. In the middle of the party, my mother [- A PART OF My feminine polarity, YOUR EMOTIONAL ASPECT WHICH IN A % HAS tendency to sacrifice for the family, lack of listening, understanding and communication ] brought up a few trays of food [- too materialistic, difficulty in stabilizing energy and keeping energy, difficulty in transforming energy USUALLY TRAY IS USED FOR SERVING FOOD AND ALSO SYMBOLIZES RECEPTIVITY AS ONE KEEPS THINGS ON A TRAY... ON THE MINUS IT DEPICTS A TENDENCY TO SERVE DRIVEN BY NEEDS (AND NOT UNCONDITIONALITY OR ALTRUISM), WRONG WAY OF NOURSIHING MULTIPLE PARTS OF YOU WHICH CAN SOMETIMES BE TOO MATERIALISTIC AND AND CAN LACK BALANCE. ] . Those are pig parts [- laziness, accumulate negative energy, too gentle, too much needs REFLECTS YOUR INSTINCTUAL NEEDS WHICH CAN MAKE YOU TOO MUCH ATTACHED TO MATTER... PIG IS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR FOOD AND IS CONNECTED WITH OVEREATING I.E. NOTIONS OF EXCESSIVITY DUE TO INNER LACKS, INSECURITIES, GREED, LACK OF DISCERNMENT WHEN IT COMES TO NOURISHMENT ETC... PIG ALSO LIKE TO STAY IN MUDDY WATERS WHICH DENOTES TOO MUCH ATTACHEMENT TO CONSENSED EMOTIONS RELATED TO MATTER... ] . Mom was happy and said this is a very special gift [- tendency to live in old memories, difficulty with generosity and sharing GIFT ON THE MINUS SUGGESTS PUTTING CONDITIONS AND EXPECTATIONS IN GIVING AND RECEIVING... ITS LIKE HOW SOMETIMES PEOPLE HELP OR DO SOMETHING WITH THE EXPECTATION OF RECEIVING SOMETHING IN RETURN... HERE YOUR INNER MOTHER IS GIFTING PIG PARTS... SO YOU SEE, ITS A PART OF YOU (AND ALSO YOUR ORIGIN) WHICH HAS A TENDENCY TO BE DRIVEN BY MATERIALISTIC NEEDS IN EXCHANGES OR GIVING/RECIEVING WITH PEOPLE... THESE EXCHANGES CAN CREATE KARMIC ATTACHMENT AND BONDAGE DEAR NHU ] for 4 people who helped my family and we are indebted to them [- number 4 represents inner structure, also related to Angel 4 Elemiah, diabolic power directed toward the satisfaction of personal needs; inertia, destructive tendencies WELL CONNECTED ] . Because of the distortions of my feminine polarity, I have difficulty with transforming energy on the social level (crowded), difficulty with generosity and sharing, tendency to satisfaction of personal needs. YOU HAVE DISCERNED WELL THE OVERALL MESSAGE... WONDERFUL STEP DEAR INITIATE! I was surprised that my mother gave them this strange gift YES, NOW YOU HAVE STARTED TO OBSERVE THIS PART OF YOU WITH MORE CLARITY, DISCERNMENT , and I don't like eating meat, so I decided to leave THIS REFLECTS THAT SOMETIMES YOU CAN GET A BIT EXTREME IN YOUR ENERGY... THIS COULD ALSO HAVE BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP AND MAKE YOUR INNER MOTHER UNDERSTAND WITH LOVE AND COMPASSION... INSTEAD YOU CHOSE TO LEAVE YOU COULD HAVE SIMPLY REFUSED TO HAVE THE FOOD, BUT STAY THERE AND ENJOY THE MOMENT... SO YOU SEE, THOUGH YOU ARE OBSERVING THE MINUS IN YOU BUT INSTEAD OF WORKING TOWARDS RECTIFYING IT, YOU CAN SOMETIMES BE IN RESISTANCE OR EGO. THIS CAN MAKE YOU ESCAPE FROM THAT NEGATIVE ASPECT... A WONDERFUL MOMENT TO INTROSPECT ON THIS DEAR NHU... DREAMS LIKE THIS ARE A REAL GIFT FROM UP-ABOVE . When I approached the door [- represents openness, protection, ability to access between spaces ALSO ON THE MINUS DIFFICULTY TO ENTER A NEW/DIFFERENT STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS BECAUSE OF THE ASPECTS MENTIONED ABOVE ] , I saw that the plate of food was a pig's head [- head is about thought level. Pig's head represents negative thoughts accumulated, laziness thoughts YES THOUGHTS WHICH CAN BE TOO DRIVEN BY MATERIALISTIC NEEDS.. THIS CAN ALSO LIMIT YOUR CAPACITY TO THINK AND DISCERN IN A % ] . I was surprised to see that the pig's head could talk and was alive [- talk is an act of communication. This symbol shows me sometimes I'm lazy to communicate with others and inner parts also, sometimes too gentle IT IS NOT NORMAL FOR DEAD BODY TO SPEAK OR ACT...MATTER (I.E. BODY OR BODY PARTS IN THIS CASE) IS TEMPORAL BUT MEMORIES, PATTERNS, TENDENCIES REMAIN... IF THEY ARE NOT CLEANSED THEY KEEP ACCOMPANYING YOU FROM ONE LIFE TO ANOTHER IN FORM OF MEMORIES, LIFE SITUATIONS ETC... SO YOU SEE THIS PART OF THE DREAM IS REVEALING SYMBOLICALLY THIS % IS IN YOU THAT IT IS ACTIVE EVEN WHEN IT IS PHYSICALLY DEAD (MEMORIES RELATED TO THE SYMBOL OF PIG)... ANOTHER ANGLE OF LOOKING AT IT IS THAT THE PIG HEAD HAS BEEN SERVED AS FOOD EVEN WHEN IT IS STILL ALIVE - I.E. NOTIONS OF TOO MUCH ATTACHMENT & DEPENDENCY INFLUENCING YOU TO NOURISH YOUSELF DRIVEN TOO MUCH BY NEEDS (AS SYMBOLIZED BY PIG) .. WE INVITE YOU TO REFLECT ON THIS SYMBOL DEAR NHU.. ] , it was raw meat YOU CAN OBSERVE THIS AS WELL AS AN EXTENSION TO WHAT IS EXPLANED ABOVE.. SERVING RAW MEAT AS FOOD DENOTES IN A PERCENTAGE ANIMALISITIC TENDENCIES, LACK OF REFINEMENT, TOO MUCH FOCUS ON ONE'S OWN NEEDS ONLY. And I wonder: oh, after cutting off the head, it can still talk. The pig's head doesn't talk much, but I'm still aware of it talking. I am aware of the distortions associated with my feminine polarity, and I am gradually transforming it. However, I still had blockages in my transformation, so I stopped, without continuing to walk through the door to connect to a new space. I am intrigued by the talking pig's head, which shows that I still have many negative thoughts that need to be transformed, distortions about laziness, too gentle in communication. With my intention to heal my elder sister and me, so this dream give me an invitation from the Up Above to continue to cleanse distortions related to my feminine polarity. YES REVEALING PARTS OF YOUR EMOTIONAL SELF WHICH YOU ARE ABLE WORK ON BEAUTIFULLY Currently, my elder sister has recovered from her illness and I am fine. During the time we were being with, we often ate meat. According to my elder sister, this is a way to nourish and enhance health. I don't like to eat meat but I still agree to eat with her so that we can have fun together and not create more problems for my sister when she was being sick. I realized that I have a tendency to please others, especially my family members, my inferiority complex makes me rarely speak my thoughts and feelings. Therefore, I easily get pent up and accumulate a lot of thoughts. WONDERFUL INTROSPECTION DEAR NHU...WHAT WE EAT REFLECTS WHO WE ARE IN ENERGY... AND NOW AS A DSSI STUDENT YOU 19/08/2025, 15:43 Special gift | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/92154 2/3 ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF RIGHT NOURISHMENT... HAVING SAID THAT ONE SHOULD NOT FORCE HIMSELF/HERSELF TOWARDS CHANGING A HABIT... IT IS A TRANSITIONARY PROCESS WHICH HAPPENS ON ITS OWN WHEN YOU KEEP WORKING ON YOUR MEMORIES... THIS MECHANISM OF EATING MEAT WILL LEAVE YOU ONCE YOU HAVE CLEANSED NEGATIVE MEMORIES RELATED TO NOURISHMENT AND THIS EXCESSIVE NEED TO PLEASE OTHERS... BECAUSE YOU CAN SIMPLY REFUSE TO HAVE MEAT BUT STILL SPENDING A GOOD TIME WITH HER... IT IS NOT BECAUSE YOU DON'T EAT THE SAME THING THAT YOU REJECT HER... :) IT IS LIKE IN YOUR DREAM HERE, YOU SOMETIMES NOURISH FROM ORDINARY FOOD WHEN YOU ARE WITH OTHERS, TO PLEASE THEM... THIS IS WHY YOUR MOTHER WAS SERVING PIG TO GUESTS... IT IS A % OF YOU THAT IS READY TO "EAT" ANYTHING IN TERMS OF ENERGY TO PLEASE OTHERS SOMETIMES... NOT NECESSARILY CONCRETE MEAT, BUT ALSO ORDINARY CONVERSATIONS, SUPERFICIAL TALKS ETC... ALSO, EVEN WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT IT RIGHT, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW IT BECAUSE OF POWERFUL FORCE OF MEMORIES... LIKE IN THIS CASE YOUR MEMORIES OF WANTING TO PLEASE OTHERS WAS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO BLOCK YOUR DECISION MAKING... YOU CAN RESPECT BELIEFS OF YOUR SISTER BUT CAN STILL DECIDE IN THE LIGHT OF PLUS AND MINUS FOR E.G. IF YOU WISH... EVEN WHILE SHE WAS HAVING MEAT, YOU COULD HAVE MADE OR ORDERED A VEGETARIAN MEAL FOR YOURSELF AND STILL YOU COULD HAVE SPENT GOOD TIME TOGETHER... I have a question when I decode the number symbols. How can I research and understand more meaning of the number symbols besides based on number of Angels? FOR NUMBER SYMBOLS, IT IS THE RIGHT APPROACH TO CONNECT WITH THE QUALITIES AND HUMAN DISTORTIONS RELATED WITH THE ANGEL NUMBER SHOWN IN THE DREAM...THIS CAN BE SEEN KEEPING IN MIND THE CONTEXT OF THE DREAM... And how can I connect the symbols in the same paragraph to decode them in the right way? YOU CAN SEE IT LIKE THE SCENARIO OF A MOVIE... THE SYMBOL 1 IS THE MAIN TOPIC... AND THEN THE SYMBOL 2 ADDS A LAYER TO THE PREVIOUS SYMBOL... AND SO ON... YOU CAN ALSO FOLLOW YOUR INTUITION AND RESONANCE TO EXTRACT THE LEARNINGS FOR YOU... WE CAN SEE YOU ARE ALREADY DOING IT WELL... THIS WILL KEEP GETTING PRECISE WITH MORE INNER WORK AND PRACTICE... IT IS A GOOD PRACTICE TO MENTION THE GLOBAL SUMMARY OF THE DREAM. THIS WILL HELP YOU TO CONNECT MULTIPLE SYMBOLS TOGETHER. REMEMBER TO RESPECT YOUR OWN PACE OF EVOLUTION... Thank you A WONDERFUL DREAM DEAR NHU AND AN AMAZING ATTEMPT IN DECODING PARTS OF YOU TO UNCOVER ASPECTS AND PATTERNS THAT HAVE LED TO BLOCKAGES AND DIFFICULTIES IN YOUR LIFE... WE WISH AN ANGELIC TRANSFORMATION AND TRANSCENDENCE OF THESE MEMORIES WITH ANGELS PAHALIAH AND MELAHEL ALEXIS

title_pdf: Life Take a bath. last case id: C0215. PDF text: Dream date: Thursday, 29 September 2022 Angel: 37 Aniel Dream and Analysis: Angelic Hello Professor ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU, This week I chanted Angel Aniel with the intention: please help me change the old pattern of hiding. OK...A WONDERFUL WAY TO KNOW ABOUT MULTIPLE ASPECTS OF YOU :-) I went to Jolie's house [- She A PART OF YOUR FEMININE POLARITY THAT (ON THE MINUS) NEEDS TO DEVELOP QUALITIES OF is a very kind person, spiritual, meticulous, empathetic, thorough, enthusiastic, gentle, delicate, ethereal, has certain standards, well organized. She A PART OF YOU EMOTIONAL WORLD THAT is also a perfectionist, a bit rigid at times. I'm visiting her inner structure and intimacy. ] - an older sister who is also a DSSI student (I don't know this person, in fact, I temporarily named her)AN UNCONSCIOUS PART YOUR FEMININE ASPECT WHICH ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH KNOWLEDGE. I went to Jolie's bathroom [- represents purification. The minus points are difficulty in purification, accepting distortions, difficulty in understanding and applying knowledge WELL DECODED ] to take a shower. SO THE THEME OF THE DREAM SUGGESTS THAT YOU ARE CONNECTING WITH UNCONSCIOUS AFFINITIES IN YOUR WORLD OF EMOTIONS, THE WAY YOU FEEL (FEMININE ASPECT) WHILE WORKING ON YOURSELF SPIRITUALLY (BEING IN DSSI KNOWLEDGE) BEING IN THE ENERGY OF YOUR INNER JOLIE (DECODED ABOVE)... AND AT THE SAME TIME HERE IT IS NOT LOGICAL THAT YOU GO TO SOMEONE'S HOUSE TO TAKE A SHOWER HERE... OF COURSE WE CAN IMAGINE THAT THE PERSON HOSTS YOU AND YOU TAKE A SHOWER AT NIGHT IF YOU STAY AT THEIR PLACE, BUT HERE IN THE CONTEXT IT SHOWS MEMORIES THAT COULD DEPEND ON OTHERS TOO MUCH TO FEEL PURIFIED... AS IF YOU COULD USE THE RELATIONAL LEVEL TO FEEL REPLENISHED, RELAXED AND CLEANSED AT TIMES... BUT MIXING WITH NEEDS FOR EMOTIONAL WARMTH THAT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO CONNECT FROM WITHIN... WANTING TO CONNECT WITH THE INTIMACY OF THE OTHER PERSON TO FEEL NOURISHED EMOTIONALLY, BUT DEVELOPING AN INVASIVE % AT THE SAME TIME... Jolie stood at the door REPRESENTS A PATH WAY, ENTRANCE INTO A STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS...IN THIS DREAM YOU ARE ENTERING IN A STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS RELATED TO YOUR INNER JOLIE talking about her previous meeting with me at the airport [- represents preparation at the thought level in advancing on the social level. Minus points are difficulty in preparation, too much thinking, difficulty in actualizing, too theoretical ALSO DIFFICULTY IN MOVING FROM ONE STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS TO ANOTHER, LACK OF DISCERNMENT, TRIGGER OF NEEDS WHILE BEING IN ENERGY OF INNER JOLIE ] . Jolie described what she was wearing, but I still can't remember for sure, I remember vaguely THIS MEMORY OR PATTERN OF INNER JOLIE IS TRYING TO REMIND ITSELF OR GET ACTIVATED IN YOU...REMINDING YOU ABOUT THE JOLIE SYMBOL INSIDE OF YOU...NOT BEING ABLE TO REMEMBER MEANS IT IS UNCONSCIOUSLY HIDDEN AND NOT YET CLEANSED OR TRANSFORMED. Then Jolie instructed me to use the bathroom, ALSO SOMETIMES YOUR INNER JOLIE CAN INVADE OR LET OTHERS INVADE HER INTIMACY, BECAUSE IT IS NOT LOGICAL TO WELCOME SOMEONE IN YOUR HOUSE TO MAKE THEM TAKE A SHOWER... SO THIS SHOWS TOO MUCH KINDNESS, OPENING TO OTHERS AT TIMES, BECAUSE OF NEEDS FOR EMOTIONAL CLOSENESS WITH THE PERSON... she guided me very carefully about how to use it, and where to put the necessary items. I find Jolie's bathroom convenient and sufficient. Jolie's house YOUR INNER STRUCTURE looks very airy, with lots of glass, surrounded by trees and flowers [- Glass represents protection, shielding with proper acceptance (transparent) ON THE MINUS IT CAN MEAN FRAGILITY, FOCUS ON APPEARANCE WHICH SOMETIMES MIGHT NOT BE SO USEFUL OR NEEDED, LACK OF TRANSPERANCY, ILLUSORY ASPECTS. Trees and flowers belong to the emotional world. The minus point of Jolie's house is that she is too open-minded, too emotional, lack inner protection, proper secrecy, and sometimes she may have too much sympathy for unlucky people, emotional dependence AND THIS IS WHAT SHE DID WITH YOU HERE IN THE DREAM... IT IS NOT LOGICAL TO WELCOME SOMEONE TO MAKE HIM TAKE A SHOWER... THIS SHOWS THE ASPECT OF HAVING TOO MUCH SYMPATHY FOR OTHERS, CREATING AN EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCY IN THEM (MAKE THEM FEEL PURIFIED BUT IN A WAY THAT IS NOT RIGHT, BECAUSE THEY INVADE HER PERSONAL SPACE)...

EXCHANGES DRIVEN BY MATERIALITY, LACK OF UNCONDITIONALITY...

TENDENCY TO UNCONSCIOUSLY PROJECT YOUR OWN NEEDS, LACKS ON OTHERS (ESPECIALLY WHILE IN THE SOCIAL DIMENSION)... AND YOU SEE HERE THAT YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE COMING TO JOLIE'S PLACE TO TAKE A BATH... SO YOU SEE A MECHANISM IN YOUR INNER WORLD WHERE YOU COULD HAVE NOURISHED THIS TENDENCY TO NOURISH FROM OTHER'S INTIMACY SINCE A LONG TIME (ELDERLY WOMAN)... Jolie followed her down, then she saw me and asked if I hadn't showered. I said: yes, I looked at the flower pots for a bit, now I'm going to take a bath. I took a glass of guava juice and went to the bathroom. Jolie goes with me to look around to see if there is any problem. MEMORIES OF PERFECTIONISM, NOT RESPECTING OTHER PEOPLE'S INTIMACY, TENDENCY TO SOMETIMES IMPOSE YOURSELF ON OTHERS IN A %.... THESE ASPECTS CAN BLOCK YOUR CAPACITY TO PURIFY... AND COMING IN THE SHOWER WITH YOU SHOWS A NEED FOR RAPPROCHEMENT ALSO, BEHIND THE NOTION OF WANTING TO ENSURE EVERYTHING IS GOING WELL... The dream showed me my difficulties in purifying my distortions. This shows that I have a lot of emotional dependence, easily distracted by the emotions of others outside and I allow it to affect myself, which sometimes makes me overwhelmed by their emotions and stories, but I forget to listen and recreate my own feelings. I also have a % of people who care about what other people say about me, but I don't show it. But in me, there is also a % of spiritual abilities to purify these memories (Jolie). WELL SUMMARIZED DEAR NHU...YOU HAVE NICELY CONNECTED WITH THE MEESAGE OF THE DREAM... ALSO PLEASE REFER TO THE COMMENTS ABOVE TO DEEPER UNDERSTAND MULTIPLE ASPECTS THAT CAN SOMETIMES BLOCK YOUR CAPACITY TO PURIFY AND CLEANSE INNER NEGATIVITIES... In fact, a few weeks ago I emailed my boss about my self-assessment and suggested I quit. I realized that when I was having problems because my depression came back, preventing me from working much, I quit because I realized I was not being responsible for the job I received. So, I took the initiative to propose first. Up to now, my boss has not approved my proposal, but physically, I really don't know how I should do it to be able to continue working (maybe a little slower) and gradually made my brain less painful from too much stress and negative thinking (my expression of depression). JUST LIKE THE PURPLE FLOWERS YOU WERE CUTTING IN THE DREAM...SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE TOO HARSH ON YOURSELF DEAR NHU... AND THIS IS WHY YOU SEEK FOR EMOTIONAL COMPENSATION HERE IN JOLIE'S HOUSE... IT IS FOR YOUR BOSS TO ASSESS AND MEASURE YOUR EFFECIENCY AND COMPETENCY... YOUR ROLE IS TO DO YOUR WORK WITH RESPONSIBILITY AND DETACHMENT... YES AS YOU SHARED... IT HAPPENS THAT YOU DON'T FEEL CONNECTED WITH WORK ANYMORE...IT IS VERY NORMAL. SO INSTEAD OF TAKING AN EXTREME STEP AND CONCLUDING FAST, IT IS ADVISABLE TO DISCUSS AND TALK ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS, SITUATION WITH YOUR BOSS...SOMETIMES JUST QUITTING CAN ALSO BE ESCAPISM DEAR NHU... YES YOU CAN TAKE IT SLOW, MAYBE FOR A TEMPORARY PERIOD TAKE LITTLE LESSER RESPONSIBILITIES AT YOUR WORK AND FOCUS MORE ON YOUR INNER HEALTH... DISCUSSING OPENLY WITH YOUR BOSS CAN OPEN UP MULTIPLE POSSIBILITIES OF DEALING WITH IT IN A BALANCED WAY... The more I went inside of myself, the more I wanted to focus on understanding the cause of my illness, unaffected by the outside world, and the more I wanted to be alone. Therefore, in the last few days when I am no longer active and happy with everyone in the company, less participating in conversations and parties. I am tired of trying to smile, and they also find it strange. Even this week, my company had a team-building trip, there were many fun activities, but I was not in the spirit of joy at the moment, I participated as a cheerleader. Sometimes I just want to tell everyone that I want to be alone. I found this to be quite negative because I was so influenced by the energy, feelings and thoughts of people around me, that I had no space for thoughts about myself. I struggled a lot inside and it drained me a lot of energy. I don't know how to adjust properly, but even if I'm alone in this situation, I still find myself unable to concentrate. to understand, recognize, and transform physical distortions and difficulties, and in memories. IT IS PERFECTLY FINE TO BE WITH SELF AND HARMONIZE YOUR ENERGY BUT ALSO IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE BALANCED AND INCARNATED IN MATTER SO THAT YOU DO NOT BECOME TOO AIRY. AS YOUR DREAM ALSO SUGGESTS THAT YOU WERE NOT SHOWN TO BE ABLE TO PURIFY BECAUSE YOU GOT DISTRACTED BY APPEARANCES AND SITUATIONS ON THE OUTSIDE, SEEKING EMOTIONAL REPLENISHEMENT AND SUPPORT IN THE PRESENCE OF OTHERS TOO MUCH... HOWEVER, BY CUTTING YOURSELF AWAY FROM THIS IS ALSO ESCAPISM...THOUGH IT IS ABSOLUTELY FINE TO TAKE AN INTERMISSION AND COME BACK WITH RENEWED FOCUS BUT EVENTUALLY YOU NEED TO BE BACK IN MATTER TO EXPERIMENT, LEARN AND EVOLVE THROUGH MULTIPLE EXPERIENCES AND THE MEMORIES THAT THIS WOULD TRIGGER... AND DEVELOP A BEAUTIFUL EMOTIONAL PRESENCE FOR YOURSELF FIRST, WHEN YOU PURIFY YOUR MEMORIES... 🌟 WISHING YOU WONDERFUL TRANSFORMATIONS AND PURIFICATIONS WITH ANGELS HARIEL AND ANIEL ANGELIC REGARDS ALEXIS 19/08/2025, 21:43 Take a bath | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/101588 3/4

title_pdf: Move to part-time position. last case id: C0216. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 14 October 2022 Angel: 35 Chavakhiah Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello Professor ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU I don't remember any dreams this week, so I'll analyze the week's events. OK As I shared with you before, I have resigned from my current company. And last week, my boss [- a part of my masculine polarity, lack of assertiveness, lack of recognition, stubbornness, high self- esteem, too attached to responsibility, lack of inner wealth, there are many karmic consequences related to abundance, want to get rich quick ] made an appointment to talk to me. We talk freely in a cafe [- represents communication at the social level, the minus is difficulty in listening, receptive and communicating at the social level ] . I want to stop, change the way I construct and move forward in society to start a new path. However, I have difficulty receiving the distortions of my inner boss, difficulty communicating with myself to learn and transform. So, my resignation shows the wrong end when the distortions have not been properly understood and transformed. At first, we talked about health [- difficulty in self-observation to recognize physical and mental health problems, difficulty accepting treatments and understanding health problems, lack of understanding of the law of karma ] . My boss advised me to go for a check-up and exercise [- having problems related to masculine energy, difficulties in emissivity, acting, materializing ] . After that, we talked about the economic situation in the country and the world , the inflation situation, and the economic recession that will affect the next 1-2 years. A signal from the universe told me to go back inner to take care of my mental health and improve my materialization. Because in the email I sent to my boss I said that I was stressed and this affected my work efficiency. YES... IT WAS A WAY TO OPEN THE CONVERSATION... AND SYMBOLICALLY HE WAS BEHAVING LIKE A FATHER, WANTING TO TAKE CARE OF YOU BY TALKING ABOUT YOUR HEALTH... AND TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMIC RECESSION WAS ALSO A SIGN FOR YOU, BECAUSE YOU ARE ALSO LIVING A "RECESSION" IN TERMS OF WORK ACTIVITY AFTER QUITTING... AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU REPLACE THIS MOVEMENT IN YOUR LIFE ON THE RIGHT TRACK NOW... Finally, my boss talked to me about work. As in the content of the email, I have given 2 options, either give me a quit or move to a more suitable position. And I suggested quitting. However, my boss told me to move to a part-time job [- difficulty in understanding and learning lessons at work, need to correct my intentions to be right at work, in the way I construct, develop myself and move forward in society ] managing a project. I was a bit surprised because I expected to quit or move to another position but still work full-time. Because if I work part-time, I will definitely have to find another job to cover my monthly living expenses. And I don't want that, I hope to be able to focus entirely on one job. This show a high ego, too much masculine energy, and a lack of receptivity caused me to give 2 options for my boss to choose, from while the boss should have been the one to decide and discuss with me. Changing to a part-time position shows that I need to learn more lessons about receptivity, being too stubborn, having too many ideas, lacking materialization. WHILE IT IS OK TO SOMETIMES TAKE IT EASY OR PLAN YOUR WORK BETTER, BUT IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO BE PRACTICAL AND PRAGMATIC ABOUT IT DEAR NHU... RESIGNING FROM A JOB WITHOUT HAVING ANY OTHER JOB OPPORTUNITY IN YOUR HAND MIGHT NOT BE A GOOD DECISION... AND SHOW THAT YOU COULD HAVE BEEN ALSO TOO MUCH IN A FORM OF EGO, DRASTIC/EXTREME IN THE POSSIBILITIES FOR IMPROVEMENTS... THE SHARING ABOVE SHOWS A BIT OF DUALITY IN YOU... ON ONE HAND YOU INITIATED YOUR RESIGNATION AND ON THE OTHER HAND YOU ARE ALSO WORRIED ABOUT MANAGING EXPENSES... WHICH IS NORMAL TO TAKE CARE OF, OF COURSE... AT LEADERSHIP LEVEL THEY ARE GENERALLY GOOD IN UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE AND EMOTIONS...INSTEAD OF WRITING AN EMAIL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO FIRST HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH YOUR BOSS... YOU COULD HAVE SEEKED GUIDANCE FROM HIM... IT SEEMS THAT OWING TO YOUR INTERNAL CONFUSION AND PRESSURE YOU TOOK A RASH DECISION... EVEN THOUGH, YOU DON'T LIKE THE JOB BUT IT IS STILL IMPORTANT FOR YOU... TO MAINTAIN YOUR LIVING EXPENSES... YOU COULD HAVE TRANSITIONED TO SOME OTHER ROLE OR JOB (WHICH YOU LIKE) GRADUALLY.... BY PATIENTLY SEARCHING FOR IT AND TILL THEN YOU COULD HAVE CONTINUED WITH THE CURRENT JOB... IF THERE WAS STRESS BOTHERING YOU... YOU COULD HAVE RAISED THAT CONCERN WITH YOUR BOSS...THE ABOVE BEHAVIOR MAY HAVE GIVEN AN IMPRESSION THAT YOU ARE BEING TOO REACTIVE IN YOUR APPROACH... However, at that time, I thought that maybe I was affected by the post-covid so I was still a bit tired, my mind was a bit hazy, and I really didn't have any plans for the future. Though I do not have too much money to take a long break. So then I agreed. I decided to give it up to have some time to rest. So far, I still feel confused. I feel like I'm not ready for this break, it's like a rash decision to follow reason. I have talked to myself: I know my action comes from being too attached to responsibilities, being too harsh on myself, and at the same time it comes from being a high ego when I want to suggest quitting before my boss made a clear decision because I didn't want to be the passive recipient of that decision. ALSO IN AN UNCONSCIOUS SUBTLE WAY... THIS ALSO APPEARS TO BE A WAY FOR YOU TO ESCAPE FROM YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND DIFFICULTIES IN A %...YES IT IS IMPORTANT TO BALANCE WORK AND LIFE BUT IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO BE PRACTICAL IN YOUR DECISION MAKING... YOU COULD HAVE QUESTIONED YOURSELF - WAS THERE NO OTHER WAY APART FROM RESIGNING TO HANDLE YOUR CHALLENGES? And the fact that, when the decision was issued company-wide, people completely did not know why I was in a high management position, working full-time and being transferred to a part-time position and managing a small project. Outsiders would probably think this was a punishment. And after giving it out, everyone was surprised and asked me. But I also don't want to say why. AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO EVERYONE IN DETAILS... AND SIMPLY SAY THAT YOU WANTED TO EXPERIMENT SOMETHING ELSE... IT IS BETTER NOT TO ENTER IN TOO MUCH EXPLANATION IN THIESE MOMENTS... AND IT IS OK SOMETIMES TO TONE DOWN THE WORKLOAD SO AS TO DEAL WITH ISSUES IN A BALANCED WAY... BUT IT SHOULD BE DONE IN AN ANGELIC AND PROGRESSIVE WAY...IF YOU HAD ASKED FOR GUIDANCE WITHOUT RESIGNING... MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE GOT THE SAME OPTION (AS GIVEN BY YOUR BOSS NOW) TO GIVE YOU A BREATHER... SO THAT YOU CAN RECHARGE YOUR BATTERIES AND TAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITIES AGAIN...THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRACIOUS AND NICE WAY TO TRANSITION TO THE NEW PART-TIME ROLE WITHOUT CREATING ANY RIPPLES. WE FEEL, YOUR BOSS WAS BEING KIND TO NOT LET YOU GO AND INSTEAD SHOWED GOOD EMPATHY BY OFFERING A PART-TIME JOB... IN TODAY'S COMPETITIVE WORLD, IT IS NORMAL FOR COMPANIES TO LET GO SOME PEOPLE AND REPLACE THEM WITH FRESH TALENT OR OUTSOURCE SUCH ROLES TO OTHERS... INSTEAD HE RECOGNIZED YOUR QUALITES AND CAPABILITIES AND WAS ABLE TO RETAIN YOU BY OFFERING A PART-TIME PROJECT... THIS WAY HE IS GIVING YOU TIME TO BALANCE YOURSELF AND FIND ANOTHER JOB WITHOUT LOSING ALL YOUR EXPENSES... WHICH IS A WONDERFUL THING AND SOMETHING TO BE GRATEFUL FOR Besides me, there were also personnel adjustments in 2 other positions [- these are 2 girls, so they are parts of my feminine energy. I show I had adjusted a little the way I recept ] , which are personnel in my team, and these two were proposed and handled by me before finishing full-time work. The reason I left the company was because I wanted to stop, I realized that I did this job just for the money, but while I personally thought the job industry, the boss's way of thinking and everyone was not suitable for me. The fact that they do blockchain, launches a lot of projects just for money without bringing a real value to the community or yes but it hasn't become reality. At the same time, in the current environment and colleagues do not have much expertise and they only need to do things that have been done for a long time, even they do not understand too much about this blockchain industry. So when working with them, I find myself being dissolved, not learning more about skills or professional knowledge, but also being dragged into an unscientific way of working. And I cannot afford to drag them along even though I'm their leader. I also realized that I did not do the right thing.WE UNDERSTAND THAT DEAR NHU AND IN THE LONG TERM IT IS OK TO THINK LIKE THIS. HOWEVER, YOU ALSO NEED TO BE LOOK AT THE SITUATION PRACTICALLY... AS YOU 19/08/2025, 21:44 Move to part-time position | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/102440 2/3 SHARED YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH MONEY/RESOURCES LEFT WITH YOU... THIS MEANS, EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, YOU STILL NEEDED THAT JOB BECAUSE YOUR SITUATION IS TOO MUCH ON SURVIVAL MODE OTHERWISE... HAVING DIFFERENT LIFE PARAMETERS, IT COULD HAVE BEEN OK TO LEAVE WITHOUT CREATING TOO MANY DIRECT PRESSURES ON "FINDING MONEY" TO LIVE... IN PARALLEL YOU COULD HAVE SEARCHED FOR AVENUES THAT MATCHED YOUR THINKING PROCESS... IN CORPORATE WORLD THERE IS A SAYING THAT 'ONE CANNOT CHOOSE HIS BOSS OR FOR THAT MATTER HIS TEAM'...YOUR BOSS, YOUR TEAM IS A REFLECTION OF YOUR OWN RESONANCE...BY RESIGNING TOO QUICKLY, YOUR ARE RUNNING AWAY FROM THIS... ALSO YOU CAN NEVER BE SURE WHAT KIND OF BOSS OR TEAM YOU WILL GET TO WORK WITH, IN YOUR FUTURE ORGANIZATIONS... SO YOU SEE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO KEEP DISTANCING YOURSELF FOR THESE RESONANCES EVERY TIME. THAT BEING SAID, IT IS NOT DRAMATIC EITHER, AND IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES FOR SOME TIME IT IS OK... AND YOU CAN REACT WELL AND FIND A JOB SOON IF YOU WISH... BUT DO NOT EXPECT TO HAVE THE DREAM JOB DIRECTLY IN THE NEXT ONE... CONTINUE YOUR BEAUTIFUL INNER WORK, WHILE BEING READY TO DO SOMETHING MORE SIMPLE, THAT FITS BETTER WITH YOUR VALUES... OR DO SOMETHING FOR THE TIME TO STABILIZE YOUR FINANCIAL SITUATION... BLOCKCHAIN AS A TECH SOLUTION IS IN A VERY EXPERIMENTAL AND NASCENT STAGE... MOST OF THE APPLICATIONS ARE CONCEPTUAL AS OF NOW (APART FROM DIGITAL CURRENCIES THAT ARE USED IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES)... MOST OF THESE HAVE NOT YET BEEN PRACTICALLY IMPLEMEMNTED BECAUSE OF CERTAIN LIMITATIONS... AND IT ATTRACTS ALSO A LOT OF PEOPLE WANTING TO GET FAST MONEY WITH CRYPTOS.... WITHOUT DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR MECHANISMS.... SO YOU SEE, IN WHICHEVER COMPANY YOU WORK WITH, WHEN IT COMES TO BLOCKCHAIN... IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT MOST OF THE TIMES THE APPLICATIONS/SOLUTIONS ARE VERY HIGH LEVEL, EXPERIMENTAL WITHOUT MUCH OF VALUE ADD IN CONCRETE REALITY AS YET... BUT THIS IS THE SITUATION EVERYWHERE... AS WE PROGRESS IN FUTURE THESE TECHNOLIGIES WILL ALSO EVOLVE AND WILL FIND THEIR WAY TOWARDS PRACTICAL USES... SO IF YOU FEEL YOUR CURRENT ORGANIZATION DOES NOT PROVIDE REAL - VALUE TO THE COMMUNITY, THEN YOU CAN INNOVATE AND PROPOSE WAYS TO FIND A SOLUTION...IT CAN BE AN OPPORTUNITY ISTEAD OF BEING A DIFFICULTY... THAT BEING SAID, IF YOU PREFER TO FIND A JOB IN ANOTHER FIELD IT IS ALSO YOUR CHOICE... BUT EVERYTHING ALWAYS HAS ITS + AND - ... This shows that I have 1 % of comparing, judging others, lacking the ability to lead, influence and train others. I lack recognition, have low self- esteem inside, being too strict with myself and those around me, lack tolerance and love for myself. I realized that I took this job partly because I realized that everyone treated each other like brothers in the family, the boss treated employees very well, always putting the interests of the team first. This is also very true with my working mindset. However, since I joined a full-time company and a restructuring company, everything has changed. I found my resonance in the way the company and my boss changed. Now my boss cares a lot about health, and stops working day and night. Although I had talked to my boss before, at that time, perhaps his health had not been affected much, my boss still did not really understand and follow. PLEASE REFER TO YOUR SHARING IN THE PR WHERE YOU MENTIONED ABOUT YOUR PARENTS, SISTER ETC..IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY...EVEN YOUR BEHAVIOR TOWARDS YOUR BOSS AND TEAM WAS A BIT LIKE HOW YOU HAVE BEEN TREATED BY YOUR FAMILY WHEN IT COMES TO DECISION MAKING...ITS THE SAME RESONANCE WHICH YOU CAN WORK UPON IF YOU WISH... ALSO THE HAMMERING OF THE GATE TO BE PUT BACK IN ITS PLACE (AS EXPLAINED IN PR)... ITS LIKE YOU ARE PUSHING AND FORCING TOWARDS OBSELETE WAYS OF PROTECTION...NOW PERHAPS IT IS TIME TO UPGRADE THE INNER CODES DEAR INITIATE AND WE KNOW THAT YOU HAVE WONDERFUL POTENTIAL TO DO IT... THANK YOU FOR YOUR OPENNESS IN SHARING, YOU HAVE SHOWN AMAZING RECEPTIVITY... WISHING YOU WONDERFUL TRANSFORMATIONS WITH ANGELS MENADEL AND ACHAIAH ANGELIC REGARDS ALEXIS

WHICH IS A WONDERFUL THING AND SOMETHING TO BE GRATEFUL FOR Besides me, there were also personnel adjustments in 2 other positions [- these are 2 girls, so they are parts of my feminine energy. I show I had adjusted a little the way I recept ] , which are personnel in my team, and these two were proposed and handled by me before finishing full-time work. The reason I left the company was because I wanted to stop, I realized that I did this job just for the money, but while I personally thought the job industry, the boss's way of thinking and everyone was not suitable for me. The fact that they do blockchain, launches a lot of projects just for money without bringing a real value to the community or yes but it hasn't become reality. At the same time, in the current environment and colleagues do not have much expertise and they only need to do things that have been done for a long time, even they do not understand too much about this blockchain industry. So when working with them, I find myself being dissolved, not learning more about skills or professional knowledge, but also being dragged into an unscientific way of working. And I cannot afford to drag them along even though I'm their leader. I also realized that I did not do the right thing.WE UNDERSTAND THAT DEAR NHU AND IN THE LONG TERM IT IS OK TO THINK LIKE THIS. HOWEVER, YOU ALSO NEED TO BE LOOK AT THE SITUATION PRACTICALLY... AS YOU 19/08/2025, 21:44 Move to part-time position | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/102440 2/3 SHARED YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH MONEY/RESOURCES LEFT WITH YOU... THIS MEANS, EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, YOU STILL NEEDED THAT JOB BECAUSE YOUR SITUATION IS TOO MUCH ON SURVIVAL MODE OTHERWISE... HAVING DIFFERENT LIFE PARAMETERS, IT COULD HAVE BEEN OK TO LEAVE WITHOUT CREATING TOO MANY DIRECT PRESSURES ON \"FINDING MONEY\" TO LIVE... IN PARALLEL YOU COULD HAVE SEARCHED FOR AVENUES THAT MATCHED YOUR THINKING PROCESS... IN CORPORATE WORLD THERE IS A SAYING THAT 'ONE CANNOT CHOOSE HIS BOSS OR FOR THAT MATTER HIS TEAM'...YOUR BOSS, YOUR TEAM IS A REFLECTION OF YOUR OWN RESONANCE...BY RESIGNING TOO QUICKLY, YOUR ARE RUNNING AWAY FROM THIS... ALSO YOU CAN NEVER BE SURE WHAT KIND OF BOSS OR TEAM YOU WILL GET TO WORK WITH, IN YOUR FUTURE ORGANIZATIONS... SO YOU SEE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO KEEP DISTANCING YOURSELF FOR THESE RESONANCES EVERY TIME. THAT BEING SAID, IT IS NOT DRAMATIC EITHER, AND IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES FOR SOME TIME IT IS OK... AND YOU CAN REACT WELL AND FIND A JOB SOON IF YOU WISH... BUT DO NOT EXPECT TO HAVE THE DREAM JOB DIRECTLY IN THE NEXT ONE... CONTINUE YOUR BEAUTIFUL INNER WORK, WHILE BEING READY TO DO SOMETHING MORE SIMPLE, THAT FITS BETTER WITH YOUR VALUES... OR DO SOMETHING FOR THE TIME TO STABILIZE YOUR FINANCIAL SITUATION... BLOCKCHAIN AS A TECH SOLUTION IS IN A VERY EXPERIMENTAL AND NASCENT STAGE... MOST OF THE APPLICATIONS ARE CONCEPTUAL AS OF NOW (APART FROM DIGITAL CURRENCIES THAT ARE USED IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES)... MOST OF THESE HAVE NOT YET BEEN PRACTICALLY IMPLEMEMNTED BECAUSE OF CERTAIN LIMITATIONS... AND IT ATTRACTS ALSO A LOT OF PEOPLE WANTING TO GET FAST MONEY WITH CRYPTOS.... WITHOUT DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR MECHANISMS.... SO YOU SEE, IN WHICHEVER COMPANY YOU WORK WITH, WHEN IT COMES TO BLOCKCHAIN... IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT MOST OF THE TIMES THE APPLICATIONS/SOLUTIONS ARE VERY HIGH LEVEL, EXPERIMENTAL WITHOUT MUCH OF VALUE ADD IN CONCRETE REALITY AS YET... BUT THIS IS THE SITUATION EVERYWHERE... AS WE PROGRESS IN FUTURE THESE TECHNOLIGIES WILL ALSO EVOLVE AND WILL FIND THEIR WAY TOWARDS PRACTICAL USES... SO IF YOU FEEL YOUR CURRENT ORGANIZATION DOES NOT PROVIDE REAL - VALUE TO THE COMMUNITY, THEN YOU CAN INNOVATE AND PROPOSE WAYS TO FIND A SOLUTION...IT CAN BE AN OPPORTUNITY ISTEAD OF BEING A DIFFICULTY... THAT BEING SAID, IF YOU PREFER TO FIND A JOB IN ANOTHER FIELD IT IS ALSO YOUR CHOICE... BUT EVERYTHING ALWAYS HAS ITS + AND - ... This shows that I have 1 % of comparing, judging others, lacking the ability to lead, influence and train others. I lack recognition, have low self- esteem inside, being too strict with myself and those around me, lack tolerance and love for myself. I realized that I took this job partly because I realized that everyone treated each other like brothers in the family, the boss treated employees very well, always putting the interests of the team first. This is also very true with my working mindset. However, since I joined a full-time company and a restructuring company, everything has changed. I found my resonance in the way the company and my boss changed. Now my boss cares a lot about health, and stops working day and night. Although I had talked to my boss before, at that time, perhaps his health had not been affected much, my boss still did not really understand and follow. PLEASE REFER TO YOUR SHARING IN THE PR WHERE YOU MENTIONED ABOUT YOUR PARENTS, SISTER ETC..IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY...EVEN YOUR BEHAVIOR TOWARDS YOUR BOSS AND TEAM WAS A BIT LIKE HOW YOU HAVE BEEN TREATED BY YOUR FAMILY WHEN IT COMES TO DECISION MAKING...ITS THE SAME RESONANCE WHICH YOU CAN WORK UPON IF YOU WISH... ALSO THE HAMMERING OF THE GATE TO BE PUT BACK IN ITS PLACE (AS EXPLAINED IN PR)... ITS LIKE YOU ARE PUSHING AND FORCING TOWARDS OBSELETE WAYS OF PROTECTION...NOW PERHAPS IT IS TIME TO UPGRADE THE INNER CODES DEAR INITIATE AND WE KNOW THAT YOU HAVE WONDERFUL POTENTIAL TO DO IT... THANK YOU FOR YOUR OPENNESS IN SHARING, YOU HAVE SHOWN AMAZING RECEPTIVITY... WISHING YOU WONDERFUL TRANSFORMATIONS WITH ANGELS MENADEL AND ACHAIAH ANGELIC REGARDS ALEXIS",

title_pdf: Fear. last case id: C0217. PDF text: Dream date: Thursday, 20 October 2022 Angel: 30 Omael Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello Professor ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU This week I chanted Angel Omael with the question: Why do I have depression? OK... IF YOU WISH YOU CAN ALSO READ ABOUT THIS SYMBOL IN THE SOURCE CODE DICTIONARY...IT WILL HELP YOU TO GET MORE AWARENESS AND THE UNDERLYING REASONS ... I couldn't remember dreams, so I will analyze some events that happen this week. I met a friend - Thu [- a part of my feminine , she is too simple, too rational and thinks logically, emotional dependencies, high ego, superiority complex, need to be recognized, lacks understanding of the law of resonance and the law of karma, tendency to manipulate the psychology of others ] . She flew from another city to Ho Chi Minh City for business travel. Thu told me about the trouble of her with her girlfriend - Tram [- a part of my feminine, she thinks too much, superiority and inferiority complex, too many material needs, need to recognition, lack inner love, too attached to responsibilities, high ego, tend to pressure put perspective, perfectionist, lazy, tend to want to live the life of a hermit, run away ] , especially, Tram got medicine for depression a few years ago. Tram also overthinking like me. It's hard to make decisions or actions because she is stuck with thoughts about everything around the job like risk, how, result, why,... Tram compares herself to others. She wants to do the jobs that she loves, but she can't do them because there aren't so many chances in her hometown. When doing other jobs, she feels unsatisfied and she has frank, childish thoughts when talking to her boss. She is afraid to leave her hometown to go to the big city where there are more job opportunities. She always wondered why there are so many people who can both do what they love and earn enough money to support themselves and live the way they want. Therefore, now she's been out of school for a few years but still can't support herself. She is still dependent on her family. This caused her to put a lot of pressure on herself. I've noticed that she often overstates the issue, and I've noticed that often people who have a lot of thoughts that cause depression have a lot of thoughts, most of them negative. In those thoughts, there are logical and illogical things, but all are possible. THE UNIVERSE HAS ARRANGED FOR YOU TO MEET YOUR OWN RESONANCE, DEAR NHU... UP ABOVE LOVES YOU SO MUCH AND SYNCHRONIZED THIS MEETING SO THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT IT LIKE AN OBSERVER... SOMETIMES WHEN A PERSON IS LIVING A SITUATION, HE/SHE CAN BECOME BIASED OR TOO INVOLVED LEADING TO FEELINGS OF VICTIMHOOD...BUT WHEN HE/SHE LOOKS AT THE SAME SITUATION FOR OTHERS (AS AN OBSERVER), THERE IS DETACHMENT AND CLARITY... SO HERE YOU CAN SEE HOW A PART OF YOU CAN SOMETIMES BE DEAR NHU, IN YOUR STATE OF DEPRESSION... LACK OF DISCERNMENT, CONFUSION ETC... ALWAYS REMEMBER YOU WILL PUT IN SITUATIONS (WHETHER JOB OR OTHERWISE), THAT ARE NEEDED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR SOUL. SO EVEN IF YOU ARE IN A JOB THAT YOU DO NOT LIKE... DON'T FIGHT IT... ACCEPT IT... ASK FROM THE UNIVERSE WHAT IS IT THAT YOU HAVE TO LEARN FROM THIS SITUATIONS... YOU WILL BE SHOWN RESONANCES THROUGH DREAMS AND REAL SITUATIONS THAT YOU NEED TO WORK ON... AND WHEN THE CLEANSING HAPPENS, IN A VERY SMOOTH AND NICE WAY, THE UNIVERSE WILL ORGANIZE YOUR EXIT FROM THE CURRENT JOB AND WILL PLACE YOU TO THE NEXT SITUATION... WORKING ON YOURSELF IS A FULL-TIME JOB ... THE MORE YOU KEEP RESOLVING YOUR INNER RESONANCES, THE MORE YOUR OUTER SITUATIONS SHALL GET REARRANGED FOR BETTER POSSIBILITIES... THE BEST PART IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT ALL, IT'S THE JOB OF THE ANGELS TO SYNCHRONIZE EVERYTHING, AND IT'S UP TO YOU TO BE RECEPTIVE TO THIS FORCE OF HELP THAT IS ALWAYS THERE, TO DO THE STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION...YOUR FOCUS IS ONLY TOWARDS SELF WORK WITH A LOT OF PATIENCE AND HUMILITY I feel like the universe is answering my question a few weeks ago: how can I use DSSI knowledge to understand my depression? I find knowledge too abstract and impractical to understand and apply. I find myself having above things too, so I find myself often having thoughts that are contrary to the majority, things that rarely happen to me are still very normal. KNOWLEDGE REMAINS ABSTRACT TILL THE TIME IT IS IN YOUR THOUGHTS LIKE A CONCEPT... BUT EVENTUALLY YOU WILL EXPERIENCE CHANGE ONLY WHEN YOU APPLY IT IN THE CONCRETE... ELSE IT WILL BECOME AN INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY AND MAY NOT USHER IN REAL TRANSFORMATION. Thu couldn't help Tram, so they argued and Thu lost a lot of sleep. I explained to Thu that she was emotionally dependent on Tram and that she needed to expand her empathy about Tram's problems to understand Tram better, talk to Tram more gently, more slowly, not too rigidly, as well as gradually guide Tram to listen to herself. And to do that, Thu needs to change herself, and also heal herself to not be dependent and attached to others. Thu also listens and agrees with me that she will try to learn and change. I told Thu that change is not easy and fast, so don't expect quick change or count the time, but follow her own rhythm and accept it. SO YOU SEE HERE...WHEN YOU APPROACHED THE SAME SITUATION AS AN OBSERVER ... YOU WERE ABLE TO GUIDE AND SUGGEST HELP ON HOW TO CHANGE AND HANDLE THE SITUATION... SO IN A WAY YOU ARE ALSO TELLING THIS TO A PART OF YOU WHICH NEEDS TO LEARN EMOTIONAL BALANCE, NEEDS TO HAVE EMPATHY FOR SELF AND OTHERS ... MORE IMPORTANTLY TRY TO VIEW THE SITUATION FROM OTHER'S VIEWPOINT AS WELL AND NOT ALWAYS FROM YOUR OWN PERSPECTIVE. The next day, I was attending a live session with Professor Haritha about Lucid Dream SYMBOLICALLY SPEAKING YOU ARE LEARNING ABOUT A STATE WHICH IS SOMEWHAT IN TRANSITION FROM A CONSCIOUSNESS OF CONCRETE REALITY TO DEEPER REALMS OF THE WORLD OF DREAMS...IT IS LIKE AN IN-BETWEEN STATE...SOMETHING LIKE WHAT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING IN YOUR LIFE.. SO WHEN YOU ARE IN THIS KIND OF A STATE YOU CAN SOMETIMES LOSE CONNECTION WITH MULTIPLE IMPORTANT PARTS OF YOU (LIKE FAMILY)... AS THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO REACH YOU...I.E. SOMETIMES YOU CAN BLOCK YOURSELF SURROUNDED BY YOUR OWN SITUATION SO MUCH THAT SOMETIMES YOU ARE NOT ABLE PERCIEVE OTHER PEOPLE'S LOVE AND CARE FOR YOU...YOU CAN INTROSPECT ON THIS DEAR NHU.... AS SHARED BY YOU, YOUR PARENTS, FAMILY CAN SOMETIMES BE TOO STERN BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD ALSO TRY TO DISCOVER AND RECIEVE THE UNDERLYING LOVE AND CARE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE FOR YOU . At the end of the session when I opened my phone, I accidentally saw a lot of missed calls [- represents the disconnection from surrounding parts and society. Here it shows me that I am in a phase of disconnection from my inner parts (calls from family) that I am the one who intentionally disconnects (turns off the phone). The minus point is that I lack inner communication to understand inner problems, I lack the receptivity to be able to communicate, and I have fears / psychological obstacles so I cannot connect clearly with myself YES BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS LOGICAL TO SHUT DOWN YOUR PHONE DURING A CONFERENCE, OTHERWISE IT COULD DISTURB OTHERS IF YOU TEXT OR HAVE A CALL DURING THE SESSION... 😇 IF THERE WAS NO EMERGENCY, IT'S OK... BUT IF YOU KNOW THAT YOU WILL HAVE AN IMPORTANT CALL OR THAT YOUR FATHER / MOTHER IS SICK AND NEED ASSISTANCE FOR EXAMPLE, THEN YOU NEED TO LET IT ON... IT DEPENDS ON THE SITUATION, BUT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE YOUR PHONE SHUT DOWN FOR 1-2 HOURS IF THERE IS NO EMERGENCY AS WELL :) AND YOU SEE YOUR RESONANCE WITH TRAM HERE... BECAUSE A LOT OF MISSED CALLS FROM YOUR FAMILY FOR JUST 2 HOURS OF ABSENCE CAN SHOW TOO MUCH DEPENDENCY TO THEM... PREVENTING YOU TO BE WELL INDEPENDENT SOMETIMES... ] from my parents and sister. People texted me and asked what I was doing and couldn't get through. It was late at night and the class wasn't over yet, so I turned off the phone to wait for the end of the class. Right now I am really worried and scared. I don't know why everyone is looking for me at the same time. I think about the fact that I just stopped my full-time job and switched to part-time without telling my family. I waited for it to settle down before speaking. Because my work problems often hurt my parents when I changed jobs many times without being stable. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU TELL THEM ANYWAY... BUT PRESENT IT IN A CONSTRUCTIVE WAY... SAY THAT YOU ARE LOOKING ACTIVELY FOR A NEW JOB, THAT YOU ARE LIVING A BEAUTIFUL RENEWAL INSIDE OF YOU AND THAT YOU NEEDED THIS CHANGE... IF YOU ARE WELL ALIGNED WITH THIS DECISION AND WELL CONCRETE AS WELL, YOUR FREQUENCY WILL BE SOLID IN FRONT OF THEM ALSO... I said to myself right now: calm down, it's not necessarily that, but if I'm right (if my parents accidentally find out) I will also be honest about the problem and I will accept my situation openly and honestly, without deception, and talk to my parents as gently and sincerely 19/08/2025, 21:45 Fear | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/102775 2/3 as possible so that they understand. The class ended, and it rained heavily, I took the opportunity to go home. After I settled down, I texted each family member that I was home late at night and didn't turn on my phone at night. The next morning, I took the initiative to call my mother again and talk about going to class of meditation and not answering the phone. And my mother replied with a smile that she hadn't seen me in a while, so she was suddenly worried that something had happened to me (at this time, I am happy and relieved because it is no big deal.) I explained to my mother. That day was Vietnamese Women's Day (an annual celebration for women in Vietnam), so I asked my mother a little and wished her a happy day. YOU REPAIRED BEAUTIFULLY HERE... IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO LET OUR LOVED ONES WITHOUT NEWS FOR A TOO LONG TIME... My father and sister also gently asked about me. YES... WONDERFUL... YOU CAN REFER TO WHAT WE HAVE MENTIONED ABOVE... THEY WERE JUST CONCERNED ABOUT YOU BUT YOU COULD NOT PERCIEVE IT THEN AS YOU GOT INFLUENCED BY YOUR OWN POINT OF VIEW Then I feel really thank you. I think I've stepped deeper into self-acceptance and healing. Before I was very afraid and negative when talking to my family about my problems, I mostly kept it a secret and didn't want them to know because I didn't feel their understanding and sympathy. But now I am gradually more open, and more receptive, and the feeling of fear is also much less. YES THIS A WONDERFUL STEP FORWARD... ACCEPTANCE IS ALWAYS THE FIRST STEP TO RESOLVE DIFFICULTIES AND CONFUSIONS... Thank you WISHING YOU ANGELIC REVELATIONS AND TRANSFORMATIONS WITH ANGELS OMAEL AND HAZIEL ANGELIC REGARDS ALEXIS

title_pdf: Reparation gift. last case id: C0218. PDF text: Dream date: Thursday, 27 October 2022 Angel: 8 Cahetel Dream and Analysis: Angelic Hello Professor ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU I chanted Angel Cahetel from the Retreat about 4 elements Earth, Water, Fire, and Air with Professor Haritha & Santhosh. My intention is: please help me transform the blockage of ability for materialization. OK... WONDERFUL INTENTION My mother [- the origin of my feminine polarity (SO PAST MEMORIES OF THE WAY YOU FEEL SOMETIMES), imposing, manipulative, aggressive, talkative, lacks empathy and tolerance, has high material needs, lacks recognition, like to show off, superiority and inferiority complex, lack of receptivity, tends to action too much ] needed to atone for a man (in middle age, not too old) [- a UNCONSCIOUS part of my masculine polarity (ACTION WORLD), belongs to the unconscious. It expresses my instinctual need, lack inner love, has excessive need for intimacy, tends to seek out compensation for love, tends to abuse of power and authority, imposing opinion ] by taking a woman to spend the night with him. IN THIS DREAM YOU ARE CONNECTING WITH YOUR MEMORIES OF ORIGIN WHICH ARE LINKED WITH EXTREMISM, ANCIENT SPIRITUALITY, LACK OF DISCERNMENT, INFIDELITY & SEXUAL NEEDS AND NOTIONS OF ILLUSORY/FALSE BELIEFS...AS YOU KNOW THAT DIVINE JUSTICE IS ABSOLUTE - WE REAP WHAT WE SOW... HENCE, IN A WAY REAL ATONEMENT HAPPENS WHEN A PERSON LEARNS FROM PAST ERRORS, IS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND CLEANSE SUCH NEGATIVE MEMORIES AND PROGRESSES TOWARDS QUALITIES. YOU CANNOT TRANSFER OR PROJECT THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR ACTION TO OTHERS... HERE YOUR INNER MOTHER IS PRACTICING ATONEMENT BY INTENDING TO SEND SOME OTHER WOMAN (WHICH LATER HAPPENS TO BE YOU)... EVEN YOUR INNER UNCONSCIOUS MAN IS NOT QUESTIONING IT...THESE ARE MEMORIES OF MANIPULATIONS AND ABUSING CERTAIN PRACTICES TO FULFIL ONE'S OWN INSTINCTUAL NEEDS... IT IS NOT RIGHT TO ATONE FOR A WRONG ACTION BY DOING ANOTHER WRONG ACTION... IN A % SUCH TRACES/SEEDS OF EXTREMISM ETC. CAN INFLUENCE YOUR BEHAVIOR, DECISION MAKING ETC. WHICH CAN BE DRIVEN BY BASE NEEDS AND DESIRES, ILLUSORY SENSE OF ATONEMENT ETC. LEADING TO LACK OF DISCERNMENT, BEING SELF-CENTERED.... ALSO THIS DEPICTS MEMORIES OF WRONG SEXUALITY, NEEDS, LACK OF LOVE WHICH CAN SOMETIMES GET MIXED UP WITH SPIRITUAL ASPECTS SO AS JUSTIFY WRONG ACTIONS SO AS TO FEEL RIGHTEOUS... OF COURSE THIS REMAINS JUST A %, AND IT DOESN'T MEAN IT WILL BE EXPRESSED IN YOU IN THE SAME FORM THAN IN THE DREAM... BUT IT CAN BE FOR EXAMPLE TRYING TO PLEASE THE OTHER'S AFFECTIVE NEEDS TOO MUCH WHEN YOU HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG... LIKE BEING TOO KIND OR GENTLE WITH A PERSON THAT YOU HAD A PROBLEM WITH, TO COMPENSATE THE DISTURBANCE... WE CAN SEE THIS IN COMPANIES SOMETIMES, WHERE AN EMPLOYEE WILL START TO BE TOO KIND WITH THEIR MANAGER AFTER A TENSED CONVERSATION... IT IS LIKE THEY WANT TO ATONE BUT BY NOURISHING THE NEEDS OF THE OTHER TOO MUCH... WHICH SHOWS TOO MUCH SUBMISSION TO THEIR NEEDS TO BE LOVED... My femininity is having too much emissivity, a lack of listening, a tendency to act according to the tendency to impose, too strong, to abuse power to gain recognition. I tend to look for love from the outside to compensate for an overwhelming inner deficiency, so even I have the energy to abuse power and force to get that. Mom talked to me, and I was surprised. I don't really agree but I did, maybe to help my mom. Mom and I prepared to go to that man's house. I decided to go by myself. YES... SO YOU SEE HERE, YOU DID NOT AFFIRM YOURSELF WELL... TENDENCIES TO IMPRESS AND PLEASE OTHERS BECAME MORE POWERFUL AND DID NOT LET YOU QUESTION THIS ACTION... THIS ALSO REFLECTS NOTIONS OF FOLLOWING WRONG AUTHORITY... SOMETIMES IN THE NAME OF HELPING AND PLEASING OTHERS YOU CAN MIX UP YOUR OWN NEEDS LEADING TO WRONG DECISIONS My father [- lack of love expression for children, non-talkative, conservative, obstinate, infidelity SYMBOL OF ORIGIN RELATED TO YOUR MASCULINE POLARITY (WORLD OF ACTIONS) ] was also out at this time, so he suggested driving me. I refused and reasoned that I still had unfinished preparations so that I would go later. Mom didn't want dad to know, so I kept it a secret. A LACK OF ALIGNMENT IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU FEEL AND WHAT YOU DO... YOU AND YOUR INNER MOTHER KNOW IT IS WRONG (EVEN IN THE NAME OF ATONEMENT) ELSE THERE IS NO REASON TO HIDE IT FROM YOUR INNER FATHER, BUT STILL YOU GO AHEAD WITH IT...THIS ALSO DEPICTS NOTIONS OF BEING SELF-CENTERED THAT YOUR INNER MOTHER (PART OF YOU) IS OK TO PUT YOUR OWN DAUGHTER (ANOTHER ASPECT OF YOU) IN LINE FOR YOUR OWN NEEDS... MANIPULATION AND LACK OF TRUST IN YOUR INNER COUPLE ASPECT WHICH CAN SOMETIMES IMBALANCE YOUR POLARITIES TOO... THE DREAM SO FAR ALSO VERY IMPORTANTLY REVEALS THE WRONG CODES OF SEXUALITY AND COUPLE ASPECT IN YOU AT THE VERY ORIGIN... SUCH MEMORIES OF ABUSE, SEXUAL DESIRES, WRONGS EXPERIMENTATIONS ... CAN ALSO BE THE CAUSE OF YOUR EXPERIMENT WITH LESBIANISM IN THIS LIFE DEAR NHU... YOU SEE IN THIS DREAM BOTH THE SYMBOLS OF MASCULINE POLARITY (ACTION) ARE NOT RIGHT OR ARE NOT ALERT ENOUGH TO ENSURE RIGHT AFFIRMATION IN ACTION... ON THE CONTRARY IT IS YOUR FEMININE POLARITY (EMOTIONAL NEEDS) WHICH HAS A HIGHER LEVEL OF INFLUENCE ON YOU THEREBY MAKING YOU MORE INCLINED AND IN NEED FOR MORE AND MORE FEMININE ASPECTS .... SUCH CODES OF MANIPULATION, INFIDELITY, LACK OF LOVE, ILLUSORY SPIRITUALITY MIXED WITH NEEDS, ABUSE OF TRUST/RESPECT ETC. CAN UNCONSCIOUSLY MAKE YOU NOT LIKE /OR NOT BE INCLINED TOWARDS FUSION WITH THE MASCULINE ASPECT I tend to hide the wrong things about myself and don't tell outsiders, maybe I'm afraid of being judged or being known by others. At the moment, in reality, I woke up, I decided to go back to sleep and chanted in my head the angel Cahetel. WONDERFUL... YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL COURAGE TO EXPLORE THESE MEMORIES 😇 Then, I continue to dream. I went to that man's house. It's a pretty clean, spacious apartment, almost everything is white. I'm quite surprised. Inwardly I want to have a really pure, comfortable intimacy. BUT IT IS WRONG INTIMACY HERE DEAR NHU... HERE IT IS NOT ORIGINATING FROM THE BEAUTIFUL FEELING OF LOVE...ON THE CONTRARY IT IS BEING DONE AS AN ACT OF ATONEMENT (I.E. FEELING OF GUILT, PLEASING OTHERS ETC.)... SO THE WHITE HERE IS TO BE CONSIDERED ON THE MINUS I.E. ASPECT OF ILLUSION... SPACIOUS ALSO MEANS NOTIONS OF BEING TOO AIRY AND BEING IN SUPERIORITY COMPLEX, THE NEGATIVE ASPECT OF THE WHITE COLOR THAT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL BUT IS A FACADE TO SHINE (OF YOUR INNER UNCONSCIOUS MAN) I cook for this man. While we were eating, this man walked past me and started kissing me. Then, he led me to the bedroom. I had no resistance. HERE IT FEELS AN ESSENCE OF SERVING INSTEAD OF LOVING... ITS LIKE HOW SOMETIMES PRIESTS OR NUNS IN SOME ANCIENT RELIGIOUS PRACTICES USE THEIR POSITION OF SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY TO MAKE OTHERS SERVE THEIR NEEDS IN THE NAME OF ATONEMENT, CONFESSION ETC... YOU ALSO DID NOT QUESTION OR RESIST IT... AND IT WAS NOT LIKE IT'S SOMEONE YOU KNEW FOR YEARS AND THAT HAS THEN BECOME YOUR HUSBAND.... ITS LIKE NOT ASKING YOURSELF WHETHER YOU REALLY LOVE THAT PERSON?... IT APPEARS MORE LIKE A MECHANICAL ACTIVITY MORE DRIVEN BY AFFECTIVE AND SEXUAL NEEDS OF BOTH YOU INNER MAN AS WELL AS YOURSELF... ALSO MEMORIES OF BEIG ABUSED AS WELL AS ABUSING OTHERS... And I keep waking up. 19/08/2025, 21:45 Reparation gift | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/103202 2/3 The dream shows that I have abused energy or suffered abuse in terms of power, authority to satisfy instinctive needs, or material needs (needs belonging to the animal world). I unintentionally let myself suffer, lack of attention to my body. I was aware of that a certain % because I woke up in the middle of a dream. The origin of this comes from the influence of my polarities. The masculine polarity wasn't strong enough and showed the necessary emissivity, and the feminine lack of listening to learn, balance and increase unconditional love and empathy for myself and those around me. I even indulged in the bad parts of me, tending to hide and protect them. YOU HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE ESSENCE OF THE DREAM REALLY WELL NHU...GOOD WORK ...SOMETIMES SUCH DREAMS AND REVELATION OF THESE MEMORIES CAN BE OVERWHELMING BUT DO NOT FORGET THESE ARE JUST SMALL % OF YOU AND NOT YOU ENTIRE SELF... IT IS A STRONG IMAGE TO SHOW YOU THE ORIGIN OF SUCH MEMORIES... LIKE A MAGNIFYING GLASS THAT GOES DEEP IN THE MEMORY TO HEAL IT BETTER FROM THE INSIDE :) YOU HAVE AMAZING QUALITIES AS WELL THAT YOU ARE WORKING ON SO WELL DEAR INITIATE...DREAMS LIKE THIS ARE A GIFT AS YOU COULD CONNECT WITH THE ROOT CAUSES (ORIGINS) THAT HAVE AN INFLUENCE IN YOUR CONCRETE LIFE TOO...WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP DOING YOUR SELF-WORK WITH PATIENCE AND PERSISTENCE WISHING YOU WONDERFUL TRANSCENDANCE OF NEEDS AND RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF CLEMENCY WITH ANGELS PAHALIAH AND VASARIAH ANGELIC REGARDS ALEXIS

    "dream_text": "My mother [- the origin of my feminine polarity (SO PAST MEMORIES OF THE WAY YOU FEEL SOMETIMES), imposing, manipulative, aggressive, talkative, lacks empathy and tolerance, has high material needs, lacks recognition, like to show off, superiority and inferiority complex, lack of receptivity, tends to action too much ] needed to atone for a man (in middle age, not too old) [- a UNCONSCIOUS part of my masculine polarity (ACTION WORLD), belongs to the unconscious. It expresses my instinctual need, lack inner love, has excessive need for intimacy, tends to seek out compensation for love, tends to abuse of power and authority, imposing opinion ] by taking a woman to spend the night with him. My femininity is having too much emissivity, a lack of listening, a tendency to act according to the tendency to impose, too strong, to abuse power to gain recognition. I tend to look for love from the outside to compensate for an overwhelming inner deficiency, so even I have the energy to abuse power and force to get that. Mom talked to me, and I was surprised. I don't really agree but I did, maybe to help my mom. Mom and I prepared to go to that man's house. I decided to go by myself. My father [- lack of love expression for children, non-talkative, conservative, obstinate, infidelity SYMBOL OF ORIGIN RELATED TO YOUR MASCULINE POLARITY (WORLD OF ACTIONS) ] was also out at this time, so he suggested driving me. I refused and reasoned that I still had unfinished preparations so that I would go later. Mom didn't want dad to know, so I kept it a secret. I tend to hide the wrong things about myself and don't tell outsiders, maybe I'm afraid of being judged or being known by others. At the moment, in reality, I woke up, I decided to go back to sleep and chanted in my head the angel Cahetel. Then, I continue to dream. I went to that man's house. It's a pretty clean, spacious apartment, almost everything is white. I'm quite surprised. Inwardly I want to have a really pure, comfortable intimacy. I cook for this man. While we were eating, this man walked past me and started kissing me. Then, he led me to the bedroom. I had no resistance.",

title_pdf: Disguise. last case id: C0219. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 4 November 2022 Angel: 43 Veuliah Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello Professor ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU I forgot to put an intention when I worked with Angel Veuliah this week. Here is my dream since the very first day I work with the Angel. OK :) I disguised myself as a hidden person [- a part of my unconscious, tend to run away, falsehood, dishonesty, irresponsible,inferiority complex ] to investigate a certain organization [- a part of my unconscious, scheming, ignorant of justice, tend to crime ] . There are many people outside who doubt myself and my teammates. They always want to know if I am the hidden person. YOU ARE CONNECTING WITH YOUR MEMORIES RELATED TO MATTER/WORK (ORGANIZATION SYMBOL) AND HOW SOMETIMES YOUR INNER DUALITY AND CONFLICTS CAN IMPACT YOUR WORK...IN THIS DREAM THE REASON FOR YOUR INVESTIGATION ETC. HAS NOT BEEN REVEALED... HOWEVER IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT YOU HAVE SHARED WE SHALL CONSIDER THE MINUS ASPECTS OF THE SYMBOLS PRESENTED... AT THE START IT SHOWS THAT YOU SOMETIMES HAVE A TENDENCY TO HIDE YOUR TRUE SELF (DISGUISE) FROM OTHERS... IN A % YOU WISH TO REMAIN HIDDEN SO THAT YOU CAN INVESTIGATE I.E. NOTIONS OF JUDGING OTHERS, FINDING FAULTS AND MISTAKES IN THE WAY YOUR TEAMS, ORGANIZATION WORK... OF COURSE SOMETIMES, AS AN INITIATE WE ALSO NEED TO BE A SECRET AGENT 😇 AND WE SHOULD NOT REVEAL EVERYTHING ABOUT OURSELVES AS WELL... BUT THE ENERGY OF WANTING TO BE HIDDEN HERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE THE ONE WHERE A PERSON PREFERS TO STAY AT THE BACKEND, AVOIDING THE LIMELIGHT ETC ... HERE IT IS MORE RELATED TO THE NEED TO INVESTIGATE OTHERS...DUE TO THIS OTHERS MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO TRUST YOU EASILY, THEY CAN DOUBT YOUR INTENTIONS.. FOR E.G. WHEN WE WORK IN A TEAM... THERE CAN BE PEOPLE WHO WOULD SOMETIMES LOOK FOR NEGATIVES/FAULTS IN OTHERS INSTEAD OF APPLYING RESONANCE... THERE ARE TIMES WHEN KNOWINGLY THEY WILL HIGHLIGHT MISTAKES OF OTHERS NOT WITH THE ENERGY TO IMPROVE AS A TEAM BUT INSTEAD TO SHOW THEM DOWN... THIS CAN BREAK THE UNITY OF THE TEAM... OTHERS WILL BE ENERGETICALLY ABLE TO PERCIEVE SUCH A PERSON AND WOULD NOT TRUST HIM/HER WELL. I tend to hide a part of myself, don't want to show it, maybe I'm self-deprecating because of it, don't want people to know. This part can be about personality, things, people, relationships... around me, and I want to hide it.THE DETAILS SUBMITTED BY YOU IN THE DREAM DO NOT SUGGEST NOTIONS OF SELF-DISRESPECT ...INSTEAD IT REFLECTS MORE TOWARDS YOUR FOCUS ON THE HIDDEN INVESTIGATION I lack loyalty to myself and to the people around me. Although my intentions in hiding that part may be good (investigation of a bad organization).YES AND NO... BECAUSE BEING A SECRET AGENT HERE DOES NOT BRING YOU RELEVANT INFORMATION, AND CREATES PROBLEM IN THE SCENE AFTER... HERE YOU SEE THERE ARE UNCONSCIOUS PARTS OF YOU WHO DOUBT YOU AND FEEL THAT YOU ARE THE HIDDEN PERSON WHO IS THERE TO NOTICE THEIR ERRORS AND FAULTS... SO YOU SEE SOMETIMES YOU CAN JUSTIFY YOUR ACTIONS BY FEELING THAT WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING IS FOR THE GOOD OF THE ORGANIZATION BUT THAT INTENTION MIGHT NOT ALWAYS BE TRUE... However, I also have bad actions to hide it sometimes. Even I tend to deny that part (the below part of dream: when I deny). It shows that I tend to be hard on myself, lack honesty with myself, have a certain percent of energy that doesn't comply with justice. WELL UNDERSTOOD... ALSO PLEASE REFER TO THE COMMENTS ABOVE They blocked me and one of my teammates in a house . It was a cottage, surrounded by rice fields [- represent my inner intimation structure. Rice fields represent for my inner source of energy, the energy to nourish myself, belongs feeling and emotions world. The cottage was surrounded by rice fields means I tend to self-isolation, use emotions and feelings to protect my inner world, as well as tend to be too relax, too lazy ] . And they asked me if I was the hidden person. Maybe with that disguise, I did something non-transparent, and I don't know if it's good or not. While they questioned me, I kept denying and asking for evidence. In the end, they still couldn't get the answer out, then they started to attack myself and my teammate. The two sides fought each other. THIS PART OF THE DREAMS TELLS YOU, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR COLLEAGUES/TEAMMATES CONFRONT YOU ABOUT YOUR HIDDEN INVESTIGATION...HERE ITS SHOWS 2 CONFLICTING ASPECTS IN YOU... THE FIRST PART IS YOUR INNER COLLEAGUES I.E. IN A % IN YOU , WHEN YOU COME ACROSS A SITUATION WHERE YOU FEEL YOU ARE BEING JUDGED OR INVESTIGATED BY SOMEONE, YOU CAN SOMETIMES BECOME TOO INTENSE AND AUTHORITATIVE... WHEREAS THE SECOND PART SHOWS THAT WHEN OTHERS CONFRONT YOU FOR YOUR ACTIONS YOU CAN SOMETIMES FEEL ISOLATED, VICTIMIZED AT AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL (COTTAGE SURROUNDED BY RICE FIELDS) ... EVEN SO WHEN QUESTIONED YOU STICK TO YOUR POINT AND YOU KEEP DENYING THEM... THIS CAN LEAD TO RIGIDITY, LACK OF RECEPTIVITY IN YOU BY BEING IN A STATE OF DENIAL SOMETIMES... FOR E.G. LET US SAY IN YOUR WORK AREA, IF YOUR BOSS OR TEAM MATES TRY TO QUESTION YOUR BEHAVIOR, OR SHARE WHAT IS NOT RIGHT, YOU CAN SOMETIMES REMAIN RIGID WITH YOUR OWN POINT OF VIEW AND KEEP DENYING THAT YOU HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING WRONG (IN A SMALL %)... THIS TENDENCY CAN CREATE RESISTANCE IN YOU TO APPLY RESONANCE AND REFER BACK TO SELF. I tend to be too detached with my inner SOCIAL / WORK RELATIONSHIPS couple (me and a teammate), even isolated. I tend to feed my inner initimation, inner couple with material needs (rice fields). This scene shows my lack of inner abundance, I can be confused between the concepts of "protection" and "isolation" when working with my inner initimation and inner couple. Understandably in a way, when I don't want to hurt myself, I build an emotional protective layer on the outside, I think it will protect me, but at the same time, I also isolate myself, separating myself from outer events and people. This can also manifest if I'm in a couple relationship, maybe I tend to keep my lover hidden and don't want to make it public. I had inner struggled with the desire to show myself out, public the things that I wanted to hide. I weigh the pros and cons of making it public. YOU HAVE WELL UNDERSTOOD THE ESSENCE OF SELF ISOLATION AND VICTIM ASPECT...HOWEVER THIS DREAM DOES NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION RELATED TO YOUR INNER COUPLE... ALSO PLEASE REFER TO THE COMMENTS ABOVE... BUT OF COURSE IF YOU TEND TO HIDE THE INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LOVER TO OTHERS AT WORK, THEN THIS COULD BE THE KIND OF SUBJECTS YOU COULD HIDE NOT TO BE SEEN OR JUDGED BY OTHERS... BUT BY RESONANCE YOU CAN BE AFRAID OF YOUR OWN JUDGEMENT AND SEVERITY, AS YOU SEE IN THE DREAM WITH THE PEOPLE BEING VIOLENT TO YOU FOR NOT REVEALING THE INFORMATION... SO IT IS TO HELP YOU TO BE MORE AUTHENTIC THAT YOU RECEIVE A DREAM LIKE THIS... AND FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE NOT TO REVEAL EVERYTHING ABOUT YOURSELF ALSO, AT THE OPPOSITE... BECAUSE BEHIND THE TOO MUCH, THERE IS THE NOT ENOUGH... SO IF YOU HIDE TOO MUCH, THERE ARE ALSO MEMORIES THAT COULD OPEN YOURSELF TOO MUCH TO OTHERS... SO YOU CAN CONTINUE TO FIND THE BALANCE ☯️ TO ACCEPT WHAT IS HIDDEN IN YOURSELF AND OTHERS, AND HAVE THE RIGHT TRANSPARENCY AND AUTHENTICITY WITH EVERYONE ✨ A WONDERFUL DREAM RELATED YOUR WORK MEMORIES DEAR NHU... WE WISH YOU A WONDERFUL UNDERSTANDING OF TEAM DYNAMICS, COMPASSION AND EMPATHY TOWARDS YOURSELF AND OTHERS WITH ANGELS MENADEL AND HAZIEL ANGELIC REGARDS ALEXIS

title_pdf: Da Nang trip. last case id: C0220. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 11 November 2022 Angel: 45 Sealiah Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello Professor ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU After the meeting with you, I decided to chant Sealiah with the intention: please help me know what has blocked me from enthusiasm for work in recent years. OK, A GOOD INITIATIVE... :) I have no dreams, so I decode some events in week. Last week I had a few outings to relax. So far, it was time for me to find a job, but I felt that my mood was just letting go of the old job, and now it was comfortable resting. So, although finding a new job is also urgent, I still decided to take a trip for myself. I went to Da Nang, a city with the sea and mountains. I seek to find a balance between emotion (sea) and action (mountain). I need time to balance my inner struggles to focus on external realization (work). IT IS A GOOD IDEA SOMETIMES TO TAKE AN INTERMISSION, RECHARGE YOUR BATTERIES BEFORE GETTING BACK IN ACTION... Before I boarded the plane, my glasses' base [- My global vision is broken, it can be seen that I am currently not in the mood and clearly conscious to identify the situation, I am driven by inspiration but lack of reason. I have a hard time getting a global of the situation, taking the right course of action ] accidentally fell off A GOOD ANALYSIS AND INTROSPECTION... THERE ARE NO ACCIDENTS DEAR NHU... THE SIGN WAS TO CORRECT YOUR VISION WITH RESPECT TO HOW YOU PERCIEVE OR SEE THINGS AROUND YOU...BASE ALSO PROVIDES SOLIDITY, SUPPORT...WHICH CURRENTLY EVEN FOR YOU DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE STABLE ENOUGH MATERIALLY...ONCE YOUR WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS CHANGES, THIS WILL TRIGGER TRANSFORMATION IN YOUR CONCRETE REALITY AS WELL . I still decided to wear the glasses and leave immediately because I didn't have time to fix them anymore. The days in Da Nang are really beautiful and sunny, a little chilly. When I was invited by Thu [- a part of my feminine polarity, she is generous, kind, simple in thought, clear in action, neat. Her minus points are lack of empathy, lack of insight, emotional dependence, lack of recognition. She is a lawyer. From her job, I recognize a part of the reason I met her, because I need to work with my inner justice, I need to be more rigorously, right, disciplined and consistent ] to Da Nang to play, I didn't know that she had just quit her job and had a few free days in Da Nang to hang out. Thu let me stay and take me out, I also met a few other friends in Da Nang, they also took me out and I had very comfortable conversations. I really feel that this trip is very right and is loved and supported by some friends, so I don't spend too much. I get to visit some natural scenes and see the sea, and trees, I feel they are very beautiful, even sometimes they make me emotional. The universe has arranged for me people and natural scenes with good qualities to love me, help me balance, heal, and help me to be at peace when I have time to turn inside to talk to myself. YOU FEEL AT EASE WHEN PARTS OF YOU SYMBOLIZING SUPPORT, ACCOMPANIEMENT, EMOTIONAL CONNECT ETC. GET ACTIVATED... AND OF COURSE IF IT HELPED YOU TO RELAX, SPEND A GOOD MOMENT OF REFLEXION IT IS WONDERFUL... BUT HERE YOU CAN OBSERVE YOUR INTENTION IN GOING TO THIS TRIP... BECAUSE IF YOU JUST HANG OUT WITH FRIENDS WITHOUT THINKING DEEPLY ABOUT YOUR SITUATION, IT IS AS IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SEE IT ANYMORE... THIS IS WHY YOUR GLASSES WERE BROKEN JUST BEFORE THE TRIP... TO INVITE YOU NOT TO LOOSE YOUR CONCRETE REALITY FROM SIGHT... ✨ From Da Nang, I flew back to my hometown to visit my parents. I did not stay with my parents for long, because it was quite cold in the early winter, and my body was very cold. When I got home, I was going to tell my parents about my transition to part-time, but I felt like I didn't want them to worry, and then I would find a job again soon, so I decided not to. I lack of honesty with myself, I tend to avoid, avoid, and choose a gentle solution but it does not solve the problem in the long term, but only temporarily. At the same time, I also lacked of faith in myself, or trust in my parents when I was afraid to tell this truth. ALSO THE LACK OF WARMTH WITH YOUR FAMILY RESONATED WITH THE COLD WEATHER ON THE OUTSIDE...WHILE IT IS OK TO NOT TRIGGER WORRY OR SADNESS FOR OTHERS BUT PERHAPS YOU COULD HAVE SHARED IT WITH GENTLENES, DIPLOMACY AND YET WITH AFFIRMATION... HERE ALSO IT WAS THE ESSENCE OF ESCAPING THAT LESSENED YOUR AUTHENTICITY/HONESTY WITH YOUR PARENTS...YOU COULD HAVE SAID FOR E.G "THAT THE JOB WAS TAKING A LOT OUT OF ME AND WAS NOT HELPING ME TO GROW OR DO WHAT I AIM FOR PROFESSIONALLY... I PLAN TO TAKE FEW CLASSES TO UPGRADE MY SKILLS AND HENCE CHANGED TO PART TIME ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SAME COMPANY. IN PARALLEL I AM LOOKING OUT FOR A NEW OPPORTUNITY AS WELL" ETC.... IF YOU PUT IT RIGHTLY WITH PURITY OF INTENTION (WHICH IS ALSO A QUALITY OF ANGEL SEALIAH) THEY MIGHT BECOME RECEPTIVE... THEY MIGHT EVEN HELP OR SUPPORT YOU TILL YOU GET STABILITY... IT IS OK TO ASK FOR SUPPORT DEAR NHU WHEN YOU REALLY NEED IT :) When I got back to Saigon, the first day I took the motorbike PERSONAL ADVANCEMENT out, the behind tire deflated [- The behind tire represents the driving force moving forward in society. This shows that I need to renew myself, build up more motivation, and renew motivation, refresh my work to have the right and surer progress. And I'm in the process of renewing myself ALSO PAST MEMORIES/PATTERNS (BACK) RELATED TO LACK OF WILLPOWER AND MOTIVATION IN YOUR THOUGHTS BECAUSE TYRE IS FILLED WITH AIR I.E. THOUGHTS ] , and I had to change to a new one. GOOD SO YOU UPGRADED TO A NEW TYRE... SIMILARLY YOU CAN UPGRADE YOUR THOUGHTS TO NEW LEVEL BY CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ANGEL SEALIAH TO UPGRADE YOUR MOTIVATION TO ADVANCE 😇🍀 Family or parents are also a root part of my motivation to move forward in my society, so when I lacked this honesty, I also caused myself to continue to lack motivation to rise up, it also does not generate real enthusiasm at work. GOOD CONNECTION HERE... ALSO PLEASE REFER TO THE COMMENTS ABOVE After that, I started to focus more on looking for a job, but I still don't have a real job. IT IS GOOD THAT YOU STARTED THE MOVEMENT NHU, CONGRATULATIONS... CONTINUE LIKE THIS... YOU CAN ALSO APPLY FOR A MORE SIMPLE JOB THAT IS CLOSE TO THE PLACE YOU LIVE FOR THE TIME OF TRANSITION... MAYBE IT WILL NOT BE YOUR DREAM JOB, BUT AT LEAST IT CAN HELP YOU TO PAY THE BILLS... AND IN THE MEANWHILE YOU LOOK FOR A JOB THAT SUITS BETTER WITH YOUR VALUES... THIS WAY YOU REMAIN WISE IN THE MATTER, AND TAKE TIME TO REPLACE YOUR LIFE WELL... ☯️ WISHING YOU A STRONG AND BALANCED MOTIVATION TOWARDS INNER AND OUTER WORK WITH ANGELS SEALIAH AND MENADEL ANGELIC REGARDS ALEXIS

title_pdf: My adoptive mother. last case id: C0221. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 25 November 2022 Angel: 35 Chavakhiah Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello Professor , ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU I chanted Angel Chavakhiah with the intention: please help me change my relationship with my sister better. OK THIS IS A WONDERFUL INTENTION TO DISCOVER THE INNER SUPPORT, AFFINITIES IN YOUR EMOTIONAL ASPECT... I'm looking for someone to move into an empty room in my rented apartment [- a part of my intimate world, a part of my feminine polarity. The symbol shows that I am in a state of lack of receptivity and lack of inner emotion because in the apartment I am living in, all are female. Previously, that room was occupied by men, and after they moved out, we decided to rent it out to women. This shows that I am in need of increased inner receptivity ] YES WELL DISCERNED... AND AT THE SAME TIME IT IS GOOD TO BE WITH PEOPLE YOU TRUST IF THEY ARE LIVING WITH YOU IN THE SAME APARTMENT... THIS PART OF THE DREAM SUGGESTS YOUR SOUL IS INVITING YOU TO CONNECT WITH ASPECTS RELATED TO YOUR RECEPTIVITY, EMOTIONS (FEMININE) ETC... SO THE INNER ROOM WHICH WAS EARLIER EMPTY (I.E. IN A WAY YOU WERE NOT CONNECTED WITH IT AS YOU INNER HIDDEN SYMBOLS WERE NOT YET REVEALED)... IS NOW BEING SHOWN... A % OF YOU, ESSENCES AS REFLECTED BY THE SYMBOL OF MS. HANH IS NOW GETTING KNOWN TO YOU OR GETTING ACTIVATED WITHIN YOU. Ms. Hanh [- a part of my feminine polarity. She is a generous, enthusiastic, kind, responsible, hardworking, and industrious woman. She is also a person who is too responsible, too gentle, sacrifices too much, tends to please everyone, worries about her children too much, emotional dependency on her children. In the reality, I don't really close to her and know much about her I.E. A PART OF YOU WHICH CAN SOMETIMES CAN GET TOO MUCH IN THE ENERGY OF PLEASING, IMPRESSING OTHERS, BEING TOO GENTLE AND GOING OUT OF THE WAY FOR OTHERS ETC.... THIS IS DUE TO MEMORIES OF LACK OF LOVE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT...SOMETIMES THE HELPING AND CARING NATURE IN YOU CAN GET A BIT MIXED UP OWING TO THESE INNER LACKS ] moved in. Everyone works all day, so we rarely meet each other. A VERY SUBTLE EXPRESSION IN THE DREAM TELLING YOU THAT SOMETIMES DUE TO EXCESSIVE FOCUS ON WORK/MATTER YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO CONNECT AND TRANSFORM THE MINUS OF YOUR INNER MS. HANH One evening, I saw Hanh return, and I found her tired. I asked her: I see you seem busy or sad these days. THIS IS A GOOD IMPROVEMENT IN YOUR EMPATHY AND RECEPTIVITY DEAR NHU... YOUR INNER MS. HANH NEEDED HELP WHICH YOU COULD FEEL AND TOOK THE RIGHT STEPS TO CONNECT AND TEND TO THIS PART OF YOU INSTED OF IGNORING OR SUPPRESSING IT ... HOWEVER, ANOTHER THING TO NOTE IS THAT EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS TIRED AND SAD, SHE DID NOT COME TO YOU HERSELF FOR SHARING, HELP, COMFORT, GUIDANCE ETC.... THIS MEANS SOMETIMES YOU CAN ALSO HESITATE TAKING HELP FROM OTHERS WHEN NEEDED LEADING TO SUPPRESSIONS... Suddenly she came to hug [- represents protection and refuge. She THIS PART OF YOU is in need of WARMTH, POSITIVE AFFINITIES, SUPPORT, protection, and refuge from those around her, showing her lack of inner faith, lack of ability to protect herself, lack of inner love BUT IT IS ALSO OK DEAR NHU TO SEEK HELP AND SUPPORT WHEN ONE IS IN GRIEF AND HELPLESSNESS ] me, put her head on my shoulder IN A WAY THIS PART OF YOU IS LOOKING FOR SUPPORT AND NEEDS HELP IN TAKING RIGHT RESPONSIBILITY TO BALANCE AND EASE YOUR SAD, NEGATIVE AND DISTURBING THOUGHTS and she said: I am very sad these days because my mother [- a part of my feminine polarity. Her mother is also my adoptive mother in real life OK, HOWEVER WE SHALL DECODE THIS AS MOTHER SYMBOL I.E. YOUR FEMININE POLARITIES, NOTIONS OF MEMORIES OF ORIGIN (ROOT CAUSE) RELATED TO THE ABOVE ASPECTS. I'm not too close to my adoptive mother in real life either, so I don't know much about her. She is a tolerant, gentle, diligent person who endures all hardships to raise her children, ready to support her children in everything. I find myself aloof from my relatives, I don't have much contact with them but only socialize. This shows that I have a complex of inferiority, lack of inner love. It will create an imbalance because of the compensatory mechanism, because with relatives I am not too close, so I tend to care about friends, or strangers too much to make up for the care I haven't been able to send to my loved ones YES YOU ARE GETTING INTUITIVE DEAR NHU ...SO YOU SEE BECAUSE OF MULTIPLE REASONS AND YOUR PATTERNS OF CREATING DISTANCE (AS SHOWN IN YOUR EARLIER DREAMS) YOU CAN SOMETIMES FEEL ALOOF, LACK OF SUPPORT & PROTECTION...THERE BY DIMINISHING THE QUALITIES OF INNER ADOPTIVE MOTHER - GENTLE, CARING, DILIGENT ETC... THIS DISTANCE ALSO LEADS TO MISUNDERSTANDING AND NOTIONS OF ASSUMING THINGS... ITS LIKE FOR E.G. WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT CONNECTED WITH EACH OTHER BUT GET TO KNOW ABOUT SOMETHING THROUGH OTHER PEOPLE, OR SOCIAL MEDIA ETC... THIS SOMETIMES TRIGGERS (DEPENDING ON THE CASE) - JEALOUSY, INFERIORITY, EGO ETC... FEELINGS OF NOSTALGIA, LACK OF LOVE, SUPPORT CAN ALSO GET TRIGGERED... PERHAPS ITS A CALL FOR YOU TO NOT CREATE SUCH DISTANCES ANYMORE... IT IS ALWAYS GOOD TO STAY CONNECTED, CORDIAL WITH PEOPLE WHEN NATURALLY POSSIBLE WITH BALANCE (WITHOUT ANY NEED OF DEPENDENCY ETC.) ] is sick these days. My mother is very weak, she has not been able to eat and drink much, and these days she can only eat and drink by infusion into the body. BLOCKAGES IN NOURISHMENT LEADING DRAINAGE OF ENERGY THEREBY LEADING TO NEED FOR EXTERNAL SUPPORT TO SUSTAIN WELL... THIS BLOCKAGE CAN ALSO BE RELATED TO ENERGETIC NOURISHMENT (I.E. WHEN DUE TO DISTANCES, RESISTANCE IN TAKING HELP YOU CAN SOMETIMES STOP YOURSELF FROM RECIEVING HELP, CARE AND SUPPORT FROM OTHERS)... AND IT IS BEAUTIFUL AT THE SAME TIME THAT SHE CONFESSES TO YOU AFTER YOU ASK WHAT'S GOING ON... IT SHOWS YOU ARE OPENING TO MORE EMPATHY AND RECEPTIVITY AND THAT IS A GOOD SIGN DEAR INITIATE 😇 I was also very worried when I heard that, I asked more about her mother. I asked her if she had free time to visit her mother with me that day. At first, she said she was free, but then she was busy. THIS IS AN INTERESTING ANGLE THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN IN THE DREAM... ON ONE SIDE YOUR INNER HANH IS VERY CONCERNED AND SAD FOR HER MOTHER BUT STILL SOMETIMES IT IS NOT THE PRIORITY... TENDENCY OF GETTING TOO BUSY SO AS TO ESCAPE FROM DIFFICULTIES AND NOT WANTING TO TOUCH UPON SENSITIVE ASPECTS WITH THE FEAR OF TRIGERRING NEGATIVE EMOTIONS... ITS LIKE HOW SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET ENGROSSED IN THEIR WORK AND OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES SO AS TO AVOID FACING DEEP EMOTIONAL TROUBLES...SO WHILE YOU ARE CONNECTING WITH YOUR EMOTIONAL ASPECTS BUT SOMETIMES THE ABOVE TENDENCY CAN ALSO LEAD TO DISTANCES AND LACK OF CONNECT... ALWAYS REMEMBER TO PRIORITIZE AND BALANCE YOUR WORK WITH FAMILY DEAR NHU... And I don't remember if I went to visit her mother. The dream shows that I have opened up my receptivity but I am still blocked because there is still a lack of inner love, proper concern for those around me, which means I am not yet caring for myself properly. I have difficulty nourishing the ability to receive, the ability to care for others (eating by infusion into the body). I exhausted myself trying to make up for this lack of love, because I made up for it in the wrong way (excessively caring, and caring for the wrong person). WONDERFUL UNDERSTANDING DEAR INITIATE The end of the dream shows that I have not visited my adoptive mother, which also means that I need to continue to improve my ability to take care of myself, and those around me more. This may stem from the fact that I am not close enough, still cold with relatives, so I have not connected deeply with them YES WELL RECEIVED BUT ALSO REMEMBER TO BE BALANCED... CONNECTING WITH RELATIVES TOO MUCH OWING TO YOUR DEPENDENCEIS CAN ALSO PROVE TO BE COUNTER PRODUCTIVE... MAINTAIN A WONDERFUL DISCERNMENT WHILE DOING SO. And this is also the answer to my intention when working with the angel Chavakhiah. YES PRIMARILY RELATED TO NOTIONS OF RESISTANCE TO TAKE HELP, DISTANCE & LACK OF CONNECT, TENDENCY TO AVOID FACING SENSITIVE EMOTIONAL ISSUES IN THE ILLUSION OF KEEPING YOURSELF BUSY.. ALSO REFER TO THE COMMENTS ABOVE AND BECAUSE YOU WERE ASKING ABOUT YOUR SISTER, AND YOU SEE MS.HANH WORRYING ABOUT HER MOTHER, IT SHOWS THERE ARE PAST MEMORIES TO SOLVE WITHIN YOU FIRST (MOTHER = ORIGIN OF FEMININE POLARITY)... WHERE YOU COULD HAVE BEEN TOO KIND, GENTLE WITH YOUR SISTER FOR EXAMPLE... VERSUS BEING TOO SELF-CENTERED AND NOT WANTING TO CONNECT WITH HER BECAUSE OF YOUR RESONANCE... NEXT TIME YOU CAN DESCRIBE IN MORE DEPTH THE RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR SISTER, TRYING TO SEE WHAT CAUSED YOU TO HAVE DIFFICULTIES TO CONNECT... SO AS TO START THE MOVEMENT OF RECONCILIATION WITHIN YOU FIRST... 🌟 GOOD OVERALL DECODING AND SUMMARY DEAR NHU... WELL DONE ... UNIVERSE HAS PROVIDED YOU A WONDERFUL GUIDANCE IN TERMS OF ASPECTS THAT YOU CAN WORK ON TOWARDS BULDING AN ANGELIC RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR SISTER. HOWEVER DO IT WITH BALANCE AND DISCERNMENT WHILE DECODING YOUR RESONANCES... WISHING YOU ANGELIC TRANSFORMATIONS WITH ANGELS CHAVAKHIAH AND UMABEL 19/08/2025, 21:47 My adoptive mother | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/104505 2/3 ANGELIC REGARDS ALEXIS

title_pdf: Lunch in the motorcycle trunk. last case id: C0222. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 2 December 2022 Angel: 35 Chavakhiah Dream mood: surprised Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello Professor ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU, I continue to chant Angel Chavakhiah with the intention: please help me improve my relationship with my sister. OK... Dream: I was at the parking lot [- represents a pause, a rest in moving forward in society. The minus is the difficulty in stopping to rest in the process of progressing in society or the lack of rest or too much rest; blocked when going forward; lack of protection and nurturing motivation to move forward; the intention to move forward in society is not pure ] GOOD UNDERSTANDING... PARKING ALSO REFLECTS NOTIONS OF MAKING GOOD USE OF WAITING PERIODS I.E. THINKING AND INTROSPECTING ABOUT THE WAY GOING FORWARD... YOUR DREAM STARTS AT THE PARKING LOT...I.E. YOU ARE CONNECTING WITH MEMORIES RELATED TO HOW YOU THINK, INTEND OR PLAN YOUR NEXT STEPS RELATED TO ADVANCEMENT... YOU ENTER THE PARKING SPACE AFTER THE CLASS... WHICH FURTHER MEANS % RELATED TO BLOCKS THAT CAN SOMETIMES DIMINISH YOUR CAPACITY TO APPLY KNOWLEDGE WHILE PLANNING THE NEXT STEPS IN TERMS OF THE WAY YOU ADVANCE to get my motorcycle [- the way I move forward in society on the individual level ] home after the class is finished. ALSO YOU ARE WANTING TO MOVE TOWARDS YOUR INTIMACY, INNER STRUCTURE (HOME) I.E. IN A WAY TRYING TO CONNECT BACK TO YOUR INNER SELF AFTER RECIEVING KNOWLEDGE (CLASS)... BUT SOMETHING CREATES AN INTERFERENCE THEREBY CAUSING AN OBSTRUCTION... LET US UNDERSTAND THAT TOGETHER IN THE NEXT PART OF THE DREAM... The opening dream shows that I am having difficulty moving forward in society, in my work, and maybe I have rested too much or have not taken enough rest to correct myself, to have a pure intention to keep moving forward (I'm still looking for a job). I also have a rejection of support when I search the job. YES... YOU CAN READ THIS ALSO ALONG WITH THE POINTS MENTIONED ABOVE I cooked lunch but didn't eat it [- cooking my own lunch represents my ability to feed myself with the energy within. But I don't eat it means I'm still feeding myself with too much external energy, maybe at a certain %, I have problems depending on external energy, lack of ability to create energy and nourish myself ] , YES.. YOU ARE CONNECTING WELL WITH THIS ... SO IN ESSENCE IT MEANS YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL CAPACITY TO MANIFEST AND NOURISH YOURSELF BUT CURRENTLY THIS IS NOT HAPPENING BECAUSE OF A NEGATIVE TENDENCY IN YOU RELATED TO NOT BEING ABLE TO ORGANIZE AND USING YOUR RESOURCES WELL, LACK OF DISCIPLINE THEREBY CAUSING WASTAGE OR DRAINAGE OF ENERGY...ITS LIKE HOW SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE HAVE RESOURCES, THEY CAN SOMETIMES TAKE IT FOR GRANTED AND NOT USE THEM WELL... YOU COOKED (I.E. PLANNED AND UTILIZED YOUR RESOURCES) BUT DID NOT EAT (WRONG NOURISHMENT, WASTAGE ETC.)... SOMETHING FOR YOU TO INTROSPECT DEAR NHU... AND FOOD IS ALSO RELATED TO HOW WE NOURISH OURSELVES METAPHYSICALLY... AND WHAT NOURISHES THE SOUL IS THE COMPLIMENTS WE GIVE TO OURSELVES ON OUR PATH... SO THIS SHOWS THAT SOMETIMES YOU DON'T ENCOURAGE YOURSELF IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL ADVANCEMENT WHEN YOU HAVE LEARNT SOMETHING NEW AT TIMES... BUT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT IF WE WANT TO KEEP THE MOTIVATION TO MOVE FORWARD 😇 so I left my lunch in the motorcycle trunk [- represents the ability to receive tools and support methods to advance in the social level. The minus point is lack of receiving support from the outside, refusing the support, high ego, too opened ] .ITS LIKE A HIDDEN COMPARTMENT... I.E. MEMORIES RELATED TO WASTAGE OF RESOURCES ARE STORED IN YOUR SUB-CONSCIOUS... THIS ALSO INFLUENCES THE WAY YOU ADVANCE IN THIS LIFE. When I opened the motorcycle trunk, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LIFT THE VEIL... OR TRY TO ACCESS THE SUB-CONSCIOUS MEMORIES RELATED TO WASTAGE, WRONG NOURISHMENT ETC....LET US EXPLORE FURTHER... many small insects like ants [- represent material needs, live instinctively too much, act instinctively in the direction of detail. The minus point is too many material needs, dependent on material needs, dependent on the swarm (the outside world), denying the masculine polarity and letting the feminine polarity dominate too much (because ants are mostly female ants, male ants have a very short cycle life and serve the sole purpose of helping queens reproduce); overprotective (ants are very protective of their nests) ] were rushing in. WELL UNDERSTOOD DEAR NHU... SO YOU SEE THERE ARE MANY MEMORIES OF BEING TOO MUCH IN MATTER DRIVEN BY NEEDS, INSTINCTUAL ASPECTS, INSECURITY, LACK OF DISCERNMENT ETC...ALSO NOTION OF SMALL MEANS TRACES OF INFERIORITY COMPLEX CAUSED DUE TO INNER LACKS OR NEEDS...THIS % MEANS THAT SOMETIMES THE TENDENCY TO FEEL INFERIOR CAN MAKE YOU WORK TOO MUCH SO AS TO COMPENSATE (LIKE THE MINUS OF AN ANT)...EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE A CAPACITY TO WORK HARD BUT IT IS NOT IN TERMS OF QUALITIES BUT MORE DRIVEN BY MATERIALISTIC PHILOSOPHY AND NEEDS AT TIMES... AND ANTS ARE WORKING A LOT BUT IN A WAY THAT IS VERY HARSH... THEY LIVE IN A SOCIETY THAT IS DOMINATED BY A TOTALITARIAN HIERARCHY, WITH THE QUEEN ON THE TOP AND EVERYONE WORKING FOR THEM... SO THIS SHOWS HOW HARSH YOU COULD BE WITH YOURSELF AT TIMES... AND THIS IS WHY THEY EAT YOUR FOOD HERE... SOMETIMES THIS % OF "ANT" ENERGY PREVENTS YOU TO GIVE YOURSELF GOOD COMPLIMENTS, GOOD FOOD FOR YOUR SOUL... I got goosebumps when I see them. I thought of throwing away the dishes, so I left the trunk open, letting them out. There is a duality here as I both nurture the ability to move forward with overly materialistic needs, but at the same time, I also deny it (when I give up eating food eaten by insects). I have not yet accepted the intention or energy that helps me on work. YES...GOOD DECODING HERE ...SO THE UNCONSCIOUS RESISTANCE TO ACCEPT THESE MULTIPLE PARTS OF YOU CREATE THE GOOSEBUMPS AND ALSO TRIGGER A TENDENCY TO ESCAPE BY REJECTING (THROWING AWAY)...YOU COULD HAVE ALSO FELT LIKE PUTTING IT IN DUSTBIN OR DISPOSING IT AWAY ETC... BUT THE PHRASE 'THROWING AWAY' BRINGS IN AN ESSENCE OF REJECTION OF THESE PARTS OF YOU...ANOTHER SUBTLE BUT IMPORTANT ASPECT FOR YOU TO NOTE IS THAT NOW YOUR INNER ANTS/INSECTS (THAT WERE IN SUB CONSCIOUS) ARE COMING OUT... SO WATCH YOUR ENERGY IN NEAR FUTURE...IN TERMS OF HOW YOU FEEL/ACT...YOU MAY EXPERIENCE SMALL SMALL MATERIAL INSECURITIES, LACKS, NEEDS GETTING TRIGGERED AND MULTIPLIED IN YOU...THESE ARE NOT YET TRANSFORMED BUT BY LETTING THEM OUT FROM THE TRUNK, YOU ARE SLOWLY LEARNING TO IDENTIFY AND ACCEPT THEM ... THIS IS A GOOD FIRST STEP BUT KEEP CHANTING TO CLEANSE THESE ASPECTS AND ALSO LEARN TO DISCERN WELL WHEN YOUR INNER INSECTS MANIFEST IN CONCRETE REALITY... WHILE NOT FORGETTING TO ENCOURAGE YOURSELF FOR THE BEAUTIFUL INNER WORK YOU ARE DOING FOR THE MOMENT :) Everyone [- outside world, outside support, outside energy ] saw and gradually focused on watching. A female teacher [- a part of my feminine polarity, belonging to the unconscious, represents my inner guidance. She has the virtues of gentleness, openness, tolerance, unconditional love, high professional knowledge, and wisdom. Her minus point is sometimes too easygoing, too open, too gentle, and lacks rigidity RIGOR, AFFIRMATION, DISCIPLINE in certain cases ] came to see. She took a small piece of food that had fewer insects assembled [- the energy that nourishes me is not pure and I still agree to receive such energy, even actively taking it ] and ate it. THIS IS ONE OF THE KEY ASPECTS SHOWN IN THIS DREAM...YOUR UNCONSCIOUS INNER WORLD OF WISDOM DID NOT DISCERN WELL HERE...SOMETIMES IN A PERCENTAGE YOUR EMOTIONS CAN BE A BIT LIKE THIS TEACHER I.E. FEELING OF WISDOM, BALANCE ETC. BUT ESSENTIALLY IT IS A FACADE OR AN ILLUSION ... THIS CAN CAUSE CONFUSIONS IN YOU AND SOMETIMES YOUR ACTIONS CAN BE DRIVEN BY THESE ILLUSORY EMOTIONS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY RIGHT... EATING INSECTS ALONG WITH FOOD DEPICTS NOTIONS OF EXCESSIVE DEPENDENCY ON NEEDS TO NOURISH YOURSELF... AND THIS SHOWS YOUR INNER TEACHER IS NOUISHING TOO MUCH FROM THE "ANT" ENERGY... AS IF YOUR INNER LEARNING, YOU HAVE PROGRAMMED TOO MUCH THAT YOU HAD TO BE HARSH WITH YOURSELF AND DOMINATE YOUR NEGATIVITY TO FEEL NOURISHED / HAVE ENERGY TO ADVANCE... AS IF IT WAS YOUR "FUEL" SOMETIMES TO BE HARSH WITH YOURSELF... WHICH IS NOT IDEAL OF COURSE... FOR E.G. LET'S SAY IN YOUR OFFICE YOU ARE GIVEN A PROJECT TO MANAGE. INSTEAD OF BEING BALANCED, FOCUSSING ON DEVELOPING QUALITIES AND LEARNINGS; YOU CAN SOMETIMES BE IN THE ENERGY TO EXCESSIVE PASSION, TRYING TO MAKE THAT PROJECT A SUCCESS, EXCESSIVE HARD WORK, EXCESSIVE MOTIVATION ETC. NOT TO DEVELOP QUALITIES BUT MORE BY THE NOTION OF NOURISHING YOUR NEEDS TO HAVE SUCCESS, PROVE THAT YOU ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS ETC... AS A SYMBOLIC STUDENT NOW YOU ARE AWARE THAT SUCH NOURISHMENT IS NOT RIGHT DEAR NHU, AND THIS DREAM HELPS YOU TO CHANGE THIS % WITHIN YOU NOW 😇♻️ I have a certain % energy of self-observation and self-evaluation (everyone gathers around) that haven't gotten proper help for my own problems, superficiality complex. At the same time, I also occasionally feed myself with bad material energies that can be in the name of education. YES.. 19/08/2025, 21:47 Lunch in the motorcycle trunk | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/104682 2/4 AND ALSO CONNECT WITH THE SHARING ABOVE I was surprised and said quickly to her: Miss, don't eat. And I wondered: why does she eat them while the insects are flocking like that? GOOD... SO YOU ARE ABLE TO SEE THE DUALITY IN YOUR INNER TEACHER AND QUESTIONING IT... A VERY IMPORTANT STEP 🌟 After trying the food, she complimented me on cooking well. Then she said: I hope you will soon discover your inner potential.YOUR SYMBOL OF KNOWLEDGE IN A % CAN SOMETIMES BE MORE IN THE ENERGY OF WANTING TO IMPRESS AND PLEASE OTHERS I was surprised and said to the friend [- a part of my feminine polarity, belonging to the unconscious, represents my inner support ] standing next to me: does she understand symbolic language, doesn't she? AN ESSENCE IN YOU WHICH CAN SOMETIMES DOUBT YOUR OWN CAPACITY TO DISCERN WELL (INFERIORITY % AS DEPICTED BY THE ANT SYMBOL) THROUGH SYMBOLIC LANGUAGE...INSTEAD YOU CAN GET TOO IMPRESSED EASILY BY SUPERFICIAL ASPECTS LIKE IN THIS CASE YOUR INNER TEACHER'S OVER CONFIDENCE... HER ACT OF EATING WRONGLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT BY YOUR INNER SPIRITUAL RADAR NOT TO JUDGE BUT TO BE ABLE TO SEE THROUGH THE COVER OF ILLUSORY WISDOM This part shows that I have the potential to nourish myself with good energy, and that I lack self-belief (I asked the friend). Here there are 3 women, showing that I am too open to receive material energy, bad energy too easily, and lacking structure to build myself (Angel 3 - Sitael). And I did not understand the symbolic language knowledge deeply enough, so I confused the teacher's sentence (shown in the following paragraph). YOU ARE BEGINNING TO CONNECT WITH THE GIST WELL DEAR NHU.. WONDERFUL INTUITION The friend was also surprised and looked at me, maybe she didn't understand. Then the teacher turned away, I said to her: can you explain more, but maybe she didn't hear. After a while, when the insects were almost gone and everyone left, suddenly the teacher came back and explained to me her sentence. However, it seems like she didn't explain in symbolic language. SO WHEN THE MATERIAL NEEDS (INSECTS) WERE GONE THEN YOU WERE ABLE TO DECIPHER THAT WHAT YOUR INNER TEACHER WAS SAYING AND DOING IS NOT RIGHT SYMBOLICALLY... YOU CAN SEE THESE ASPECTS IN RELATION WITH YOUR INTENTION AS WELL (RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR SISTER)...PERCENTAGES AS REVEALED ABOVE I.E. BLOCK WITH RESPECT TO HOW TO PLAN YOUR ADVANCEMENT, WASTAGE OF RESOURCES (ENERGETICALLY AS WELL), DEPENDENCY AND FOCUS ON OWN NEEDS TO NOURISH YOURSELF, DIFFICULTY TO HAVE RIGHT DISCIPLINE, TENDENCY TO IMPRESS/PLEASE OR GET EASILY IMPRESSED/PLEASED BY OTHERS ETC... CAN CREATE BLOCKAGES IN THE WAY YOU CONNECT WITH YOUR INNER SISTER AND ALSO THE TENDENCY TO BE TOO HARSH AND FORGET TO GIVE COMPLIMENTS... IT IS SO IMPORTANT IN A RELATIONSHIP... INSTEAD OF CRITICIZING / DOMINATING THE OTHER PERSON... AND IF IT IS HER WHO DOMINATES YOU, YOU SHOULD ALSO LEARN TO AFFIRM YOURSELF WELL, NOT LETTING YOURSELF BEING "EATEN" BY THE OTHER PERSON... WHILE REMAINING GENTLE, WE SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO SET THE RIGHT LIMITS... I also have delays and have not really received in the process of learning and deepening knowledge (the teacher returned after a while). Therefore, I don't have a deep knowledge of the symbolic language. This week, while working with the Angel Chavakhiah, I had days of cravings for meat and seafood. And when I eat them, I feel that they taste very bad, not as good as I thought. The bad taste comes from the food and from my experience, the seafood is not fresh and the meat is smelly. They make my stomach scratch. This could be a signal that the universe is telling me that I am feeding myself with the wrong energies, and inside I am slowly recognizing and not receiving them, they are making me unwell (the message is sent to me through dreams and real life). YES WE UNDERSTAND DEAR NHU... WE ADMIRE YOUR HONESTY ...SOMETIMES THE POWER OF MEMORIES CAN BECOME TOO INTENSE. DUE TO THIS EVEN AFTER HAVING THE WISDOM ONE IS NOT ABLE TO STOP HIMSELF. AT TIMES THIS UNDERSTANDING IS MORE INTELLECTUAL AND HAS STILL NOT BEEN INTEGRATED WELL AT EMOTIONAL AND ACTION LEVEL. IT IS ABSOLUTELY OK TO RESPECT YOUR RHYTHM AND NOT BECOME TOO HARSH OR RIGID IF AT TIMES A SLIPPAGE HAPPENS ...YOU HAVE CONNECTED THE DOTS WELL WITH THE DREAM AS EVEN HERE THERE IS AN ANGLE OF WRONG NOURISHMENT... AND NOW YOUR BODY IS EVEN GIVING YOU CONCRETE SIGNS THAT IT IS NOT THE IDEAL FOOD... YOU ARE WELL GUIDED... :) And this week I feel frustrated again and continue to go to another coastal city to change the atmosphere. I found myself indulging myself too much, inside I was hasty, rebellious, acting on emotions too much without having the wisdom to look at the current situation. OK...AS WE SHARED WITH YOU EARLIER... WHILE IT IS OK TO PLAN AN INTERMISSION TO RECHARGE YOURSELF...BUT DOING IT TOO MUCH CAN BE AN ESCAPISM...JUST LIKE IN THE DREAM 'THROWING AWAY' THE FOOD... DO NOT REJECT THESE ASPECTS AND WORK ON THEM BY LEARNING TO RESPECT YOUR RESOURCES AND USE THEM WELL... EVEN ENRGETICALLY YOU CAN INTROSPECT WHETHER GOING FOR A VACATION BECAUSE YOU ARE FURSTRATED IS A GOOD USE OF ENERGY OR SHOULD YOU BE FOCUSSING YOUR ENERGY TOWARDS GETTING PROFESSIONAL STABILITY. I know that universe is being harsher on me to take lessons at work, to educate me about my character, and to test me for bad energies within. UNIVERSE IS NEVER HARSH DEAR NHU... YES, IT CAN BE RIGOROUS, BUT NOT HARSH... :) IT IS MORE YOURSELF WHO IS HARSH WITH YOU... ON THE CONTRARY IT KEEPS GIVING US SECOND CHANCES, WISDOM, GUIDANCE AND ALSO PROTECTION. HOWEVER, UNIVERSE DOES NOT INTERFERE IN YOUR AUTONOMY AND LETS YOU DECIDE...YOUR THOUGHTS, EMOTIONS, ACTIONS CREATE MEMORIES/KARMA AND THEN CIRCLE OF LIVING THROUGH CONSEQUENCES STARTS...WE CAN ALWAYS WORK ON OUR MEMORIES AND DISSOLVE SUCH 19/08/2025, 21:47 Lunch in the motorcycle trunk | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/104682 3/4 KARMIC BLOCKAGE... FOR E.G. THROUGH DSSI AND UCM PATH, UNIVERSE GAVE YOU WISDOM, GUIDANCE, POSSIBILITY TO LEARN SO THAT YOU CAN BECOME A BETTER PERSON...BUT WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE, WILL YOU APPLY THE WISDOM, GUIDANCE ETC. THAT IS YOUR OWN AUTONOMY/DECISION...AND YOUR DECISIONS/ACTIONS TODAY DEFINE YOUR LIFE TOMORROW... JUST LIKE A PARENT UNIVERSE KEEPS PROVIDING US SUPPORT WITH A LOT OF LOVE BUT ALSO LETS US LEARN FROM OUR OWN EXPERIMENTS ... I need more rigidity RIGOR, STRUCTURE, ORGANIZING WELL and more discipline to transform and change myself .. AND DO NOT FORGET THE COMPLIMENTS DEAR INITIATES... WHEN YOU DO THINGS WELL, THIS ALWAYS DESERVE A COMPLIMENT... EVEN IF IT IS NOT PERFECT... YOU CAN REMIND THE RATIO TO GIVE YOURSELF AT LEAST 8 COMPLIMENTS FOR 2 CONSTRUCTIVE REMARKS... IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE JOY AND MOTIVATION TO EVOLVE... And this is my last dream in my 2nd year. I am grateful to Alexis and Darpan for always accompanying and helping me throughout the school year. IT HAS BEEN A LOT OF JOY TO ACCOMPANY YOU IN YOUR JOURNEY OF SELF-DISCOVERY DEAR NHU... WE ARE VERY PROUD OF YOU AND OF YOUR EFFORTS ON THIS JOURNEY... AND WE KNOW IT IS NOT EASY TO BE AN INITIATE... AND THIS IS WHY WE NEED TO GIVE OURSELVES SECOND CHANCES, ENCOURAGEMENTS REGULARLY... JUST LIKE WITH YOUR SISTER... WHEN WE TRY TO REPAIR A RELATIONSHIP IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY IF WE HAVE BEEN HURT IN THE PAST... BUT IF WE KEEP A RIGHT INTENTION, IF WE CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE OUR EFFORTS AND REMAIN SINCERE IN OUR WISH, THEN ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN... THE OTHER PERSON'S SOUL CAN FEEL IT AND ALSO OPEN TO CHANGE... OF COURSE WE SHOULD NOT FORCE ANYTHING, BUT ONE STEP AT A TIME, WE CAN REBUILD WHAT HAS BEEN BROKEN... REMINDING THAT THE RESONANCE IS FIRST WITHIN US... 🌟 WISHING YOU A BEAUTIFUL CONTINUITY Wish you all a beautiful evolution with symbolic language ... THANK YOU DEAR NHU...WE WISH THE SAME FOR YOU AS WELL ! Angelic thank you ANGELIC DISCERNMENT AND LEARNING TO USE YOUR RESOURCES WELL AND GIVE YOURSELF THE RIGHT ENCOURAGEMENT WITH ANGELS PAHALIAH AND ELEMIAH ANGELIC REGARDS ALEXIS

title_pdf: A couple of female ghosts. last case id: C0223. PDF text: Dream date: Thursday, 17 March 2022 Angel: 39 Rehael Dream mood: scare, surprise, excited Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello teachers ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU I and many people came to a house with many rooms to live and study [- my inner structure with the ability to nourish and study to develop at the social level. Minus points are difficult to nourish me, difficult to understand the knowledge, problems organizing events, or personal encounters WELL UNDERSTOOD HERE YOU ARE CONNECTING WITH MEMORIES RELATED TO YOUR CAPACITY TO LEARN, RECEIVE AND APPLY KNOWLEDGE. ALSO INDICATES THE SOCIAL DIMENSION OF YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS IN RELATION TO LEARNING (AS THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE) ] . The house is in the suburbs [- tendency to hermit life, lack of reality, tendency to flee or escape SO IN A WAY IT MEANS THAT A PART OF YOU HAS A TENDENCY TO CONSIDER KNOWLEDGE AS ISOLATED FROM ACTION, MATTER (CITY LIFE)... OWING TO THIS SOMETIMES YOU CAN FACE DIFFICULTIES TO APPLY KNOWLEDGE IN YOUR CONCRETE LIFE... INITALLY THE WISDOM IS MORE AT A INTELLECTUAL LEVEL AND WITH CONTINUOUS SELF-WORK YOU WILL EVENTUALLY BE ABLE TO APPLY IT BETTER IN YOUR DAILY LIFE ] , surrounded by many trees [- emotion world. Minus points are too emotional, emotional dependence, insensitivity ALSO ON THE MINUS, A TREE REMAINS ROOTED TO ONE PLACE HAVING DIFFICULTY TO ADVANCE... YOU CAN READ IT AS AN EXTENSION TO THE EXPLANATION PROVIDED ABOVE (SUBURBS) ] . There are a lot of people here that I don't know MULTIPLE PARTS OF YOU WHICH ARE HIDDEN/UNCONSCIOUS WHEN IT COMES TO NOTIONS OF LEARNING. I lack ability to nourish and develop at the social level because of the tendency to hermit life, emotional dependence YES... BUT WHAT IS INTERESTING HERE IS THAT YOU ARE IN A HERMIT MODE, BUT ALSO WITH MANY PEOPLE... A LITTLE LIKE THE MONKS IN A MONASTERY... THEY ARE MORE SOCIAL THAT WE THINK SOMETIMES... :) IT SHOWS THAT YOU COULD DEPEND ON OTHERS, ON THE SOCIAL ENERGY TOO MUCH TO MOTIVATE YOU TO STUDY, DEVELOP KNOWLEDGE IN YOU... BECAUSE EVENTUALLY, IF YOU HAD NOT THIS SOCIAL MOTIVATION, YOU COULD LET YOURSELF GO IN MORE ORDINARY ENERGIES... BUT BECAUSE OF THAT YOU COULD EVENTUALLY LET YOURSELF BE INFLUENCED BY OTHERS TOO MUCH SOMETIMES... POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY... ALSO PLEASE REFER TO THE COMMENTS ABOVE In the morning [- represents our consciousness, the world of action YES, ALSO SOME ASPECTS WHICH HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT (MORNING) IN THIS DREAM ] , I went to the common room [- inner structure related at the collective level WHICH ALSO CONNECTS WITH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A PART OF YOU INTERACTS OR CONNECTS WITH OTHERS (SOCIAL ASPECT)... ] and met a sister [- a part of my feminine polarity A % OF THE WAY YOU ARE IN YOUR WORLD OF EMOTIONS belongs to the unconscious. Minus points EMOTIONS WHICH CAN SOMETIMES BE are cold, insecurities inside ] . I asked her about her job and knew she was working as an accountant [- a lack or excess of rigor in the management of resources, greed, thinking only of profit, tendency to focus on results WELL DISCERNED, ALSO DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING THE PLUS AND MINUS (SYMBOLICALLY), BLOCKAGES IN GIVING AND RECIEVING ] . She moved out to live with her husband. I am very excited to ask her if she is looking for a job [- job represents learning and advancement in society. "look for" symbol represents an inner lack, so we tend to seek the outer to make up OK BUT IT FEELS AS IF YOU WERE A BIT TOO EXCITED OR FORCED YOUR LINE OF THOUGHT ON SOMEONE. PERHAPS YOU COULD HAVE WAITED AND RESPECTED THE NATURAL FLOW IN THE WAY YOU CONNECTED WITH HER SO AS TO KNOW WHETHER SHE IS IN NEED FOR A JOB OR NOT... UCM VIETNAM IS ALSO A SYMBOL OF SPIRITUAL WISDOM... SO YOU SEE SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE TOO EXCITED TO TALK ABOUT KNOWLEDGE/WISDOM WITHOUT RESPECTING THE NATURAL FLOW AND PACE OF EVOLUTION OF OTHERS... AND WANT TO INFLUENCE OTHERS TOO MUCH... BECAUSE YOU ARE TOO INFLUENCED BY OTHERS YOURSELF SOMETIMES, TO BE MOTIVATED... YOU CAN SOMETIMES BE A BIT LIKE THIS TO YOURSELF AS WELL DEAR NHU... AS A STUDENT ONE'S PRIMARY GOAL SHOULD BE TO FIRST APPLY THE KNOWLEDGE ON SELF... ANOTHER ANGLE TO LOOK AT IS THAT SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE IN THE ENERGY OF HELPING OTHERS A BIT TOO MUCH (EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE NOT ASKED FOR IT), THIS CAN MAKE YOU APPEAR INTRUSIVE DEAR NHU... WHILE IT IS A BEAUTIFUL QUALITY TO HELP BUT ONE SHOULD RESPECT OTHER PERSON'S OPENNESS, WILLINGNESS AND PATH OF EVOLUTION TO RECIEVE HELP. ] in accounting because I have a very attractive place (UCM Vietnam is looking for an accountant now so I would like to introduce it to her). She said she was helping her husband in a self- founded company, which was great. Then many people went to the common room. I lack the ability to manage inner resources and in work on a social level. Therefore, I tend to work independently, desire to develop independently, lack the ability to integrate with the community AND BEHIND THIS THERE COULD BE THE OPPOSITE FORCE... DEPENDING ON OTHERS TOO MUCH... BOTH ARE ALWAYS CONNECTED... Next scene, I'm in math class [- represents computational structure, building our living program. Minus points are too mechanical, too calculating, too detailed, too perfectionist LEADING TO DIFFICULTIES IN DECODING THE SYMBOLIC EQUATIONS OF LIFE ] . I remember that the teacher gave a quick lecture and I couldn't take notes [- represents the receptivity, learning ] in time. HERE ALSO THE TEACHER (ANOTHER PART OF YOU WHEN GUIDING OR HELPING OTHERS) IS QUICK WHILE GIVING THE LECTURE I.E. NOT RESPECTING YOURS AS WELL OTHERS PACE OF LEARNING AND EVOLVING THEREBY FORCING MULTIPLE PARTS OF YOU TO LEARN FAST... YOUR INNER STUDENT WAS NOT ABLE TO TAKE NOTES... THIS DYNAMIC CAN CREATE DIFFICULTIES IN YOUR CAPACITY TO LEARN AND RECIEVE MORE STRUCTURE, ORGANIZATION (MATH) IN YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM DEAR NHU... I lack the reception and learning of my own life program WELL SUMMARIZED, ALSO PLEASE REFER TO THE COMMENTS ABOVE :-) In the evening [- represents our unconsciousness ALSO DEPICTS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET IN THE INTERIORIZATION MODE (FROM ACTION), IN MOMENTS TO REFLECTION ] , people take out chairs [- represents receptivity.

Minus points are lack of practice, too theoretical or too practical ALSO BLOCKAGES IN A SMALL % TO APPLY KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM (STUDYING, PRACTICE ETC.) ] . I sit near the left end of the house [- lack of receptivity to change inner structure WELL DISCERNED AND HERE YOU PUT YOURSELF APART A LITTLE TOO MUCH... YOU SEE DIFFICULTIES TO INTEGRATE IN THE GROUP, BECAUSE BEHIND THERE COULD BE FORCES THAT WANT TO BE PART OF THE GROUP TOO MUCH ON THE CONTRARY... ] . To my right was a person, but they left, leaving the chair empty. In life, there are many times when I unconsciously lack the right receptivity and action, at the right time because I lack of knowledge and practice, learning Suddenly, I was tapped on the shoulder [- shoulder represents responsibility; tapped is a signal. Tapped on the shoulder means a signal of lack of responsibility or putting too much responsibility of society on oneself IN THIS PART OF THE DREAM YOU ARE CONNECTING WITH REASONS FOR THE PATTERNS DISCUSSED ABOVE. YOU HAVE BEEN TAPPED FROM BEHIND (REMINDER FROM THE MEMORIES OF PAST THAT ARE NOW SEEKING YOUR ATTENTION, AS ITS TIME TO WORK ON THEM AND CHANGE). AS AN INITIATE IT IS ALSO YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP EVOLVING THROUGH CONTINUOUS SELF WORK (HENCE TAPPING ON THE SHOULDER) ] to ask a question. I turned around surprised because it was a couple of female ghosts [- ghost is the negative memory inside each of us, representing oppression, repression, aggression, violence. A couple of female ghosts represent a part of my feminine polarity, representing receptivity in relationships tend to be oppressive, aggressive REPRESENTS A PART OF YOUR UNCONSIOUS NEGATIVE EMOTIONAL MEMORIES THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN TRANSFORMED ] . They asked me a question THESE UNCONSIOUS PARTS OF YOU ARE ASKING QUESTIONS THAT TOO IN A NICE POLITE WAY. THIS IS IN A WAY GOOD AS THEY WANT TO BE HELPED AND TRANSFORMED IN THE LIGHT OF KNOWLEDGE (AS YOU ARE STUDYING) and I was surprised, a little scared, so I froze. FEAR ON THE MINUS DEPICTS AN UNCONSCIOUS RESISTANCE IN YOU TO FACE AND TRASCEND THE MEMORIES AS REPRESENTED BY YOUR INNER FEMALE GHOSTS... AND BECAUSE IT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE A LITTLE APART FROM OTHERS, YOU SEE THAT THESE MEMORIES OF EXCLUSION ARE CONNECTING YOU TO PAST PATTERNS FROM YOUR INNER WORLD THAT WERE NOT TRANSFORMED... YOU CAN EVEN SEE IF YOU SUFFERED FROM EXCLUSION AT SCHOOL FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER... THIS COULD BE POSSIBLE WITH A DREAM LIKE THIS... AND THESE GHOSTS APPEAR TO HELP YOU SOLVE THESE MEMORIES IN THE RELATIONAL TODAY... 🌟 19/08/2025, 15:43 A couple of female ghosts | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/92710 2/4 Negative memories of oppression, aggression, violence have suppressed me, causing me to put many responsibilities on myself from society. It made me feel irresponsible and in need of a wake-up call. I'm afraid of the responsibilities that I create myself. They looked like normal people and asked me with a very normal attitude. It's just that there's white smoke [- White represents purification, purity, receptivity. Smoke represents the transition between two states of consciousness. White smoke means a change of state of mind, purification to become purer. Minus points are lack of knowledge to change, lack of understanding of resonance and karma SMOKE IS A STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH IS RELATED TO THE AIR ELEMENT (THOUGHTS). ON THE MINUS IT CAN CLOUD YOUR CAPACITY TO THINK CLEARLY, CREATES A DISCONNECT IN THE WAY YOU THINKS VIS-A-VIS HOW YOU FEEL (EMOTIONS). WHITE ON THE MINUS CAN DENOTE NOTIONS OF ABSTRACTNESS, ILLUSION ETC. ] behind them and their skin is white LACK OF EMOTIONS so I'm a bit scared. I answered and they smiled. They turned to the person next to me. A PART OF YOU (ESPECIALLY IN THE WAY YOU FEEL) WHICH CAN SOMETIMES BE TOO SCARED OR RESISTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE, ANSWER OR WORK ON THE MEMORIES RELATED TO YOUR INNER GHOSTS (PAST NEGATIVE PATTERNS OF EXCLUSION, ETC.)... THIS CAN CREATE LIMITATIONS IN YOUR CAPACITY TO LEARN AND TO APPLY KNOWLEDGE THE RIGHT WAY. Because I lack knowledge of resonance and karma, so I create fear for myself, I lack inner security. And I'm slowly learning to recognize this negative memory, so I realize it's normal (normal attitude) YOU SEE IN THE FIRST PART OF THE DREAM (MORNING = ACTION) YOU WERE TOO EXCITED BUT IN THE LATTER PART (EVENING = INTERIORIZED, WORLD WITHIN ) YOU ARE A BIT SCARED/ RESISTANT. THIS CAN LEAD TO DUALITIES, ANXIETIES AND CONFUSION IN YOU DEAR NHU The next person is Hien [- my secondary school friend, she represents a part of my feminine polarity. For me, her negative points THAT ARE IN YOU AS WELL IN TERMS OF RESONANCE (IN A %) are stubbornness, lack of inner security, lack of love, curiosity about other people's affairs too much YOU SEE, THIS IS NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT IT IS YOUR HIGH SCHOOL FRIEND... YOU CAN SEE IF YOU FELT EXCLUDED SOMETIMES WITH HER... OR WANTED TO BE PART OF THE GROUP TOO MUCH... ] . Hien smiled and answered normally, even joking with them. I was surprised: well, Hien is natural and brave. I wonder why I'm scared like that, these 2 girls are not bullying me. Hien even ran and played with those 2 THIS CAN ALSO BE RELATED TO HUMAN DISTORTIONS REPRESENTED BY ANGEL JELIEL - LACK OF LOVE & WISDOM, QUARRELS, CONFLICTS ETC. female ghosts. And they continued their work asking everyone else. HERE, THE FACT OF PLAYING WITH THE GHOSTS HERE SHOWS A FORM OF TRIVIALIZATION OF YOUR PAST MEMORIES... AS IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO ENTER TOO MUCH IN THESE MEMORIES OF EXCLUSION THAT YOU MAY HAVE LIVED AT SCHOOL... AND THE FACT THAT THEY ASKED EVERYONE SHOWS NEEDS FOR TOO MUCH ATTENTION... MECHANISMS THAT COULD EVENTUALLY HAPPENED AT SCHOOL AS WELL FOR YOU IN THE PAST, AND THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE TO STUDY... A part of me (Hien) received these memories freely, responding to them positively, showing that I was on a transformational path and that I needed to work harder when facing them directly. However, it also reminded me that I was too aggressive in the face of it, it was overdone (ran and play). So I need to rebalance. On the day I received this dream, I had a little anxiety about the plan I was about to launch for my company. I'm afraid I won't be able to deploy it due to lack of resources. However, it only lasted a few hours. Then I started going into the details of the work and estimating the resources to deploy. I was less worried and more secure. I think this dream shows me that my little anxiety comes from the responsibility that I put myself and I realize them gradually and work with them more to transform. YOUR INNER FEMALE GHOSTS LEADING TO ANXIETY OWING TO EXPECTATIONS, RECOGNITION, EXPECTATIONS ETC. FROM THE LAUNCH THAT YOU HAVE PLANNED FOR THE COMPANY... BECAUSE YOU HAVE CONNECTED WITH MEMORIES OF EXCLUSION, DEPENDING TOO MUCH ON OTHERS APPROVAL AND RECOGNITION... THIS DREAM IS WELL CONNECTED TO THAT, TO HELP YOU TRANSFORM THESE PATTERNS NOW AND BE CONFIDENT IN YOURSELF THE RIGHT WAY, NOT TO DEPEND ON OTHERS ANYMORE TO FEEL MOTIVATED :) I have a question: when I work with an Angel, should I focus on chanting and transforming a distortion that I have or should I chant and make an intention to transform all of Angel's distortions? BOTH ARE OK DEAR NHU... WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO FOLLOW YOUR INTUITION.... IF YOU WISH TO WORK ON A SPECIFIC ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE YOU CAN ADD A SPECIFIC INTENTION RELATED TO THAT...OR ELSE YOU CAN ASK THE UP-ABOVE TO SHOW YOU WHAT IS IT THAT YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO ADVANCE ON YOUR PATH OF EVOLUTION... Thank you CONGRATULATIONS FOR YOUR BEAUTIFUL ANALYSIS AND EFFORT NHU... YOU HAVE A TOUCHING HONESTY AND HUMLITY... WE WISH THAT YOUR INNER STUDENT FLOURISH AND EVOLVE IN AN ANGELIC WAY BY BEING CONSCIOUS OF APPLYING WISDOM IN ALL ASPECTS OF YOUR LIFE WITH ANGELS NELKHAEL AND JABAMIAH ANGELIC REGARDS ALEXIS

title_pdf: Purification. last case id: C0224. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 25 March 2022 Angel: 33 Yehuiah Dream mood: surprise, grateful Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello Professor ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU This week, I chanted Angel Yehuiah with the question: why do I have this resistance? I have this question because I received some tasks from my boss. And I found there is resistance inside me, not wanting to accept. Part of me feels it's absurd, it's not for me. I feel constrained and forced. I feel like my boss is just giving me every task without thinking. WE UNDERSTAND DEAR NHU, IT IS WONDERFUL THAT YOU HAVE PUT AN INTENTION TO UNDERSTAND THIS RESISTANCE IN A BETTER WAY. YOU CAN MEDITATE WHETHER YOU HAVE PATTERNS OF BEING A BIT JUDGEMENTAL WHEN IT COMES TO TYPE OF WORK... ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT ANY TASK, ACTIVITY OR PROJECT THAT YOU ARE A PART OF IS THERE TO TEACH YOU SOMETHING. IT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE, SO TRY TO BE RECEPTIVE TOWARDS RESPONSIBILITIES ENTRUSTED TO YOU AND APPLY RESONANCE WHENEVER SOMETHING BOTHERS YOU, IT WILL HELP YOU CONNECT WITH YOUR INNER BLOCKAGES IN A DEEPER WAY. IT IS ALSO YOUR INNER BOSS WHO DOES NOT THINK BEFORE PLANNING AND ALLOCATING WORK, THIS HAPPENS WHEN A PERSON APPROACHES WORK WITH A HORIZONTAL CONSCIOUSNESS (SOME TASK LIKE A CHECKLIST WHICH HAS TO BE COMPLETED WITHOUT CONNECTING WITH IT AT ANY LEVEL). YOU CAN REFLECT UPON THIS AS WELL, IN TERMS OF HOW DO YOU APPROACH YOUR WORK SOMETIMES... AND OF COURSE, IT IS NORMAL IF YOUR BOSS TRUSTS YOU THAT THEY GIVE YOU A LOT OF WORK... IT MEANS THEY KNOW THEY CAN COUNT ON YOU... :) BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DELEGATE YOUR WORK WHEN NECESSARY, OR SIMPLY ASK YOUR BOSS WHAT IS THE PRIORITY TO DO... YOU DO A LIST OF WHAT HE GAVE YOU, AND YOU ASK HIM IN WHAT ORDER IT SHOULD BE DONE, NUMBER #1, NUMBER #2, NUMBER #3, ETC... SOMETIMES A MANAGER DON'T ALWAYS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING FOR THE MOMENT, SO IT IS ALSO UP TO YOU TO COMMUNICATE WHEN NECESSARY INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING YES... AND THE MORE YOU WILL DO THIS, THE MORE YOU WILL ORGANIZE YOUR WORK BETTER 🌟 Here is my dream: I'm in a public restroom [- restroom represents purification. Public restroom means purifying on a collective level with collective energy. The minus is difficulty in purification on an individual and collective level, being influenced by the energies of others during purification, difficulty in understanding karma VERY WELL CONNECTED, SO HERE YOU ARE CONNECTING WITH YOUR SOCIAL DIMENSION (IN TERMS OF HOW YOU INTERACT OR CONNECT WITH OTHERS) AND BLOCKAGES WHICH CAN BLOCK YOUR CAPACITY TO PURIFY YOURSELF FROM NEGATIVE ASPECTS ] . I'm waiting with some other women. Someone came out from the restroom [- a part of my unconscious has been purified, I am in the process of being purified SO HERE YOU ARE BEING SHOWN THE IMPORTANCE OF WAITING AND PATIENCE, ONE CAN CREATE A LOT OF DISTURBANCE IF HE/SHE FORCES HIS/HER INNER PURIFICATION BY BEING INTENSE, HOWEVER, WHEN HE/SHE LEARNS TO WAIT AND BE ALIGNED WITH THE UNIVERSAL PLAN THEN BEAUTIFUL SYNCHRONICITIES EMERGE THAT CAN FACILITATE YOUR EVOLUTION... IT IS A GOOD THING THAT YOU WAITED FOR YOUR TURN :-) ] where I was waiting in front, then I went in. I went in for a while, then looked out the door and saw a child peeking at [- a child represents a new beginning. peek at represents curiosity. "a child peeking at" means I am curious about negative memories that need to be purified, I am trying to understand these memories to have a new start IT ALSO REPRESENTS A PART OF YOU WHICH IS STILL NAIVE AND HAS NOT MATURED ENOUGH. IT IS NOT RIGHT TO PEEK WHEN SOMEONE IS USING THE RESTROOM I.E. ASPECTS OF BEING INVASIVE IN SOMEONE ELSE'S INTIMACY...OR LET OTHERS INVADE YOUR INTIMACY... THIS PART OF YOU HAS NOT BEEN TRAINED AND HENCE HAS NOT YET LEARNT THIS LESSON... IT REPRESENTS A PERCENTAGE OF YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES WHICH IF NOT UNCHECKED NOW CAN BECOME MORE PROMINENT... ALSO IT DENOTES TENDENCY IN YOU TO BE TOO MUCH INTERESTED IN WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OTHER PEOPLE'S PERSONAL LIVES... ] me. At this time, I noticed that the room door is no longer a closed-door [- at times too open and at times too close, having difficulty transitioning to a new stage of mind ] like before, it had become a tarpaulin [- represents the protection, division between the collective and individual spaces. The minus is being too intimate with strangers on a social level, too open ] and it can be easily lifted. YES, SO YOU SEE, WHEN THIS PART OF YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS GETS ACTIVE YOU ARE SOMETIMES ARE NOT ABLE TO UNDESTAND THAT BOUNDARIES OR DEMARCATIONS HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY, THIS CAN MAKE YOU TOO CASUAL AND NOT RESPECT THEM. HENCE A DOOR HAS NOW BECOME TARPAULIN I.E. A MAKE-SHIFT SEGREGATION WHICH CAN BE EASILY VIOLATED. I have difficult in purification on an individual and collective level because maybe sometime I am too open with strangers in the social. Sometimes I am too curious about their private life also. VERY WELL DISCERNED DEAR NHU ... WHILE INTERACTING WITH MULTIPLE PARTS OF YOU (SOCIETY ETC.) YOU CAN UNCONSCIOUSLY ENTER IN OTHER PEOPLE'S OR LET OTHERS ENTER YOUR INTIMACY. ANOTHER ANGLE TO UNDERSTAND THIS DEEPLY IS THAT CHILD ON THE MINUS CAN ALSO REPRESENT ASPECTS RELATED TO LACK OF LOVE & ATTENTION... BECAUSE OF THIS IT CAN SOMETIMES MAKE YOU ENTER OR LET OTHERS ENTER THE PERSONAL SPACE IN ORDER TO SEEK LOVE AND ATTENTION DEAR NHU... WE INVITE YOU MEDITATE ON THIS But then I was not too surprised, I still calmly asked the baby: what are you doing? BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISED AS PEEKING IS NOT NORMAL AND NOT A RIGHT THING TO DO ... WHILE IT IS GOOD TO BE CALM BUT ON THE MINUS YOU ARE INDIRECTLY ENCOURAGING YOUR INNER CHILD TO DO THIS ACT IF YOU DON'T REACT ENOUGH = LETTING OTHERS INVADE YOUR INTIMACY TOO MUCH SOMETIMES...SINCE IT IS A CHILD IT CAN BE A REFLECTION OF NAIVETY OR IMMATURITY Then the baby laughed lightly YES... FEELING ENCOURAGED IN A SUBTLE WAY . Then I heard people screaming [- fear, insecurity ] in some other rooms, so I found out that many children were also peeking in other rooms at the same time. Then the baby ran away. OTHER PARTS OF YOU (IN THE UNCONSCIOUS) THAT RAISED AN ALARM... SO IN A WAY IT MEANS THAT A CERTAIN % IN YOU WOULD WARN YOU OR STOP YOU FROM CROSSING THE LINE OR LETTING OTHERS CROSS THE LINE... BUT SOMEHOW YOUR MAIN SELF CAN TEND TO IGNORE OR OVERRIDE THESE WARNINGS/ALARMS... THIS HAPPENS WHEN FORCE OF MEMORIES BECOME TOO STRONG THAT IT LIMITS ONE'S CAPACITY TO DISCERN... ALSO SINCE THIS WAS A CHILD HE RAN AWAY BUT IF NOT TRANSFORMED... WHEN THIS % INCREASES AND THIS INNER CHILD BECOMES AN ADULT SYMBOLICALLY (I.E. HIGHTENED % OF SUCH MEMORIES & RESONANCE) THEN IT MAY BE TOO LATE TO CALL FOR PROTECTION/HELP... THIS DREAM IS A WONDERFUL GIFT GUIDING YOU TO TRANSFORM THIS UNCONSCIOUS ASPECT OF YOU... I was scared when I realize my own negative memories I needed to be cleansed, and at the same time I was afraid of other people realize them. Then I looked up at the wall between my room and the next room [- represents structure, protection, limitation in purification. The minus is too open, lack principles and structure on the intimate level ] and saw that there was a roll of toilet paper [- Paper represents the ability to perform ideas. Toilet paper represents realization, promoting cleansing faster. The minus is dependence, difficulty in purification ] and a clothes hanger [- represents tidiness, grooming outside. The minus is difficulty in expressing outside, inconsistency between inside and outside ALSO INDICATING HOW THE ABOVE ASPECTS ARE RELATED WITH YOUR SOCIAL AURA (I.E. THE WAY OTHERS PERCIEVE YOU)... A 'CLOTHES HANGER' HELPS IN ENSURING THAT THE CLOTHES REMAIN IN GOOD CONDITION BUT IF ONE REMAINS CASUAL THEN HIS/HER SOCIAL AURA CAN GET NEGATIVELY IMPACTED ] already for me because my room ran out of toilet paper. At this moment, I suddenly feel very grateful. I guess maybe the previous person used this room, brought it and left it there quietly. SO IN A WAY YOU ARE BEING PROTECTED AND GUIDED TO ENABLE YOU TO ACHIEVE YOUR POTENTIAL OF EXPERIENCING A COMPLETION OF A CYCLE OF YOUR INNER PURIFICATION ... BUT THIS CAN HAPPEN ONLY WHEN YOU ARE RECEPTIVE AND IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE KNOWLEDGE 19/08/2025, 15:44 Purification | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/93300 2/4 AND LEARNINGS OF SYMBOLIC LANGUAGE & STUDY OF ANGELS; WHICH WE CAN SEE YOU ARE ALREADY WORKING TOWARDS BEAUTIFULLY DEAR NHU ... IT IS A GOOD QUALITY TO BE HUMBLE AND BE GRATEFUL... THIS WILL MAKE YOU MORE OPEN TO RECIEVE GUIDANCE TOWARDS CLEANSING AND TRANSFORMING THE NEGATIVE MEMORIES THAT CREATE DIFFICULTIES IN YOUR CAPACITY TO PURIFY... I have the ability to continue the purification process and there are outside available resources to support me. YES, IT IS SHOWING YOUR POTENTIAL WHICH CAN BECOME A REALITY WHEN THE INNER CHILD TENDENCY HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED... As I realized the answer for my question: this dream showed me that I had insecurity, difficulty understanding resonance, karma so I have resistance when received tasks assigned by my boss. YOU CAN WATCH YOUR ENERGY DURING YOUR INTERACTION WITH YOUR BOSS... JUST TO KEEP IN CHECK WHAT SIGNALS / ENERGY FROM YOU THAT YOUR BOSS MAY BE PERCEVING UNCONSCIOUSLY OR UNKNOWINGLY, ... BECAUSE ON YOUR SIDE, IF YOU ACCEPT TOO MUCH THE WORK WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING, IT IS LIKE IF YOU LET THE OTHER PERSON COME INTO YOUR RESTROOM WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING... SO YOU LOSE YOUR CAPACITY TO INTROSPECT, TRANSFORM YOUR MEMORIES BY LEAVING THE DOOR TOO OPENED FOR OTHERS IN A WAY... OF COURSE YOU SHOULD NOT REFUSE THE WORK YOU ARE GIVEN, BUT SIMPLY TALK ABOUT IT MORE, DISCUSS ABOUT HOW TO ORGANIZE IT WELL... AND IF YOUR SCHEDULE IS ALREADY FULL, YOU CAN GENTLY ASK IF SOMEONE ELSE COULD DO THIS IF POSSIBLE... COMMUNICATION IS VERY IMPORTANT AT WORK AND IT IS VERY NORMAL TO EXPERIMENT THIS... ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE A LOT OF TALENTS AND INTELLIGENCE LIKE YOU, IT IS NORMAL THAT UP ABOVE SENDS US A LOT OF THINGS TO DO 😇 WE SIMPLY NEED TO MANAGE IT WELL, IN THE RIGHT BALANCE... This week my work is quite difficult to receive and think. It has reactivated my cold head quite a lot. Last year I talked about the cold inside of me, especially the head. My brain would freeze to stone when I had to think too much, and it was quite painful so I had to stop working for a long time before I could continue. COLDNESS OR NUMBNESS CAN ALSO HAPPEN AS A COMPENSATION TO THE OVERHEATING OF YOUR THOUGHTS WHEN YOU FOCUS ON ONLY ONE ASPECT OF LIFE THEREBY TURNING COLD TOWARDS OTHER ASPECTS (MORE IN YOUR THOUGHTS, THE WAY YOU PLAN YOUR DAY OR YOUR LIFE ETC.)... IT IS A CALL FOR YOU TO BALANCE... TAKE OUT TIME 15-20 MINS TO MEDITATE, DO SOME BREATHING EXERCISES OR YOGA TO REGULATE AND HARMONIZE YOUR THOUGHTS... ALWAYS REMEMBER TO FOCUS ON THE PROCESS OF DOING YOUR BEST AND NOT WORRYING TOO MUCH ABOUT THE RESULTS, AS THE LATTER IS A CAUSE OF EXPECTATIONS, IMBALANCE, COMPETITION ETC. As I received the interpretation of dreams last year, my illness comes from memories of repressing negative thoughts, aggression when I was a leader in past lifes. So it built up and created this cold. At the same time, before that, I also went through a rather long time of being insensitive and cold to everything. I have been slowly healing this. However, the physical cold is still there. Maybe this is a dream that also reminds me that I should focus on healing it. YES DEAR NHU... PHYSICAL COLD CAN ALSO BE DUE TO LACK OF WARMTH THAT YOU CAN SOMETIMES FEEL FROM WITHIN... TRY TO ORGANIZE YOUR DAY WHERE IT HAS SCOPE FOR OTHER THINGS APART FROM WORK... :-) Also I'm pretty confused these days, I don't know which Angel or distortion I should continue with. Because I find I always have many distortions to work with and where should I start, what should I switch to, how to transform it, how to apply it to my life, to transform the distortions in turn. Each dream showed me a lot of things to transform but how should I move forward to start my transformation. It make me confused quite a bit. I hope to receive your advise. Thank you EVERY ANGEL CAN EQUALLY HELP YOU TO TRANSFORM AND CLEANSE THE BLOCKAGES AND MEMORIES THAT YOU WISH TO WORK UPON ... THIS IS BECAUSE FOR ANY PERSON, HIS/HER MEMORIES, PATTERNS, TENDENCIES ETC. ARE INTERLINKED OR CONNECTED WITH EACH OTHER...LIKE IN YOUR DREAM ABOVE MEMORIES OF LACK OF LOVE AND ATTENTION CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON YOUR WORK, REATIONSHIPS, SOCIAL DYNAMICS, FAMILY DYNAMICS ETC... YOU SEE ITS ALL BUNDLED UP IN A WAY :-)... BUT IF YOU WANT TO DEEPEN YOUR WORKING DYNAMICS, ANGEL MENADEL CAN BE A GOOD CHOICE... SO ITS MOST IMPORTANT TO HAVE GOOD INTENTION AND THAT WILL GUIDE YOUR INTUITION TO CONNECT WITH A SPECIFIC ANGEL... YOU CAN ALSO FOLLOW THE ANGEL CALENDAR THEREBY WORKING ON ALL THE DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR... JUST FOLLOW YOUR INTUITION, THIS IS A PATH OF SPIRITUAL AUTONOMY DEAR INITIATE WISHING YOU A WONDERFUL INTEGRATION OF TRUE MEANING OF WORK AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH ANGELS MENADEL AND PAHALIAH ANGELIC BLESSINGS ALEXIS

PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 1 April 2022 Angel: 36 Menadel Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello Professor ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU I chanted angel Manadel with the question: Is my current job in line with the evolution of my soul? OK... IT IS A GOOD PRACTICE TO PUT PRECISE INENTIONS WHILE ASKING FOR GUIDANCE IN DREAMS.. Here is my dream: I go to a dermatologist [- Skin represents external protection. The doctor represents the ability to heal. Dermatologists represent the ability to heal externally on a physical level. The minus is difficulty in healing, difficulty in identifying problems that need to be healed, superficiality ALSO SKINS THROUGH ITS SENSORY QUALITIES HELPS ONE TO PERCIEVE PHYSICALLY AND METAPHYSICALLY HIS/HER SURROUNDINGS... DEVELOPING CLAIRSENTIENCE THAT CAN ENABLE A PERSON TO RECIEVE AND DECODE DATA OF HIS/HER SURROUNDINGS THROUGH SENSITIVITY, PERCEPTION AND INTUITION... SO HERE YOU ARE CONNECTING WITH A PART OF YOUR FEMININE POLARITY (EMOTIONAL SELF) WHICH HAS A CAPACITY TO IDENTIFY AND HEAL THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS THAT ARE BLOCKING YOUR CAPACITY TO BALANCE YOUR SENSITIVITY... ] . The clinic is a small, old and dark house [- ancient structure, ancient memory in the unconscious REPRESENTS YOUR UNCONSCIOUS INNER STRUCTURE WHICH HAS OLD PATTERNS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN TRANSFORMED... ALSO, SMALL REFLECTS NOTIONS OF INFERIORITY COMPLEX... SO YOU SEE YOUR INNER DERMATOLOGIST IS STILL OPERATING FROM OLD PATTERS ALONG WITH UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES OF INFERIORITY WHICH CAN SOMETIMES LIMIT YOUR CAPACITY TO HEAL ] . I have been to this female doctor a few times before. I am visiting old memories of my own healing power, inner and outer. The present shows that I have begun to identify my problems and begin to heal. YES WELL UNDERSTOOD DEAR NHU...HOWEVER THE INNER OLD DARK HOUSE CAN SOMETIMES CREATE BLOCKAGES IN YOUR CAPACITY TO HEAL This time, the doctor said: my skin had cured a lot GOOD SO THIS MEANS YOU ARE WORKING WELL ON YOUR MEMORIES AND AFFECTIVE SOUL STATES...AND HEALING IS ALREADY IN PROGRESS , but there were still small acne spots [- incapacity to transform negative memories, hypersensitive, lack of discernment YES SO NOW YOU CAN GO DEEPER TO UNDERSTAND THE SYMBOLIC ESSENCE OF ACNE, WE INVITE YOU TO REFER TO THE SOURCE CODE DICTIONARY AS WELL FOR THE SYMBOL OF SKIN... ACNE DEPICTS MEMORIES OF LACK OF LOVE, SELF-ESTEEM, GIVING TOO MUCH IMPORTANCE TO WHAT OTHERS THINK OF YOU... THIS CAN SOMETIMES CREATE REPRESSIONS, FRUSTRATIONS & IRRITATIONS AS WELL, THIS IS ALSO RELATED TO MEMORIES OF REJECTION... WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONNECT THIS WITH THE SITUATIONS IN YOUR JOB AND AS YOU HAD PUT AN INTENTION... TO SEE IF SOMETIMES YOU CAN FEEL LACKS OF SELF-ESTEEM AT WORK... LACKS OF RECOGNITION... BUT BY RESONANCE IT IS IMPORTANT TO WORK ON IT INSIDE OF YOU FIRST... THIS CAN POSSIBLY SHOW THE BLOCKAGES WHICH CAN CREATE DIFFICULTIES TO TRANSCEND THE SITUATIONS RELATED TO YOU JOB... ] , so I should take the medicine [- represent the treatment. The minus is the dependency THE MEDICINE FOR YOUR SOUL...AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO KEEP CONTINUING YOUR WONDERFUL INNER WORK ] for another month. After that, if these small acnes are still present, I should stop taking the medicine and meet her again to see what the problem is. THIS PART OF THE DREAM IS POINTING TOWARDS THAT THERE IS STILL SOME MORE WORK TO BE DONE BEFORE YOU TAKE A DECISION RELATED TO YOUR JOB... YOUR INNER DOCTOR HAS ADVISED YOU TO KEEP WORKING WITH ANGELIC INTENTIONS AND THEN REVIEW THE SITUATION AFTER SOMETIME... ONCE THIS INNER ACNE IS HEALED THEN SOME NEW POSSIBILITIES MIGHT OPEN UP... HAVING SAID THAT WE SUGGEST TO NOT SOW ANY SEED OF EXPECTATIONS IN YOUR MIND... JUST KEEP FOCUSSING ON YOUR INNER WORK WITH PATIENCE, LOVE AND PERSISTENCE Now I feel relieved because it's like the doctor is speaking for me. Because I also think that the treatment is basically gone, but I don't understand why these spots keep popping up.Then I thanked the doctor and I went home. YES... BECAUSE IN A WAY YOUR SOUL KNOWS WHAT THE MEDICINE IS (SELF-WORK) BUT THE % OF UNCONSCIOUS NEGATIVE MEMORIES KEEP POPPING UP SOMETIMES AND HAVE NOT YET BEEN COMPLETELY CLEANSED... ALSO IN A SUBTLE WAY IT IS TELLING YOU TO FOCUS ON YOUR EFFORT AND THE PROCESS AND NOT THE RESULT... IT WILL HAPPEN ON ITS OWN... The dream shows that I am still too focused on results, wanting quick results. Meanwhile, I need to work with myself to transform resonant memories. The dream also shows that when I do my current job, I feel physically healed, however, it also indicates underlying issues that have not been deepened. I am still superficial with identifying and working with myself to understand knowledge and apply it to life. WELL DISCERNED DEAR NHU... ALSO REFER TO THE COMMENTS ABOVE IT IS A DREAM THAT TELLS YOU TO WORK ON YOUR SELF-ESTEEM AT WORK... NOT TO DEPEND TOO MUCH ON OTHERS ENCOURAGING OR SUPPORTING YOU... BECAUSE WHEN WE DO THIS TOO MUCH, WE CAN LOSE OUR MOTIVATION, WILL TO DO THINGS WELL... OR WE BECOME OVER-SENSITIVE TO THE REMARKS OF OTHERS... THIS IS WHY WE NEED TO DO IT FROM THE INSIDE, ENCOURAGE OURSELVES WELL TO REINFORCE OUR SELF-ESTEEM AND BE CONFIDENT IN OUR QUALITIES... This dream is like a reality to me that happened over a week ago. I was also going to a dermatologist, a female doctor. She is different from the doctor in my dreams, the space is also different. I have been to the doctor a few times and have not cleared most of the acne. However, there are still a few acne spots that keep popping up and not going away (like in a dream). But the last time I went to the doctor, the doctor definitely told me: if you take the medicine this time, the acne will definitely go away. And I just said thank you and went home. I think this dream took place because my desire to change that doctor's answer was too high, so the dream turned out just as I wanted it to. YES, ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO DECODE AND UNDERSTAND CONCRETE LIFE INCIDENTS SYMBOLICALLY AND PERCIEVE WHAT THE UNIVERSE IS TRYING TO TELL YOU DEAR NHU WISHING YOU AN ANGELIC TRANSCENDENCE OF THE NEGATIVE MEMORIES SO AS ENABLE AND ACTIVATE YOUR CLAIRSENTIENCE TO RECONNECT WITH A BALANCED SELF-ESTEEM AND RECOGNIZE YOUR GREAT QUALITIES...

    "dream_text": "I go to a dermatologist. The clinic is a small, old and dark house. I have been to this female doctor a few times before. I am visiting old memories of my own healing power, inner and outer. The present shows that I have begun to identify my problems and begin to heal. This time, the doctor said: my skin had cured a lot, but there were still small acne spots, so I should take the medicine for another month. After that, if these small acnes are still present, I should stop taking the medicine and meet her again to see what the problem is. Now I feel relieved because it's like the doctor is speaking for me. Because I also think that the treatment is basically gone, but I don't understand why these spots keep popping up.Then I thanked the doctor and I went home. The dream shows that I am still too focused on results, wanting quick results. Meanwhile, I need to work with myself to transform resonant memories. The dream also shows that when I do my current job, I feel physically healed, however, it also indicates underlying issues that have not been deepened. I am still superficial with identifying and working with myself to understand knowledge and apply it to life. This dream is like a reality to me that happened over a week ago. I was also going to a dermatologist, a female doctor. She is different from the doctor in my dreams, the space is also different. I have been to the doctor a few times and have not cleared most of the acne. However, there are still a few acne spots that keep popping up and not going away (like in a dream).

title_pdf: Conscious & Unconscious. last case id: C0226. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 8 April 2022 Angel: 36 Menadel Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello Professor ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU I'm in my parents' bedroom [- represent the harmony of my two polarities. The minus is lack of ability to nourish and properly understand two polarities, imbalance YOUR DREAM STARTS WITH PARENT'S BEDROOM. SO THIS CONNECTS WITH MEMORIES RELATED TO YOUR CAPACITY TO INTERIORIZE, ASPECTS RELATED TO INTIMACY AND SINCE IT BELONGS TO YOUR PARENTS IT CAN ALSO POINT TOWARDS MEMORIES RELATED TO ORIGIN/ROOT OF YOUR INNER COUPLE, CAUSE RELATED TO BLOCKAGES IN YOUR INTIMACY OWING TO OLD PATTERNS ] , in the old house [- ancient memories, inner structures, old patterns ] . I was about to go to bed SO YOU WERE ABOUT TO INTERIORIZE, BALANCE YOURSELF ETC. BUT WHAT CAN STOP IT... IS SHOWN FUTHER... when I received a phone call [- represent communication quickly and conveniently. The minus point is that the person is superficial, hasty, aggressive, lacks clarity, has problems at the female pole - lack of listening ] from Mrs.Thanh [- A PART OF YOUR FEMININE POLARITY (WORLD OF EMOTIONS RELATED TO WORK) She is the business owner, my business partner. She is a leader with heart and ambition. Her minus is lack of love, too many material needs, likes to show off, lack of recognition ] . She asked me urgently for help, I reassured her and I asked her what was the problem. SO ASPECTS RELATED TO A PART OF YOUR EMOTIONS (INNER THANH) I.E. LACK OF LOVE, MATERIALISM, SHOW OFF ETC. CAN SOMETIMES CALL FOR ATTENTION A BIT TOO MUCH IN THE WAY YOU CONNECT (PHONE CALL)... THIS CAN AT TIMES MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO REPLENISH, REJUVENATE, INTERIORIZE AND BALANCE YOURSELF IN YOUR INNER BEDROOM... NOW YOUR INNER MRS. THANH HAS GOT YOUR ATTENTION AND THERE IS SOME URGENCY... LET US UNDERSTAND THIS ASPECT FURTHER. I lack the inner communication to really understand my distortions, currently, I am identifying in a superficial, not deep way. Distortions of my inner Thanh have woken me up. Here's an invitation from Up Above to let me work on distortions: lack of love, too many material needs, likes to show off, lack of recognition. WELL OBSERVED She sent me a clip [- people tend to live in the past, lack of reality ALSO A PART OF YOU RECORDED PAST (UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES) AND AN EXTRACT IS BEING SHOWN TO YOU ] . This clip shows her grandmother [- a part of my unconscious belongs to feminine polarity, old memories NOTIONS OF LACK OF WISDOM, DIFFICULTY TO LEARN THROUGH EXPERIENCES (IN THE WAY YOU FEEL UNCONSCIOUSLY)... THESE ASPECTS ARE IN RELATION WITH THE % IF INNER MRS. THANH IN YOU ] seemingly possessed by a ghost [- a part of my unconscious, aggressive, suppress, instinctive needs, forcing a lot of power, lack of faith, anger and rebellious, a desire to control YES WELL CONNECTED... ALSO POSSESSED BRINGS TO CONSIDERATION AN ESSENCE OF DOMINATION, CONTROL, NEGATIVE AUTHORITY , WHEN A PERSON GETS SO DRIVEN BY HIS/HER NEEDS, MEMORIES OR PATTERNS THAT HE/SHE IS NOT ABLE TO DISCERN ANYMORE... ITS LIKE THE FREEDOM TO THINK, FEEL AND ACT HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY AND IS NOW BEING CONTROLLED BY THE NEEDS AS REPRESENTED BY A % OF MRS. THANH IN YOU ] and flying inside the house, flying around on the ceiling [- disordered thinking, hyperactivity, insanity, uncontrollable negative thoughts, and strong instinctive needs, lack of love, tolerance, empathy BECAUSE OF ASPECTS LIKE LACK OF LOVE, MATERIALISM, SHOW-OFF, LACK OF RECIGNITION ETC. ] . Grandmother laughed and spoke menacingly like a witch UNCONSCIOUS PARTS OF YOUR EMOTIONAL WORLD WHICH CAN BE EGOISTIC, CRUDE, AGGRESSIVE IN A %.. ALSO REPRESENTS THAT EVIL CAN BECOME POWERFUL AND INTELLIGENT WITH MULTIDIMENSIONAL CAPABILITIES THAT CAN USED FOR NEGATIVE PURPOSES . She flew like a flying broom, NOTIONS OF EMISSIVITY.. ALSO BROOM IS USUALLY USED TO CLEAN AND REMOVE DIRT ETC. BUT HERE IT IS BEING USED TO FLY... SO IN A WAY REFLECTS A % OF EMISSIVE THOUGHTS IN YOU WHICH CAN TAKE AWAY YOUR CAPACITY TO CLEANSE OR REMOVE THE DIRT OF OLD NEGATIVE UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES THAT IS BEING ACCUMALATED her face and voice were very scary REPRESENTS YOUR SOUL-STATES IN A % WHICH CAN BE POSSESSED AND CAN INTIMIDATE . She didn't know what to do and she begged for help. Thanh called me for help very urgently and I think she call for everyone around. SO WHEN YOUR INNER THANH IS SHOWN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WISDOM IS NOT APPLIED AND WHEN ONE BLINDLY GETS DRIVEN BY HIS/HER NEEDS OR MEMORIES... SHE GETS SCARED... THIS PART OF THE DREAM SHOWS YOU THAT UNCLEANSED NEEDS CAN MAKE ONE FEEL LIKE SHE IS POSSESSED AND CAN TAKE AWAY DISCERNMENT, EMPATHY ETC. BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS ALREADY A GOOD SIGN THAT SHE ASKS FOR HELP... IT IS LIKE YOU OPENED THE VEIL ON THIS MEMORY AND NOW IT NEEDS TO BE SOLVED... AND THIS DREAM COULD EVEN CAUSE INSOMNIA IN YOU, AS YOU WERE ABOUT TO SLEEP IN THE BEGINNING... SO IT SHOWS ALSO HOW YOUR MEMORIES AND NEEDS CAN BE STRONGLY ACTIVATED AT NIGHT, WHEN YOUR UNCONSCIOUS IS OPENING MORE... AS THE WITCH REPRESENTS SPIRITUALITY IN YOU BUT THAT IS TINTED WITH PERSONAL NEEDS... SO YOU CAN REMIND TO DO THE MANTRA BEFORE TO SLEEP, DO A MEDITATION TO CALM DOWN THE NEEDS THAT COULD FOR EXAMPLE THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT WORK, SUCCESS, PLEASING OTHERS, ETC. IN THE NAME OF DOING YOUR BEST OR BECOMING A BETTER PERSON... I lack empathy and tolerance when I see the distortions in my unconscious (grandmother), I panic and want to hide in the past to forget the present. ALSO PLEASE REFER TO THE COMMENTS ABOVE... When I saw this scene, I was very scared. I told her that I'm just an ordinary content writer [- lack of ability to learn, understand, lack of ability to actualize, too theoretical ] , and I don't know how to help her. I refused and I tried to turn off the phone screen to get rid of the video with the horror face of Grandma, but I couldn't turn it off a few times. After a while, it was turned off. The clip made me quite scared and panicked. I reassured myself and covered my head with a blanket to try to sleep, but I still couldn't sleep. She kept texting and calling me for help, but I ignored it.YES, SO YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE BEING SHOWN YOUR INNER NEGATIVITY... YOU GET PANICKED... WHICH SYMBOLICALLY MEANS THAT IN A WAY YOU CAN SOMETIMES BE IN RESISTANCE AND FIND IT DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT THESE PARTS OF YOU... HELP ETC. IS THE NEXT STEP... FIRST STEP IS TO ACCEPT THESE PARTS OF YOU, THEN ONLY YOU CAN THINK OF DOING SOMETHING TO HELP YOUR INNER THANH...ALSO IT CAN BE NOTICED THAT WHEN FACED WITH DIFFICULTY YOUR INFERIORITY COMPLEX, ASPECTS OF BEING A VICTIM GETS TRIGGERED (WHEN YOU SAY, I AM JUST A CONTENT WRITER)... WHEREAS WHEN NOT CHALLENGED THEN YOU CAN ALSO BE LIKE YOUR INNER MRS. THANH'S GRANDMOTHER (SUPERIORITY COMPLEX, EGO)... YOU CAN SEE THE PRESENCE OF THESE 2 EXTREMES IN YOU IN A %... I run away, scared, lacking understanding of my resonances. GOOD UNDERSTANDING... I was so scared that I woke up. My body froze and I was scared. But then I practice breathing to calm myself. After a while, I said to myself: hey everything in my dreams is a part of me, it's my resonance, I shouldn't deny it and don't help like that, because I need to understand that is also helping myself. BEAUTIFUL REACTION... CONGRATULATIONS... YES IT CAN SOMETIMES BE A BIT OVERWHELMING TO WITNESS NEGATIVE ASPECTS THROUGH NIGHTMARES AS IT BREAKS MULTIPLE ILLUSIONS... BUT YOU DID A GOOD THING DEAR NHU BY FOCUSSING BACK ON YOUR BREATH TO CALM YOURSELF DOWN I.E. YOU INTRODUCED RECEPTIVITY IN YOUR THOUGHTS AND THAT STARTED TO HELP YOU TO ACCEPT YOUR RESONANCES AS SHOWN IN THE DREAM...WONDERFUL STEP I also realized that it was just a horror scene, and grandma still hasn't harmed anyone, she only flies and threatens by words. Thanh was also panicking, but nothing serious happened here, everyone has helped her also, so I should help her. After that, I said to myself: ok now I will go back to sleep, if I see Thanh again, I will help her. A GOOD REMINDER 😇 SO IN A WAY YOU ARE REALIZING THAT YOUR INNER GRANDMA IS IMPACTING YOUR THOUGHTS AND EXPRESSION ... BUT IF THIS IS NOT WORKED UPON AND IF THE INNER MULTIDIMENSIONAL BROOM IS NOT PUT TO RIGHT USE TO CLEANSE THE ACCUMALATED NEGATIVE MEMORIES, THEN YOUR INNER MRS. THANH'S GRANDMOTHER CAN COME FROM YOUR UNCONSCIOUS TO CONSCIOUS REALITY...BY MANIFESTING AS CERTAIN NEGATIVE ACTIONS OR SITUATIONS IN YOUR CONCRETE LIFE. I am gradually understanding knowledge at the conscious level (when I wake up, I can reassure myself), knowledge has not really penetrated into my unconscious (dream). I still depended on energy, the support of people around, lacked self-esteem and spiritual autonomy, I was clouded by fear. WELL SUMMARIZED, ALSO REFER TO THE COMMENTS ABOVE When I fell asleep, I dreamed that I went to Thanh's house, and I witnessed directly the scene of her grandma flying on the ceiling like in the clip. But I was less afraid, calmer and talked with her. I inquired about the root issues, I listened to her confidant. I feel that she is calmer, and at the same time, I am calmer myself. I feel like my fear has gone away a lot. WOW... GOOD, THIS REFLECTS A WONDERFUL POTENTIAL IN YOU TO FACE YOUR NEGATIVE MEMORIES, TO CONNECT WITH THEM CONFIDENTLY... NOW WITH ACCEPTANCE THERE IS 19/08/2025, 15:46 Conscious & Unconscious | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/94400 2/3 NO MORE FEAR, INNER GRANDMA IS ALSO LISTENING NOW... HOWEVER, AT THIS STAGE CLEANSING HAS NOT YET HAPPENED EVEN IF IT IS A VERY GOOD START... A CALL TO KEEP DEVELOPING YOUR POTENTIAL AND CAPACITY TO ONE DAY CLEANSE THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS AS REVEALED IN THE DREAM The end of the dream shows that I am trying to apply and understand more about knowledge, bringing it to my unconscious. While I continue chanting Angel Menadel this week, I had a little worried when I heard that my former boss (the past) and current boss (the present) met. They met for business cooperation, but also mentioned me. They talked about how I work and how should work with me, meaning they care about me. These are two bosses that I respect very much and they also like me very much. They are like my teammates. However, I don't know why I was a little worried inside when I heard that. I have nothing to hide and actually, I also told the 2 bosses about my work on both sides before. I think there are few distortions and problems in the past in work that I don't want to dig into to work, I have an avoidant attitude (similar to the beginning of the dream) so it creates this fear. THIS IS BECAUSE OF NEGATIVE MEMORIES STEMMING FROM INSECURITIES, BEING JUDGEMENTAL, MANAGING YOUR IMAGE/PERCEPTION IN FRONT OF OTHERS AND BEING DRIVEN BY WHAT OTHERS THINK ABOUT YOU ETC... AND THIS IS WHY THE GRANDMA WAS FLYING HERE... YOUR THOUGHTS HAD A SPIRITUAL INTENTION THAT HAS MIXED WITH NEEDS (WITCH SYMBOL)... A % OF YOU THAT WANTED THINGS FOR YOURSELF A LITTLE TOO MUCH, TO BE LOVED, ETC... AS A GOOD STUDENT YOU WERE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH THE IMBALANCE THAT GOT TRIGGERED IN YOU DUE TO MEETING BETWEEN YOUR BOSSES... THE DREAM ABOVE SHOWS YOU THE RESONANCES IN YOUR INNER WORLD (EMOTIONS) THAT CAN GOT TRIGGERED DUE TO NEEDS AND ASPECTS IN YOUR WORK AS SYMBOLICALLY REPRESENTED BY MRS. THANH... CONGRATULATIONS FOR YOUR BEAUTIFUL EFFORTS NHU... YOU ARE IMPROVING WEEK AFTER WEEK IN YOUR ANALYSIS AND IT IS VERY TOUCHING TO READ YOU... KEEP GOING LIKE THIS DEAR INITIATE 😇 WISHING YOU A WONDERFUL TRANSFORMATION AND INITIATIC INTEGRATION OF HOW THROUGH WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING ONE CAN CALM DOWN AND EVENTUALLY CLEANSE THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS WITH ANGELS MAHASIAH AND VEULIAH ANGELIC REGARDS, ALEXIS

title_pdf: Life - Hide. last case id: C0227. PDF text: Dream date: Tuesday, 19 April 2022 Angel: 39 Rehael Dream mood: Scare, afraid Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello Professor ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU :-) I invoke Angel 39 with the intention: please help me understand the submission. I am walking [- my capacity to advance on the social level. The minus is difficult to advance, selfish, lack of motivation to advance ] in a village with dusty yellow dirt roads [- village is my inner structure. village with dusty yellow dirt roads meaning difficult to actualize, difficult to change my inner structure with anxiety memories, lack of energy VILLAGE ON THE MINUS ALSO MEANS PATTERNS WHICH ARE OLD, LACKING PROGRESS/EVOLUTION ETC. AND TOO SELF-CENTERED, A CLOSED MENTALITY... AND THE YELLOW DIRT SHOWS MEMORIES OF LACKS OF CONFIDENCE OR OVER-CONFIDENCE IN THE WAY YOU ADVANCED TOWARDS OTHERS BECAUSE OF THESE VILLAGE MEMORIES... ] . Both sides of the road are old thatched houses IN ESSENCE, YOUR INNER STRUCTURE WHICH IS SOMETIMES NOT SO STRONG, IS STILL IN OLD WAYS OF DOING THINGS I.E. NEEDING A TRANSFORMATION. There are 2 policemen [- police represent security, protection, authority, justice. The minus is someone who abuses the power, coarse, aggressive, manipulates force. 2 policemen are a part of my inner masculine polarity, also related to my inner couple. Maybe I was too intense in my emissivity, too harsh, too aggressive while I lack of inner and outer justice ALSO YOU CAN ADD TO THE EQUATION THE ASPECTS RELATED TO HUMAN DISTORTIONS OF ANGEL 2 (JELIEL) - LACK OF LOVE & WISDOM, DIFFICULTIES IN RELATION WITH ADVANCEMENT AND YOUR INNER POLICE ] looking for certain objects [- negative memories, belong to my unconsciousness, the part was blocked and I was digging deep to recognize the memory blockages related to distortions of illegality, wrongness ] . And I belong to these objects. THE START OF THE DREAM DEPICTS THE THEME... IN THIS DREAM YOU ARE CONNECTING WITH OLD/ARCHAIC PATTERNS IN YOU WHICH CAN IMPACT YOUR ADVANCEMENT IN A NEGATIVE WAY. YOU ARE ALSO CONNECTING WITH THE VILLAGE FORCES IN YOU THAT ARE TOO SELF-CENTERED (IN A %) THAT CAN SOMETIMES CREATE BLOCKAGES AT THE LEVEL OF YOUR CONFIDENCE (YELLOW) IN ENFORCING THE PRINCIPLE OF INNER JUSTICE (SYMBOL OF POLICE)... AS CAN BE SEEN LATER IN THE DREAM, YOU ARE TRYING TO HIDE YOURSELF FROM THE POLICE DUE TO FEAR OF GETTING CAUGHT OF DOING SOMETHING ILLEGAL. SYMBOLICALLY THIS MEANS ASPECTS RELATED TO REBELLION, NEGATIVITY ETC. CAN MAKE YOU DISTANCE YOURSELF FROM YOUR OWN CAPACITY TO ESTABLISH DIVINE JUSTICE, TO FOLLOW THE DIVINE LAWS... BECAUSE YOU CAN BE THE POLICE SOMETIMES, AND BECOME TOO HARSH WITH OTHERS OR YOURSELF IN YOUR INNER JUSTICE... SO THIS CAN CREATE DIFFICILTIES TO TRUST OTHERS, TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN SOMEONE FOR EXAMPLE... I have negative memories related to illegality, wrongness, maybe even memories of crime, and they locked my capacity to advance on the social level. It can be related to my work, so my inner police appeared and warned me about these memories. YES WELL UNDERSTOOD :-)... ALSO REFER TO THE COMMENTS ABOVE... At this time, the street was empty, everyone was afraid and hid in their house MULTIPLE PARTS OF YOU WHICH KNOW THAT THEY ARE WRONG AND ARE HIDING OUT OF FEAR. THE EMOTION OF FEAR ALSO MEANS UNCONSCIOUS RESISTANCE IN A PERSON... SO HERE THESE PARTS OF YOU ARE NOT YET READY TO CHANGE... ITS LIKE THEY ARE TRYING TO DODGE/FOOL YOUR INNER POLICE BECAUSE THEY FEEL THEY COULD BECOME TOO INTENSE AT THE SAME TIME.... The houses are only closed with a bamboo curtain [- represent protection, shielding. The minus is lack of rigidity, looseness, superficiality, lack of inner security, old-fashioned ... YES WELL DISCERNED... BAMBOO BELONGS TO THE PLANT KINGDOM I.E. ASPECTS RELATED TO YOUR FEELINGS, EMOTIONS WHICH CAN BE RIGID (OPPOSITE OF FLEXIBILITY). ALSO THESE TREES ARE LONG/TALL STRUCTURES I.E. NOTIONS OF EMISSIVITY IN YOUR EMOTIONS... ANOTHER ASPECT OF BAMBOO TREES ARE THAT THEY ARE DEEP ROOTED AND KEEP GROWING EVEN AFTER BEING CUT... SO YOU SEE THESE ASPECTS CAN SOMETIMES CREATE A VEIL, A SORT OF BARRIER FROM YOUR INNER POLICE ] . I hid in a nearby house when I saw the police approaching. Then the police came to the house where I was hiding. They opened the bamboo curtain up but didn't see anyone,HIDDEN ASPECTS THAT YOUR INNER POLICE IS CURRENTLY NOT ABLE TO IDENTIFY... in the meanwhile, I hid on the other side so they couldn't see. ALSO IN THE DREAM, IT IS NOT SHOWN THAT YOU HAVE DONE SOMETHING BUT STILL YOU ARE HIDING FROM YOUR INNER POLICE... ITS LIKE YOU KNOW WITHIN THAT YOU HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG AND THIS CREATES FEAR, INSECURITY OF BEING CAUGHT... ITS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT POLICE IS DOING ITS WORK, AND IF YOU HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING WRONG THEN THERE IS NO NEED FOR YOU TO FEAR... ANOTHER ANGLE TO THIS EQUATION IS THAT YOU HAVE MEMORIES WHERE YOUR INNER POLICE WAS NOT SO GOOD - I.E. ASPECTS OF CORRUPTION, ABUSE OF POWER & AUTHORITY, MANIPULATION, DRIVEN BY PERSONAL NEEDS ETC. THIS CAN ALSO CREATE AN UNCONSCIOUS FEAR FROM YOUR INNER POLICE... These memories easily enter my inner structure (house). My inner structures are protected so superficially, not tightly, so easily receptive that they can cause any thought or distortion to sneak in. At the same time, my inner justice (police) is not strictly controlled, so I have not been able to find out these distortions to work properly. YOU SEE, IF SOMETHING ILLEGAL IS HAPPENING THEN IT IS THE DUTY OF POLICE TO INVESTIGATE AND RESOLVE THE ISSUE...ONE MORE PERSPECTIVE IS THAT YOUR INNER POLICE IS STARTING TO GET ACTIVATED AND IS SEARCHING FOR PARTS OF YOU WHICH ARE NOT NECESSARILY RIGHT, HOWEVER THE MINUS ASPECTS ARE STILL ABLE TO ESCAPE/HIDE BECAUSE OF ASPECTS MENTIONED ABOVE... ALSO THE INNER FEARS, MEMORIES OF ABUSE OF AUTHORITY & POWER ETC. CAN SOMETIMES CREATE THIS URGE TO RUN AWAY OR HIDE... AND THIS ALL COMES FROM THE VILLAGE MEMORIES WHERE YOU DIDN'T TRUST OTHERS ENOUGH IN THE SOCIAL... BECAUSE OF MEMORIES OF SELF-CENTEREDNESS, COMPARISON, JEALOUSY, GOSSIPING, ETC. THAT WE CAN FIND IN VILLAGES SOMETIMES... WITH YOUR CONTINUOUS INNER WORK, YOU SHALL EMPOWER YOUR INNER ANGELIC POLICE TO TRANSFORM THE INNER NEGATIVES WITH LOVE AND COMPASSION :-) Then there was a woman [- a part of my feminine polarity, belongs to my unconsciousness. She is kind, has no judgment, respects me whoever I am and helps me with all she can BUT HERE THIS SYMBOL IS TO BE SEEN ON THE MINUS... YOU SEE SHE IS TRYING TO HELP YOU RUN AWAY FROM YOUR INNER POLICE...AN UNCONSCIOUS PART OF YOUR EMOTIONAL WORLD THAT CAN MAKE YOU BE AT A DISTANCE FROM YOUR INNER POLICE... ITS LIKE A PART OF YOU WHICH IS FEARFUL OR WANTS TO AVOID FACING KARMIC CONSEQUENCES... YES IT CAN SOMETIMES BE OVERWHELMING AND UNCOMFORTABLE DEAR NHU... BUT RUNNING AWAY WILL NEVER BE A SOLUTION... ONE DAY AS % INCREASES THE LAW OF RETURN WILL COME INTO PLAY... THROUGH THIS DREAM YOU ARE BEING ENCOURAGED TO BE IN ACCEPTANCE OF YOUR NEGATIVE MEMORIES BUT WTH LOVE AND COMPASSION (CURRENTLY YOU ARE PERCIEVING YOUR INNER POLICE TO BE TOO STRICT) AND THIS WILL SET IN MOTION A PROCESS OF ANGELIC CLEANSING FOR YOU ] who helped me. The woman worked as a peddler [- is someone who sells simple, lightweight goods in a convenient way as they go everywhere, selling to everyone they meet. Represents communication on the collective level and the ability to move forward in society on the individual level. The minuses are difficulties in communicating and moving forward in society, they may be people with low self- esteem because of their situation and profession, lack of inner security NOTIONS OF LACK OF DISCERNMENT IN YOUR EXCHANGES (THAT ARE ALSO SOMETIMES DRIVEN BY NEEDS), INTERACTIONS ETC. DIFFICULTY TO APPLY KNOWLEDGE AS SOMETIMES SURVIVAL AND FULFILLMENT OF NEEDS BECOME TOO IMPORTANT. ITS LIKE NOT CARING WHETHER THE THINGS BEING SOLD ARE QUALITATIVE OR NOT, THE ONLY FOCUS IS TO MAKE SOME MONEY. NOTIONS OF BEING TOO DRIVEN BY MATTER... ] . At this time she took a bicycle carrying street food to the office [- represent my structure in the work area, social level, the ability to organize and materialize in the work. The minus is lack of ability to realize work, lack of ability to organize and communicate ALSO REFLECTS ON THE WRONG WAYS TO NOURISH 19/08/2025, 15:47 Hide | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/95049 2/4 YOUR MEMORIES OR ASPECTS RELATED TO WORK (THROUGH STREET FOOD WHICH MAY NOT ALWAYS BE OF GOOD QUALITY) ] to sell and she took me along. A part of me (woman) has a great tolerance, universal love accepts these negative memories, loves, protects and helps. Although I have difficulty moving forward in society (peddler), I seem to accept and be happy with that simple way and do not need to work too hard for material pursuits. THIS UNDERSTANDING MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE CORRECT DEAR NHU... YOU ARE NOT QUESTIONING YOUR INNER PEDDLER WOMAN... SYMBOLICALLY YOU CAN EMPOWER THOSE % IN YOU WHICH HELP YOU TO RUN AWAY FROM INNER POLICE... INSTEAD OF TRYING TO HELP YOUR INNER POLICE TO BE GENTLE, COMPASSIONATE TOWARDS SEARCHING, IDENTIFYING AND HEALING THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS THAT CREATE BLOCKAGES... YOU HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO PREPARE YOURSELF TO CONFRONT AND MEET YOUR INNER POLICE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS MAKING THEM SEARCH FOR YOU... ALSO IN A WAY YOU SOMETIMES DO NOT TRUST YOUR INNER POLICE TOO (OWING TO THE NEGATIVE MEMORIES RELATED TO POLICE SYMBOL AS EXPLAINED ABOVE) I wear a very large conical hat [- the conical hat belongs to the traditional costume of the Vietnamese people. The hat represents protection at the thought level. The conical hat represents the traditional way of thinking. The minus is that it is possible to be too old- fashioned, too conservative, rigid, imposing opinions, or too modern to forget the origin YES WELL CONNECTED DEAR NHU AND ALSO THE CONE SYMBOL IS EMISSIVE, TOO UNIDIRECTIONAL AND POINTY IN YOUR THOUGHTS... IT IS NOT USUAL FOR SOMEONE TO HIDE IN A HAT... SO EITHER THE HAT IS TOO BIG I.E. NOTIONS OF SUPERIORITY COMPLEX, EGO, SELF CENTEREDNESS, TENDENCY TO BE NOTICED & RECOGNIZED ETC. IN THE WAY YOU THINK... OR YOU ARE TOO SMALL I.E. NOTIONS OF INFERIORITY COMPLEX, INSECURITY, FEAR, TENDENCY TO BE OVEREMPOWERED BY THE EGOISTIC, HAUGHTY THOUGHTS... SO MUCH SO THAT IT CAN COVER YOU. HERE ALSO THERE IS AN ESSENCE OF WANTING TO HIDE, TO BLOCK SELF FROM INNER POLICE... AND IN VILLAGES, WE CAN FIND THIS ALSO... PEOPLE WHO WILL THINK THEY ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHERS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A BETTER JOB, BETTER SALARY, OR THEY HAVE GONE TO THE CITY AND BECAME RICHER ETC... ] that covers my whole body. I squatted down, and walked while sitting [- difficulty in receiving to move forward ] THESE ASPECTS AS MENTIONED ABOVE CAN MAKE YOU A BIT WEIGHED DOWN, CREATING DIFFICULTY FOR YOU TO SUBMIT AND HENCE CAUSING DIFFICULTIES TO ADVANCE (WALK), to hide. Everyone who saw it wondered and asked her what this was. She answered it was a cat [- lazy, aggressive, easily excitable MOST IMPORTANTLY REPRESENTATION OF NEEDS RELATED TO WANTING TOO MUCH INDEPENDENCE, MEMORIES OF ATTRACTION & REPULSION, EXPRESSING OR SEEKING LOVE ONLY ON YOUR OWN TERMS (BEING A BIT SELF CENTERED OR FOCUSSED ON OWN NEEDS IN ASPECTS OF LOVE AND CARE) ] she raised. It seems that everyone here knew this woman, so everyone respects her answer, delicately not asking any more questions or no one lifting the conical hat, although everyone finds it strange: Why does she need a big conical hat to cover such a cat? YES SO THESE PARTS OF YOU ARE QUESTIONING BUT STILL YOU ARE HIDDEN UNDER ILLUSORY PROTECTION.... I respect everyone as well as respect and accept my own distortions, however, out of respect, I sometimes ignore the wrong things I do, because maybe I am too lazy, too self-trusted, or too easily provoked by outside influences, so I haven't really acknowledged my problems, but I think I know and respect those wrong issues, accept it as a part of my program of life without proper justice.GOOD... YOU HAVE GOT THE MAIN ESSENCE OF ACCEPTING YOUR INNER NEGATIVES AND EMPOWERING YOUR INNER POLICE TO HELP ESTABLISH THE DIVINE LAWS IN YOUR LIFE... That morning I received this dream, when I woke up, I saw a dead lizard right in front of my room and ants around a lot and I cleaned it up. I think this shows me that my submission is meant to be related to an instinctive need OF COLD EMOTIONS, MEMORIES OF IMMOBILISM VERSUS HYPERACTIVITY, AS THE LIZARD CAN STAY IN THE SUN ALL DAY BUT RUN AWAY QUICKLY WHEN THERE IS A PROBLEM... IT IS CONNECTED TO THE VILLAGE MENTALITY, WHERE PEOPLE CAN SOMETIMES STAY TOO MUCH IN THEIR MINDSET, NOT WANT TO CHANGE AND BECOME SELF-CENTERED BECAUSE OF NEEDS FOR COMFORT, PEACE... BUT WHEN THERE IS A POTENTIAL CHANGE, THEY CAN CLOSE THEMSELVES AND RUN AWAY FROM NEW IDEAS THAT CAN CREATE INNOVATION... THIS IS WHY HERE YOU SEE VILLAGERS HIDING FROM THE POLICE... THERE ARE % IN YOU THAT COULD REFUSE CHANGE AT TIMES... BECAUSE OF MEMORIES WHERE IT WAS IMPOSED TOO MUCH FROM THE OUTSIDE WITH HARSHNESS, LIKE IN THE PAST WITH COLONIZATIONS, WHERE PEOPLE FROM BIG CITIES OR OTHER CIVILIZATIONS CAME IN VILLAGES TO IMPOSE NEW RULES OR REGULATIONS WITH VIOLENCE... THIS CAN CREATE A REJECTION OF SOCIETY WITH TIME AND A LACK OF TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN JUSTICE OR PEOPLE IN POWER... YOU CAN SEE UP COMMENTS TO COMPLETE HERE, AND MAKE LINKS WITH YOUR FAMILY STORY AND MEMORIES EVENTUALLY... 🙏 . That day was also the important day of the Talkshow event that I and my colleagues had worked so hard to prepare for a few days. The program performed quite well when running officially, although there were many errors in the test. However, the Vietnamese part was lived well, while the English translation had a sound problem at first, causing viewers to leave quite a lot. And this is also the main channel that I want to promote communication.

In my case is not, this shows that I am being over-fed in terms of self-nourishment, maybe I am over-consuming instinctive needs. BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT CAN ALSO BE POSITIVE IF IT DOESN'T CAUSE TOO MUCH PAIN, AND SHOWS AN EMERGENCE OF MORE STRUCTURE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF YOUR NEEDS...

    "dream_text": "I am walking in a village with dusty yellow dirt roads. Both sides of the road are old thatched houses. There are 2 policemen looking for certain objects. And I belong to these objects. At this time, the street was empty, everyone was afraid and hid in their house. The houses are only closed with a bamboo curtain. I hid in a nearby house when I saw the police approaching. Then the police came to the house where I was hiding. They opened the bamboo curtain up but didn't see anyone, in the meanwhile, I hid on the other side so they couldn't see. These memories easily enter my inner structure (house). My inner structures are protected so superficially, not tightly, so easily receptive that they can cause any thought or distortion to sneak in. At the same time, my inner justice (police) is not strictly controlled, so I have not been able to find out these distortions to work properly. Then there was a woman who helped me. The woman worked as a peddler. At this time she took a bicycle carrying street food to the office to sell and she took me along. I wear a very large conical hat that covers my whole body. I squatted down, and walked while sitting to hide. Everyone who saw it wondered and asked her what this was. She answered it was a cat she raised. It seems that everyone here knew this woman, so everyone respects her answer, delicately not asking any more questions or no one lifting the conical hat, although everyone finds it strange: Why does she need a big conical hat to cover such a cat? That morning I received this dream, when I woke up, I saw a dead lizard right in front of my room and ants around a lot and I cleaned it up.",

title_pdf: Change appearance. last case id: C0228. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 6 May 2022 Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello Professor, ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU This is a dream that I really want to decode, but last week I couldn't finish it, so I come back with it. Thank you for your understanding Alexis YOU ARE WELCOME NHU :) My intention: please help me understand my rigidity. My group of 4 people: 2 men & 2 women [- represent Angel 4 Elemiah - Divine Power, human distortions are about diabolic power directed toward the satisfaction of personal needs; inertia, destructive tendencies. Also, I think can interpret Angel 22 Yeiayel ( 2 men and 2 women) as about megalomaniac, tyrant, profiteer; slavery, repression WELL UNDERSTOOD ... HOWEVER YOU CAN ALSO ADD THE SYMBOL OF FRIENDS IN THE EQUATION TO KNOW ASPECTS RELATED TO YOUR INNER AFFINITIES ] (this is my teammate and friend) IN THIS DREAM YOU CONNECT WITH ASPECTS RELATED TO YOUR AFFINITIES, CAPACITY TO HELP/SUPPORT (INNER FRIENDS), YOUR SOCIAL ASPECTS broke into BREAKING INTO SOME PLACE BRINGS IN AN ESSENCE OF FORCED OR UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY... THIS CAN SOMETIMES MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO ACCEPT THE NATURAL RHYTHM, ITS LIKE WANTING THINGS TOO FAST... THIS CAN OPEN UP ASPECTS FOR WHICH YOU MAY NOT BE READY YET AND HENCE CAN CREATE CONFUSIONS IN YOU... an organization [- belonging to my unconscious, my inner structure, order and arrangement. The minus is lack of ability to organize, create order, lack of discipline ] to save people. This organization is based in a spaceship [- belongs to the thinking world, and also carries emissivity energy. The minus is too dreamy, flighty, unrealistic, lacks the ability to actualize YES YOU HAVE DECODED IT WELL... AN ORGANIZATION ON A SPACESHIP BRINGS IN ASPECTS OF BEING TOO AIRY, LACK OF CONNECT FROM EARTHLY REALITIES WHICH CAN BLOCK YOUR CAPACITY TO MATERIALIZE... ALSO YOU BREAK IN TO THIS PLACE TO HELP OTHERS I.E. SOMETIMES NOTIONS OF HELPING/ALTRUISM ETC. CAN BE MORE IN CONCEPT (THOUGHT) AND NOT MUCH IN ACTION...SPACESHIP IS AN IMPORTANT SYMBOL HERE DEAR NHU - IT ALSO BRINGS IN AN ESSENCE (ON THE NEGATIVE) THAT YOU MAY NOT BE READY OR OPEN ENOUGH YET TO UNDERSTAND THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL ASPECTS IN YOUR UNCONSCIOUS... FORCING IT TOO MUCH CAN LEAD TO RIGIDITY AND LACK OF RECEPTIVITY IN YOU ] , which is quite modern. This organization turns people into other people to become a powerful army [- represents obedience at the social level. The minus is abuse of power, oppression, aggression, slavery, lack of discipline ] , following their orders. Perhaps through genetic modification, or artificially [- abuse of power, act on instinct ] , giving the army special abilities (similar to like Xmen movies). YES SO YOU SEE, YOU ARE BEING SHOWN MEMORIES IN YOU RELATED TO DIFFICULTIES WITH AUTHORITY, RIGIDITY (ANOTHER MINUS OF ARMY), SUPERIORITY COMPLEX, EGO AND TENDENCY TO BE FORCEFUL ON OTHERS AND YOURSELF TOO... THESE ARE COLLECTIVE SYMBOLS AS WELL WHICH ON THE MINUS CAN CALUSE LARGE SCALE HARM.... THIS DEPICTS THAT SOME PARTS OF YOU CAN SOMETIMES PLAY WITH THE NEGATIVE FORCES BY BEING A BIT TOO PUSHY AND BECOME EXTREMIST AT THE SPIRITUAL LEVEL AT TIMES (SPACESHIP + BECOMING AN ARMY)... AS IF YOU COULD HAVE FORCES THAT COULD ATTACK OTHERS WITH YOUR SPIRITUALITY AT TIMES... THIS CAN TRIGGER NEGATIVE ASPECTS IN YOU WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN TRANSFORMED... AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE MANY DISTURBANCES IN YOUR LIFE. ARTIFICIAL GENETIC MODIFICATION IS LIKE AN ENERGY OF FORCEFULLY CHANGING YOUR INNER CODES...SUCH STEPS CAN CREATE RIPPLES AND CAN TRIGGER DIFFICULTIES FOR YOU... The opening of the dream shows that I am going into the memory related to megalomaniac, tyrant, profiteer; slavery, and repression (Angel 22) in order to fulfill an ideal, a great desire (spaceship). There may have been previous lives where I was part of the army that took over the colonies or even the leadership team to lead this. And it also shows that I have minus points in the role of a leader who wants to oppress, impose, and need others to follow me too much, which creates rigidity in my thinking and acting. I think this dream is the answer to the question: why I have the rigidity inside me. I can also understand it through my illness (cold inside, the brain always feels cold and frozen when I think too much). PLEASE ALSO REFER TO THE COMMENTS ABOVE... THIS DREAM SHOWS ESSENCES OF SPIRITUAL EXTREMISM IN YOU, THAT ARE AT THE ORIGIN OF YOUR RIGIDITY... AND YOU WANT TO RECTIFY IT NOW (SAVE PEOPLE)... YOU CAN CONSIDER THIS AS A LEARNING TO NOT BE TOO PUSHY AND INSTEAD BE IN ACCEPTANCE OF YOUR OWN NATURAL RHYTHM OF EVOLUTION... RIGIDITY ARISES WHEN ONE IS INCAPABLE TO ACCEPT THE NATURAL FLOW OF SELF AND OTHERS OR TO BE RECEPTIVE TO RECEIVE FROM THE UNIVERSE.... EVERYTHING IN THIS UNIVERSE HAPPENS AT THE RIGHT TIME, AT THE RIGHT PACE... YOU CANNOT FORCE A SEED TO BECOME A TREE NEXT DAY DEAR NHU... WHEN THAT SEED GERMINATES AND GROWS AT ITS OWN RHYTHM, IT BECOMES A BEAUTIFUL NOURISHING TREE... THERE IS SO MUCH TO LEARN FROM NATURE When we broke in, we were discovered and arrested. YES...SO WHENEVER YOU FORCE OR BECOME TOO PUSHY TO ENTER YOUR INNER SPACESHIP, PARTS OF YOU CAN GET YOU ARRESTED I.E. YOU SHALL EXPERIENCE ESSENCES OF BEING LIMITED, RESTRCITED, IMPATIENCE, DEPRIVED OF YOUR LIBERTY / AUTONOMY... IT IS YOUR OWN EXTREMISM THAT TURNS AGAINST YOU IN A WAY, BECAUSE WHEN YOU WANT TO STOP BEING RIGID, YOU COULD BECOME TOO EXTREME AND RELEASE IT ALL TOO MUCH... SO THIS COULD MAKE YOU LACK THE ENERGY OF THE ARMY = BEING MORE LAZY, LACK MOTIVATION, ETC... THIS IS WHY YOU ARE ARRESTED HERE, AS IF YOU COULD SOMETIMES FEEL BLOCKED WHEN WORKING ON RIGIDITY, BECAUSE BEING RIGID BRINGS YOU ALSO A FORM OF WILL POWER IN ACTION... BUT YOU DON'T HAVE IT ANYMORE WHEN WANTING TO TRANSFORM IT TOO QUICKLY... GOING FROM ONE EXTREME (TOO RIGID) TO THE OTHER (TOO LAZY) EVENTUALLY... ALSO WHEN ONE DOES NOT USE FREE WILL APPROPRIATELY, HE/SHE GETS ARRESTED TO LEARN THE TRUE MEANING OF DISCERNMENT AND RESPECTING THE SPACE AND RHYTHM OF OTHERS.... The first two men and women who received the information penalty [- represents the education of the bad, the not so good, and a warning for people to change. The minus is difficulty in accepting and understanding mistakes and correcting mistakes, resistance to punishment, tendency to avoid, fear, lack of understanding that evil is for education ] through a messenger sent through a piece of paper [- represents the ability to realize ideas. The piece of paper can be understood as the lack of receptivity to actualize ] . I don't remember exactly what the punishment is, but they'll be kept behind to do something and will be kept in human form. When I finished reading it, I realized that at least they had a chance to escape in the process. PARTS OF YOU WHICH CAN SOMETIMES REFUSE TO GROW AND EVOLVE FROM SITUATIONS.... CAN HAVE DIFFICULTY TO APPLY THE LAW OF RESONANCE, TO NOT BE IN ACCEPTANCE .... TENDENCY TO BLAME OTHERS AND IN A WAY ESCAPE FROM TRANSFORMING ONESELF....ALSO THESE PARTS WERE NOT FORCEFULLY GENETICALLY MUTATED.... AS YOU SAID IT WAS LIKE A WARNING TO NOT 'BREAK IN' AGAIN WITHOUT AUTHORITY... I still can't accept the negative memory, or really recognize what it is inside. At the same time, I still don't really understander the knowledge learned to transform so I still have this resistance inside. VERY WELL SEEN..... In my turn, I was transformed into a gilded human [- is a fake appearance to hide the real person inside, but this is an action influenced by others PARTS OF YOU, so it can be understood that I am letting views, thoughts, and desires of other people or society impose on me because I lack confidence or overconfident in some cases THIS PART OF THE DREAM SHOWS A TENDENCY TO SHOW-OFF, HAVING NEEDS TO SHINE, LACK OF AUTHENTICITY, DISCREPANCIES IN THE WAY OU FEEL AND THE WAY YOU APPEAR SOMETIMES...A SMALL % IN YOU stop breathing - 19/08/2025, 15:48 Change appearance (again) | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/96134 2/4 WHICH CAN UNCONSCOUSLY BE A BIT FORCEFUL IN THE NAME OF HELPING OTHERS DRIVEN BY THIS NEED TO SHINE... YOU SEE WHAT IS BEHIND YOUR EXTREMISM AT TIMES... WANTING TO BE SUPER ORGANIZED, DISCIPLINE AND STRUCTURED (TURNING INTO ARMY) BUT MORE TO SHOW-OFF AT TIMES... ] , similar to their army. Before I could do anything, I was brought into the machine right next to me. The machine has 2 classes [- related to the lack of inner love, the inner relationship, absence of wisdom - Angel 2 Jeliel ] . I was brought to the center by the force of movement without anyone touching me as if I could fly and go up on my own YES PATTERNS AND TENDENCIES WHICH CAN MAKE YOU GRAVITATE TOWARDS THESE NEEDS. Going through the first class, I was covered with a yellow layer, the whole body from head to toe (like the blue Xmen character). I don't know what my special ability is IT IS WORTH CONTEMPLATING THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE BEING FOCREFULLY RECODED (GENETIC MUTATION), YOU WILL BECOME A PART OF NEGATIVE POWERFUL ARMY, BUT STILL IN A SUBTLE WAY YOU ARE ALSO KEEN AND FOCUSED ON YOUR SPECIAL ABILITIES/ POWER... THIS IS AN EXTENTION TO THE GOLD LAYER... A PART OF YOU WHICH CAN SOMETIMES INVITE TROUBLE OR CAN GET EMBROILED INTO DIFFICULT SITUATIONS TO GET RECOGNITION (SHINING OF GOLD), SPECIAL POWERS ETC.... ITS LIKE FOR SOME PEOPLE BEING NORMAL CAN BE BORING AND THIS MAKES THEM EXPERIMENT WITH THEIR NEGATIVE ASPECTS (WITHOUT BEING READY TO SEE WHAT IS IN STORE FOR THEM)... AND DEVELOP SOME QUALITIES OF ORGANIZATION, STRUCTURE, ETC. BUT WITH A NEGATIVE INTENTION BEYOND... . Through the next class, I was inlaid with a darker gold layer. This scene show that my memories related to lack confidence or pleasure other people too much. After that, I was given a mask [- represents protection. Minus points are hiding, hiding intentions, thoughts, lack of inner security DISCREPANCIES IN YOUR SOUL STATE VIS-A-VIS WHAT APPEARS ON THE OUTSIDE ] to cover my nose and mouth [- nose represents the reception and purification of air (thoughts) AND CAPACITY TO SMELL, WHICH ON THE MINUS IS RELATED WITH LOWER CHAKRAS I.E. NEEDS, INSTINCTUAL, ANIMALISTIC TENDENCIES. The mouth represents the physical intake of energy (food) I.E. NOURISHING YOURSELF WITH NEGATIVE, ILLUSORY ASPECTS... MOUTH ALSO REPRESENTS CAPACITY TO COMMUNICATE (WITH SELF AND OTHERS)... NEEDS TO SHINE CAN SOMETIMES LEAD TO BLOCKAGES IN YOU TO COMMUNICATE/EXPRESS IN THE RIGHT WAY . These two parts are both receiving places as the basic source of human life, related to instinct energy. The minus is too focused on material needs, instinctive needs ] because it glowed [- represents the aura. The minus is lack of recognition, desire for prominence, bragging ] . This is considered a sign to identify their army. When I was finished, I was brought back to the old place with the group. MEMORIES RELATED TO SUCH NEGATIVE EXPERIMENTATIONS... IN THIS DREAM YOU ARE BEING SHOWN THAT THESE ASPECTS (IF NOT CLEANSED) CAN GET REPEATED IF YOU KEEP TRYING TO METAPHYSICALLY 'BREAK IN' ... HOWEVER, IF YOU KEEP CONTINOUSLY WORKING ON YOURSELF AT YOUR NATURAL RHYTHM THEN ONE DAY YOU WON'T HAVE ANY NEED FOR A MASK OR SHINE Everyone was surprised and sympathized with me, because I was made into their army forever. People give me a secret: stop breathing [- breath represents the act of receiving and exhaling air (thinking). Stop breathing in this case means stopping receiving negative thoughts related to memories of oppression, abuse of power, aggression, domination (army) ] for a moment, then the light will disappear. I did it. I stopped breathing for a very long time, then the light really disappeared, completely disappeared at that moment, and I took off the mask. BUT IT CAN ALSO BE A WRONG ADVISE... YOU SEE BREATHING ALSO MEANS CAPACITY TO LIVE... 'STOP BREATHING THEN LIGHT WILL DISAPPEAR' - AN UNCONSCIOUS PART OF YOU IS TELLING YOU THAT WHEN YOU GET TOO INVOLVED IN SUCH NEGATIVE EXPERIMENTS THEN IT WILL BE AS IF THERE IS NO MORE WISDOM (DISAPPEARING LIGHT) AND DIFFICULTY FOR YOU TO FEEL ALIVE FROM WITHIN... ITS LIKE YOU CAN BECOME LIKE THE REST OF ARMY (TOO MECHANICAL AND RIGID) NOT APPLYING DISCERNMENT... Because I realize my distortions above so I tend to hide my needs, my intention in social level. A part of me know exactly how to transform that distortions (people give me tip), but just very small % (at that moment) The other man, who had been watching all the process, was quite stunned by everything that happened to me and the other two. Because, if I am gilded, it is a permanent transformation that I cannot change. Even though it's only on the outside, it's still my old mind and self on the inside. So, when I go out, I will be recognized as the army of this party and will be hated.DIFFICULTY TO ACCEPT THE AFOREMENTIONED DUALITIES IN YOU (DISCREPANCIES ON THE OUTSIDE AND INSIDE)... IT ALSO REFLECTS THAT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE IS CONFUSIONS I.E. ON ONE SIDE YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE SPECIAL POWER OF YOUR GILDED SELF AND ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU WANT TO SAVE OTHERS FROM THIS ARMY.... I also observe my memories triggered with surprise attitude, no help here, and couldn't help too, it likes I accept this memories and I don't try to escape or resist. YOU DID A GOOD EFFORT IN YOUR ANALYSIS NHU... ALSO READ OUR COMMENTS ABOVE TO COMPLETE... IT IS A DREAM TO HELP YOU TRANSFORM SPIRITUAL EXTREMISM IN YOU... AND BALANCE WELL YOUR RIGIDITY WITH A BEAUTIFUL TOLERANCE ALSO... WHILE KEEPING THE QUALITIES OF THE ARMY IN YOU, BEING WELL STRUCTURED AND ORGANIZED WITHOUT NEEDING TO SHINE... AND ALLOW YOURSELF BEAUTIFUL MOMENTS OF REPLENISHEMENT WHEN YOU TRULY DESERVE IT... SO AS TO BALANCE YOUR ENERGY IN A RIGHT WAY IN ALL SITUATIONS... WISHING YOU ANGELIC TRANSFORMATIONS AND DEEPER LEARNINGS SO THAT ONE DAY YOU ARE IN ACCEPTANCE OF YOUR OWN NATURAL RHYTHM OF EVOLUTION WITH ANGELS YELAHIAH & VEHUIAH ANGELIC BLESSINGS ALEXIS 19/08/2025, 15:48 Change appearance (again) | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/96134 3/4

title_pdf: Emotional dependency. last case id: C0229. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 13 May 2022 Angel: 11 Lauviah Dream and Analysis: Angelic Hello Professor ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU This week I chanted Angel 11 Lauviah with the intention: please help me understand my emotional dependency. OK, A BEAUTIFUL INITIATIVE... I only remember a small scene in the dream. My former colleagues [- represent old patterns, old knowledge and old memories AND ASPECTS RELATED TO YOUR AFFINITIES IN WORK, SOCIAL INTERACTIONS, CAPACITY TO HELP & SUPPORT ETC. ] in school uniforms [- represent the basic rules and disciplines in the process of forming internal structures, these disciplines are related to appearance. The minus is lack of discipline, basic rules; disregard for rules ALSO DEPICTS YOUR SOCIAL AURA (I.E. ON THE MINUS IT CAN MEAN NOTIONS OF BEING DRIVEN BY HOW OTHERS PERCIEVE YOU)... SCHOOL UNIFORM ON THE MINUS REPRESENTS TOO MUCH NEED TO BE PART OF THE GROUP, TO BE IDENTICAL TO OTHERS, WHICH COULD CREATE TOO MUCH SOCIAL IDENTIFICATION TO APPEARANCES... AND ALSO DIFFICULTIES TO LEARN, HAVING AN OUTWARD APPEARANCE ONLY, FOR LEARNING IN A %, LACK OF WISDOM, NAIVETY ETC. ] , we are at recess [- represents interaction at the social level, resting I.E. INTERMISSION AND HOW WELL ONE USES THIS TIME... IT CAN EITHER BE FOR CONTEMPLATION, BETTERMENT OF SELF OR IT CAN BE DRIVEN BY NEED BASED BEHAVIOUR ] on the school campus [- a place for students to have fun and interact on a social level. The minus point can be too much fun, lack of seriousness, discipline, disobedience IT IS ALSO A COLLECTIVE SYMBOL... SO YES INTERACTIONS, EXPERIENCES ETC. BUT REALTED TO THE SYMBOL OF SCHOOL THAT ON THE MINUS IS BLOCKAGES IN LEARNING, APPRENTICESHIP ETC. ] . Han [- represents a part of my femininity. For me, she is a person with a very high receptivity, good listening, analytical and reasoning ability, and intelligence. The minus point is lack of recognition, too much ambition ] came over and leaned on the edge of the table [- do not want to share, conservative ] next to me and we were talking. The dream showed my difficulties with emotional dependence stemming from old patterns when I interacted on a social level. I have related memories of disobeying any law, creating emotional outbursts. At the same time, on the social level, I am also a conservative, hard to share but I demand recognition from these people. This suppresses the emotions inside of me, keeping me constantly waiting to explode. However, it is dualistic, when I have emotions that are waiting to explode, I also have emotional deficits, creating a huge dependence on the social level. THE STARTING SCENE OF THE DREAM DEPICTS THE THEME... IN THIS DREAM YOU ARE CONNECTING WITH MEMORIES/ASPECTS THAT BLOCK OR IMPACT YOUR CAPACITY TO LEARN & CHANGE WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR AFFINITIES, SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS ETC. BECAUSE YOU COULD IDENTIFY TO THE GROUP TOO MUCH AT TIMES, WHEN YOU ARE IN THE SOCIAL... AND THIS COULD AFFECT YOUR WORK RELATIONSHIPS ALSO (SCHOOL UNIFORM + FORMER COLLEAGUES)... DUE TO THIS, SOMETIMES YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO CONTEMPLATE/REFLECT UPON YOURSELF, YOUR ACTIONS ETC. (USE OF INTERMISSION PERIOD) BECAUSE BEING PART OF THE GROUP BECOMES TOO IMPORTANT... LET US NOW SEE WHAT THOSE BLOCKAGES CAN BE IN LATTER PART OF THE DREAM I put my hand [- the way to give and receive, materialize the idea. The minus is difficult to give and receive, difficulty in materialize the idea ] on Han's shoulder [- represent responsibility. The minus point is putting too much responsibility of society, of others; taking responsibility too seriously ] ,I.E. A TENDENCY IN YOU TO SOMETIMES SHIFT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HAVING BALANCE IN YOUR RELATIONSHIPS, INTERACTIONS (GIVING AND RECEIVING) TO OTHERS... IT IS LIKE HOW SOMETIMES A PERSON DOES NOT CHANGE HIS/HER OWN WAYS OF CONNECTING/INTERACTING WITH OTHERS WHICH CAN SOMETIMES BE HURTFUL, WRONG ETC. BUT HE/SHE EXPECTS OTHERS (THEIR FRIENDS, FAMILY ETC.) TO ADJUST, ACCEPT AND UNDERSTAND THE WAY HE/SHE IS....THIS USUALLY HAPPENS WHEN ON DOES NOT APPLY LAW OF RESONANCE AND REFERS BACK TO SELF TO BECOME BETTER (EVEN IN THE WAY YOU ARE IN YOUR SOCIAL RELATIONS AND INTERACTIONS) looking at her jokingly. And then I purposely swayed THIS IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE... SO IN A WAY YOU ARE CONSCIOUS OR AWARE OF THIS ASPECT IN YOU BUT YOU DON'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY...A TENDENCY TO TRIVIALIZE AND BE TOO CASUAL ABOUT THE WAY YOU CONNECT WITH PEOPLE... ALSO GETTING PURPOSEFULLY HURT MEANS THAT SOMETIMES YOU CAN APPEAR LIKE A VICTIM SEEKING TOO MUCH ATTENTION, LOVE AND RECOGNITION IN YOUR INTERACTIONS...IT CAN SOMETIMES BE TOO MUCH THAT NOT ONLY IT CAN HURT YOU BUT IT CAN HURT OTHERS AS WELL... so that Han and I both fell [- represents the end, failure, and lesson. The minus point is the difficulty in understanding the lesson, difficulty in accepting failure, difficulty in starting over BUT HERE IT WAS DONE ON PURPOSE...NOTIONS OF TAKING RELATIONSHIPS FOR GRANTED, VICTIMHOOD IN ORDER TO SEEK SUPPORT AND ATTENTION, BEING A BIT SELF-CENTERED (NOT THINKING THAT OTHERS CAN GET HURT BY YOUR ACTIONS/BEHAVIOR ETC.)... ALSO IF YOU CONNECT WITH THE LAST DREAM YOU SUBMITTED... THEIR IS A SMALL PART OF YOU WHICH CAN SOMETIMES INVITE TROUBLE OR DIFFICULTIES TO FULFILL THE NEEDS OF ATTENTION, ACKNOWLEDGEMENT ETC... TO CONTEMPLATE ON THIS ASPECT DEAR NHU AND IT MEANS YOU COULD ALSO INFLUENCE OTHERS OR LET YOURSELF BEING INFLUENCED BY OTHERS TO BECOME MORE DOWN-TO-EARTH (FALLING)... LIKE FOR EXAMPLE LAUGHING AT ORDINARY JOKES, STARTING TO TEASE OTHERS, AS WE SEE OFTEN IN AN ORDINARY CONSCIOUSNESS... THIS IS WHY YOU ARE WEARING A UNIFORM HERE... SOMETIMES THE SOCIAL ENERGY OF THE GROUP BRINGS YOU TO A DOWN-TO-EARTH ATTITUDE TOO MUCH BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE PART OF THE GROUP... ] . Han recognized it and kept me from hitting the floor, while I was just trying to make us both fall. When I fell, I looked at Han and didn't see her happy, but only saw her a little annoyed, even though her hand still supported me. YES, A SUBTLE BUT IMPORTANT MESSAGE HERE DEAR NHU... SOMETIMES YOUR FRIENDS/COLLEAGUES CAN SENSE THE ABOVE TENDENCY IN YOU BUT THEY STILL SUPPORT YOU, HOWEVER THEY MAY NOT LIKE IT AND MIGHT NOT SUPPORT ANYMORE (IF THIS CONTINUES AND BECOMES TOO MUCH)... THIS IS ALSO A FORM OF DEPENDENCY... ALSO ANOTHER ASPECT IS THAT YOUR INNER HAN (YOUR EMOTIONS) IS NOW ABLE TO IDENTIFY THIS TRAIT IN YOU... BUT THEIR IS ANNOYANCE AND ANGER ABOUT THIS IN YOU... IT IS JUST LIKE WHEN WE JOKE BETWEEN FRIENDS OR COLLEAGUES... IT SEEMS FUNNY AND LIGHT IN THE APPEARANCE... BUT DEEP DOWN PEOPLE CAN BE HURT BY THE REMARKS THAT ARE DONE IN FRONT OF OTHERS... ESPECIALLY WITH HUMOR, WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL OF OUR ENERGY... NOT TU PUT OTHERS DOWN TOO MUCH, EVEN IF WE SAY OR DO SOMETHING JUST FOR FUN... IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE ELEVATING... AND IF SOMEONE MAKES A BAD JOKE TO US, WE CAN SIMPLY SMILE AND LOOK DOWN... AND IF IT IS TOO ANNOYING, WE CAN ALWAYS TALK ABOUT IT LATER ONE BY ONE... AND SAY GENTLY THAT THEIR JOKE WAS A LITTLE DISRESPECTFUL, WITH KINDNESS AND UNDERSTANDING... BECAUSE IF WE LET THIS HAPPEN TOO MUCH, ONE DAY WE MAY LOSE THE RESPECT OF THE OTHER PERSON, AS IT CAN NOURISH LITTLE POWER GAMES BEYOND... I have the wrong attitude toward socially relevant jobs, jobs that require accountability and realism. Therefore, make up lessons, and fail myself, because my attitude (jokingly, swayed to fall) is not right. And it continued to make it difficult for me to recognize the lessons I needed to learn, improve, revise, and start over. YES WELL DISCERNED... BUT THE PROCESS OF LEARNING AND INTERACTING WITH OTHERS SHOULD WITH EMOTIONS OF LOVE, COMPASSION AND PATIENCE AND NOT WITH ANNOYANCE... WE CAN ALWAYS LAUGH AND HAVE A GOOD TIME TOGETHER, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CREATE A BEAUTIFUL GROUP DYNAMIC... BUT BY TRANSFORMING FIRST THE DOWN-TO-EARTH ENERGY, SO THAT OUR PRESENCE ALWAYS SUPPORTS OTHERS INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM DOWN... We both helped each other up. And I looked at Han bewildered, she looked at me a bit annoyed and disappointed. Then she left. I realized my jokes didn't make her happy, everyone was surprised too. YES... SO IT IS LIKE A WARNING TO YOU TO WORK ON THESE PERCENTAGES OF DEPENDENCIES... EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCY CAN SOMETIMES MAKE A PERSON TOO FOCUSSED ON OWN NEEDS AND FEELINGS/SENSATIONS ETC. NOT REALLY CARING FOR OTHERS AND START TO MAKE JOKES WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT THEIR CONSEQUENCES... THIS CAN ALSO CAUSE YOUR FRIENDS, WELL WISHERS TO SOMETIMES CREATE A DISTANCE DUE TO THESE DISTURBANCES... AND WITH THIS DREAM, YOU COULD ALSO ATTRACT THIS % BY RESONANCE FROM COLLEAGUES OR FRIENDS... This dream shows that I have a great lack of emotions inside, so I tend to play around, seek out emotions with a humorous but extremely childish attitude, to make up for the emotional part that is lacking deficit AND TO BE PART OF THE GROUP, FEEL LIKE YOU BELONG... BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THIS IN ORDER TO BE RESPECTED AND APPRECIATED BY OTHERS... AND THIS IS THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES... YOU ARE INVITED TO TRANSCEND THIS % SO THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS FEEL PART OF THE GROUP, WITHOUT NEEDING IT AT THE SAME TIME... AND KEEP YOUR BEAUTIFUL SPIRITUAL INTENTION AND PRESENCE IN ALL YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHERS :). Old patterns of society in my mind have created this dependence. WELL UNDERSTOOD THE ESSENCE DEAR NHU ... ALSO PLEASE REFER TO THE COMMENTS ABOVE During my time working with Angel 11 Lauviah, I asked my boss for help with my work difficulties. And the boss has instilled in me a new working mindset, towards the core values ​of the team, how to work with rights and empower others. During the listening process, I was surprised that my 19/08/2025, 15:48 Emotional dependency | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/96634 2/3 boss was not a religious person, but he realized the truths that only seemed to be understood by the great teachings, as well as did not study the parties teaching about spiritual science studies such as UCM, where the boss can recognize definitions, truths and can apply practically to the job. I also exchanged with my boss about some of the knowledge I learned in DSSI. WONDERFUL... UCM AND DSSI VALUES ARE UNIVERSAL AND IT IS GOOD THAT YOU COULD SHARE ABOUT IT... After that, I had a 3-day tour with some friends in the company, at the end of the trip, I was exhausted. I realized that partly because I talked deeply, a lot with a sister in the company to help her understand the new thinking of the company, as well as answer questions and problems she encountered in life (similar to before I was exhausted after talking to 1 friend). I identify the points of resonance between me and her: like to interfere in other people's affairs, impose opinions, be stubborn, talk a lot... And she is being pointed out these minus points of herself, she is very positive. Because I was exhausted from the trip, I couldn't go back with everyone, I stayed and went back to my house (my house is near the place where we go on the trip) to rest for 3 days and then came back again. When I was at home, I went to the doctor and was told that I had allergic rhinitis (a disease related to the nose, about the way I absorb and purify my thoughts recently, and also the way to get oxygen to the brain (positive thoughts)). When I came back today, I continued to make an appointment with another female leader in the company to talk about the new idea. I accidentally met an old colleague at that cafe shop. And we talked for a while about the things she changed. She said that a lot of negative things happened to her, but she temporarily stopped by preventing everything from reaching her, she stopped using social media for a while to give herself a comfortable enough space to deal with the negative thoughts inside. This reminds me of myself 3 years ago, I am also a person who has been isolated from society for a few months, to have enough space for myself to go inside, to understand myself better, and to gradually become self-sufficient. solve internal problems. My story this week has so many symbols number "3", which means I'm working with my inner structure which is related to my emotional dependency. YES IT IS WONDERFUL TO SEE THAT YOU ARE LEARNING TO APPLY THE KNOWLEDGE AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THINGS SYMBOLICALLY IN YOUR DAILY LIFE... SINCE YOU WERE RECEPTIVE AND OPEN YOU WERE ABLE TO EXPRESS AND SEEK HELP FROM YOUR INNER BOSS. HOWEVER IN TERMS OF YOUR SOCIAL INTERACTIONS, DISCUSSIONS ETC... YOU CAN SOMETIMES HAVE EXTREMES IN YOU I.E. EITHER YOU GET TOO INTERFERING OR IMPOSING ON OTHER PEOPLE'S AFFAIRS OR YOU CAN COMPLETELY ISOLATE AND DISCONNECT YOURSELF....SO YOU SEE IT HAS NOT BEEN TRANSFORMED YET AND YOUR HIDDEN NEEDS CAN MAKE YOU EXPERIENCE THESE DUALITIES... AS CAN ALSO BE SEEN THROUGH YOUR ILLNESS (ALERGIC RHINITIS)... NOSE IS RELATED TO YOUR LOWER CHAKRAS (I.E. NEEDS, INSTINCTUAL ASPECTS ETC.) AND AS YOU HAVE RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD IT IS RELATED TO THOUGHTS...YOUR INNER POLLENS, DUST ETC. (NEGATIVE ASPECTS) CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT YOUR CAPACITY TO DISCERN, THINK IN THE RIGHT WAY.... THIS CAN ALSO LIMIT YOUR ABILITY TO PURIFY YOUR THOUGHTS... WHILE IT IS AMAZING THAT YOU ARE UNDERSTANDING ASPECTS ABOUT YOU THROUGH THIS ILLNESS BUT IT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT, IF NECESSARY, TO CONTINUE TAKING TIMELY MEDICAL HELP AND TO HAVE GOOD HEALTH DEAR NHU... WE WISH FOR ANGELIC PURIFICATION AND TRANSFORMATION IN THE WAY YOU BUILD YOUR RELATIONSHIPS AND CONNECTS WITH OTHERS, BEING MORE CENTERED ON QUALITIES INSTEAD OF NEEDS WITH ANGELS IEIAZEL AND VEHUEL ANGELIC BLESSINGS ALEXIS

PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 24 February 2023 Angel: 40 Ieiazel 68 Habuhiah Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello teachers, ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU, My intention: please help me understand the difficulties that I have in my current job. THIS IS A WONDERFUL INTENTION... I & a man [- a part of my masculine polarity represent a certain % of my action world. He seems to be my lover, I feel the stability of this man, I trust and feel him be able to protect me. Here I don't recognize many negative points of this man, showing that I have too much dependence and trust in him (the way I am acting in my current life and work). This shows that I lack of awareness when working and living, self-protect too much, and lack of the right action to express myself more. I'm not even sure if this man is my lover or not, showing the unconsciousness of my current actions YES, WELL ANALYSED DEAR NHU. ALSO, THIS MAN THAT REPRESENTS YOUR ACTION WORLD IN THE DREAM SHOWS YOU THE BLOCKAGES WHERE THERE IS AN IMBALANCE IN BEING RECEPTIVE AND BEING EMISSIVE... ] are running away [- is a manifestation of the inferiority complex. I may be scared, afraid to express myself because of a lack of confidence or fear of getting hurt, or fear that I will hurt others RUNNING AWAY FROM SOMETHING REPRESENTS MEMORIES OF FLEEING/ESCAPISM FROM RESPONSIBILITIES AND ALSO FROM NEGATIVE MEMORIES... ] from something. The opening of the dream shows that I tend to avoid emitting myself at work. Because I have an inferiority complex, over-dependence, overprotection from what I consider to be bad in this environment. I lack awareness of the way I act. WELL UNDERSTOOD... IN A DEEPER LEVEL, IT SHOWS THAT YOU CAN HAVE DIFFICULTIES FACING CERTAIN MEMORIES THAT CAN DISTURB YOU... ONE DAY, YOU WILL NOT FLEE NEGATIVITY, YOU WILL HAVE AN OPEN HEART READY TO TRANSFORM STONES INTO PRECIOUS GEMS... In real life, most of the people currently working in my company, including the Founder, are building the company & its activities the way they built the multi-level model before, so I feel there is a lot of coercion, lack of core values for society, lack of love & empathy for all people and investors. They are too attached to material things, their financial needs are too high, which makes them even very confident in what I think might be deceiving others, & they do so unconsciously without realizing it. YOU HAVE A PROFOUND DISCERNMENT, NHU... AND ONE DAY, THEIR SOULS WILL BE READY TO CLEANSE THEIR EXCESSIVE MATERIALISTIC NEEDS... THOUGH IT SEEMS UNCONSCIOUS, THESE ARE MEMORIES WHERE THERE ARE MANY UNMET MATERIAL NEEDS, SEEKING ACKNOWLEDGMENT, ETC. I also noticed that they have a lot of superiority & inferiority complex inside them, leading to them being jealous, comparing, judging outside and even within the company. They flatter their boss. GOOD OBSERVATION... IF YOU WISH YOU CAN ALSO ANALYZE THEIR PLUSES SO YOU WILL DEVELOP COMPASSION FOR THOSE PARTS OF YOU Many people in the company also have memories of infidelity. INFIDELITY IS RELATED TO A DEEP LACK OF LOVE AND THUS THE NEED TO MULTIPLY "LOVE" RELATIONSHIPS... From the beginning, even when I became more & more aware of these things, I actually avoided private conversations, or out-of-work outings as much as possible. For the rest of the work, I always try to complete my best. However, perhaps I was supposed to not blend in with the environment. Everyone when working in the company at a management level or higher (I belong to this level) is required that: trust and commit to accompany the company to the end. OK. IT IS ALSO OK TO BRING A BALANCE WITHIN YOURSELF FIRST...TRUST AND COMMITMENT CANNOT BE FORCED, IT COMES FIRST FROM WITHIN... OF COURSE, TRUST AND COMMITMENT ARE BEAUTIFUL AND WONDERFUL QUALITIES WHEN IT IS DEVELOPED WITH THE RIGHT INTENTION... OTHERWISE, COMMITMENT CAN BECOME LIKE A BURDEN AND ULTIMATELY LIKE A PRISON WHEN PEOPLE FORCED THEMSELVES... Inside me, I really didn't believe that this company with this approach would succeed. But I still respect people & their ways, it just doesn't work for me. And actually, my intention in doing this is this: I hope to be able to transform the related karmic consequences of materialism, the complex of superiority & inferiority. I'm hoping to get out of this job quickly. OK AND KEEP WORKING ON YOUR MEMORIES WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY FINDING AN APPROPRIATE JOB/WORK... We ran to a very large ground, completely covered with a layer of green grass [- represent a part of my world of action & emotions. The green grass shows how I express my actions to the outside world: bringing freshness, youth, receptivity, listening, but hidden deep inside (ground) are many distortions that have not been properly expressed EXCELLENT UNDERSTANDING... ] . In the middle of the ground, there is a very square dug pit [- represent the organizational structure OF YOUR EMOTIONAL WORLD AND A PIT HERE ALSO INDICATES TO GO WITHIN AT DEEPER LEVEL TO THE ROOT CAUSE. Currently, I sometimes seem overly structured, rigid, or lack of structure, properly organized in the way I act. The pit represents a lack that needs to be compensated or lack of a solid foundation from within on which to build the right action way YES, WELL UNDERSTOOD... IT SHOWS ALSO THE UNCONSCIOUS LEVEL BECAUSE IT IS UNDER THE LEVEL OF THE GROUND... ] . There is a wooden bed without mattress [- represents the DIFFICULTY IN nourishment of renewable energy WITHIN. The wooden bed shows that I am still feeding myself with poverty, lack, rigidity, rudiment, lack of love ,PERSONAL INTIMACY (mattress) ] in the pit. In my current job and life, I am showing outward beauty, vitality, goodness (green grass), but I am covering up inner distortions because of the lack of organizational structure, nourished & created by my own material needs but from poverty, too rigid, lack of love & tolerance. I am taking the beauty on the outside to compensate for the inner lack, without really understanding to transform my problem. So maybe the Universe arranged for me to enter this environment so that I need to learn it more deeply. YES, WELL UNDERSTOOD YOU HAVE A PROFOUND ANSWER REGARDING YOUR QUESTION... YOU SEE ALSO THE DEEP UNCONSCIOUS NEED TO REST AS WELL AS THE EXCESSIVE NEED OF LIVING AN EXPANSION OF YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS (LARGE GROUND)... AS IF THE MEMORIES RELATED TO WORK CAN MAKE YOU FEEL LIMITED, NOT YOURSELF COMPLETELY... THUS, YOU ARE FLEEING THOSE MEMORIES AS SEEN IN THE FIRST SCENE... The man said we would stay here. Then, we made love [- represent the DIFFICULTY IN YOUR INNER COUPLE THAT BLOCKS divine union between the OF YOUR INNER couple THUS CREATING DIFFICULTIES IN MARRYING SPIRIT AND MATTER, also the karmic union of the 2 polarities. This man represents my unconscious acting in my current work environment (probably because the energy from my colleagues and the environment triggered these memories). Therefore, the act of making love shows that I am continuing to nurture and make these acts a deeper part of who I am VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD... AND IT SHOWS ALSO THE NOTION OF COMPENSATION FOR THE MEMORIES OF AFFECTIVE EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES ] and rested in bed. After that, we talked about work & life, maybe he & I were working together THIS ALSO INDICATES DIFFICULTIES WITH CONSOLATION FROM WITHIN... AND YOU SEE THAT THERE IS NO MATTRESS... A LACK OF INTIMACY ALSO, A LACK OF STRUCTURE... SO THIS DREAM IS ALSO TELLING YOU THAT YOU CAN GO TOO FAST IN A LOVE RELATIONSHIP IF YOU FEEL GOOD AND PROTECTED BY A MAN... ( AS YOU HAVE DESCRIBED THIS MAN AS PROTECTIVE, STABLE AND GOOD AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DREAM ) 23/07/2025, 12:03 A man | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/106227 2/3 Within these situations & distortions, I still seek rest and harmony from this work. Maybe because I think that this is also the best way for me to understand karma and transformation. I really think that I need to talk and communicate with people in the company more, instead of avoiding to be able to understand the lessons I need to learn better & more deeply. WONDERFUL REALIZATION DEAR NHU... AND UNDERSTANDING THIS DREAM WILL HELP YOU NOT TO FLEE YOUR MEMORIES... That morning when I woke up, I felt very tired & exhausted. The night before, I went to join the AMM session about Habuhiah Angel in UCM Vietnam office. AN IMPORTANT AND VERY INTERESTING SIGN DEAR INITIATE AS ANGEL HABUHIAH FACILITATES HEALING BY UNDERSTANDING THE ROOT CAUSE, BUT THE MEMORIES OF FLEEING/ESCAPING CREATE DIFFICULTIES INSIDE. My inner struggle created external exhaustion, which through individual meditation, meditation with others, increased the activation of memories, making this struggle fatigue manifest in my physical body AND THUS FURTHER CREATING DIFFICULTIES TO REGAIN BALANCE. I had a question or an intention when I was working with Angels, but in the process of meditating, I started to ask guiding questions for myself, then I realized my intention has changed. When working with Angel Ieiazel, during my meditation, I have many questions such as: in this environment, what karma do I need to work with, is it material or not, I need how to understand it... This right or wrong? How should I determine my intention/question is the best to be able to understand the dream answered to that question the best? DEAR NHU, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE AN ANSWER, IT IS GOOD TO CONCENTRATE TO ONE QUESTION AT A TIME... PROGRESSIVELY THE ANSWERS WILL BE UNVEILED... AND BY BEING DETACHED YET RESPONSIBLE AT THE SAME TIME, YOU CAN ALSO REPEAT THE DIVINE LAW - 'MATTER IS TEMPORAL AND EDUCATIONAL' LIKE A MANTRA, MEDITATE ON IT AND WHATEVER SIGNS AND DREAMS ARE RECEIVED THEY WILL GUIDE YOU. ALSO, REMEMBER THAT EVERY DREAM BRINGS WITH IT PROFOUND INFORMATION THAT IS THE BEST GUIDANCE SYSTEM FROM UP ABOVE... YOU HAVE REALLY WELL UNDERSTOOD YOUR DREAM AND MADE A PROFOUND CONNECTION WITH THE CONCRETE REALITY... 100 % DECODING DEAR NHU... WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE YOUR GREAT EFFORTS ANGELIC THOUGHTS WITH MIHAEL, MENADEL AND HABUHIAH ... ÂN

title_pdf: 03 Dream - The butt torn pant [2023]. last case id: C0231. PDF text: Dream date: Saturday, 4 March 2023 Angel: 40 Ieiazel Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello teachers ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU I chanted Angel Ieiazel with the intention: Please send consolation to them and the people around me WONDERFUL INTENTION In the reality, during the 2nd day of the Angel Ieiazel Seminar, my neighbor's family in my hometown had a murder. Because of the conflict with his wife, the husband killed his wife and sister-in-law, and he makes seriously injured his wife's parents, endangering their life. Luckily, he didn't run away, so the police were able to arrest him on the spot. This made people in my hometown town quite nervous. My parents are also quite sad because that family has been our neighbor for many years, so I want to send a wish to the Universe to send them the energy of consolation. AND WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS, IT CORRESPOND TO AN IMMENSE ACCUMULATION OF NEGATIVE MEMORIES THAT HE HAS RECORDED FOR YEARS AND YEARS... UNTIL HE CANNOT REPRESS ANYMORE... FOR SURE, THIS MOMENT IN TIME WILL DEFINITIVELY MARK THE CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE UNCONSCIOUSNESS OF EVERYONE IN THE HOMETOWN... AT THAT MOMENT, INDEED, WE CAN BE WITH THEM IN OUR PRAYER... And about a week later I received this dream. I and some people from Board of Directors, shareholders, and company partners [- a part of my masculine polarity, action world (most people are male), lack of empathy, high ego, self-centered, lack of love, superficiality, superiority and inferiority complex, need to recognition AND THESE DISTORTED MEMORIES CREATES DIFFICULTIES TO INTERIORIZE ] are in a room. The room is built of brick and mortar that is not painted [- DIFFICULTIES RELATED TO built structure, organization at the social level, lack of certainty, lack of confidence, lack of commitment, lack of overview, lack of ability to express ALSO THESE MEMORIES ARE OLD/ANCIENT AS IT'S NOT PAINTED YET AND NO PAINT CAN BE RELATED TO A LACK OF WARM, LACK OF CREATIVITY WHEN YOU ARE IN A DYNAMIC OF WORK... ] . Everyone is in a meeting. AND THE MEETING REPRESENTS THE NOTION OF CONNECTION WITH MANY PARTS OF YOU WHO ARE IN A POSITION OF DECISION, OF POWER ( IN THIS CASE, WITH BOD, SHAREHOLDER, ETC. ) On a social level, in my current job, I lack the right representation (masculine polarity). Derived from my lack of ability to structure, and communicate within myself. WELL PERCEIVED... THIS FIRST SCENE IS HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO DEVELOP SUCH AS LOVE, CREATIVITY, AND COLORS IN THE WAY YOU ARE MAKING DECISIONS, WORKING WITH OTHERS, AND CONNECTING POSITIVELY WITH OTHERS... After that, everyone rests. Some people rest on the sofa, myself included. From the other side of the sofa, Uyen [- fragile, lacks inner security, too soft, self-deprecating, has material karma. She used to suffer from depression because she lacked inner happiness, while she was not lacking of material SO HERE YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFICULTIES IN YOUR INNER/EMOTIONAL WORLD ] is crawling on the sofa's backrest [- moving forward of children, this is the stepping stone before the baby can walk, having difficulty moving forward. Here, she is crawling on the sofa's backrest, this is a childish act in a space with many people, showing that my inner Uyen has the energy to play and have fun while working. She crawls towards me means wanting to connect with myself AND IT CAN ALSO BE BECAUSE THE PANTS WERE TORN, SO MEMORIES OF BEING JUDGED, LACK OF RECEPTIVITY, AND IMBALANCE IN THE ACTION WORLD BECAUSE IT'S NOT NORMAL TO WEAR SUCH PANTS AS THEY AREN'T FORMAL AND INDICATES A CASUAL BEHAVIOR IN THE ACTION WORLD WHICH LACKS RECEPTIVITY AND PROFOUNDNESS ] to this side to say something to me. AND FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE ESSENCE OF THIS SCENE, YOU SEE THAT PROBLEMS START WHEN YOU LACK LOVE, AND WARMTH IN YOUR STRUCTURE OF WORK (NO PAINTING, BRICK AND MORTAR), AND IT STARTS ALSO WHEN YOU WANT TO REST, TO TAKE A MOMENT TO RENEW YOUR ENERGY... THIS SCENE MEANS THAT SOMETIMES YOU DON'T WANT THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (MOVING FORWARD LIKE A CHILD) AS YOU ARE IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR INNER UYEN... SOMETIMES HAVING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF MATTER CAN MAKE YOU FRAGILE, INSECURE BECAUSE OF THE EVENTUAL NEGATIVE KARMA THAT YOU MIGHT ENGENDER... OF COURSE, IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... I turn around and see that Uyen's butt pants were torn [- pant represents the protection of the human ability to move forward, the butt represents the ability to support myself (the body) when I am in a receptive state (sitting). The minus is I lack the ability to protect and support myself in my ability to move forward, on the other hand, I can sometimes brag about my inner abilities AND MAINLY THE TORN ASPECT OF THE PANTS IS ABOUT BEING TIRED OF HAVING RESPONSIBILITIES, OF MAKING DECISIONS, TIRED OF MOVING FORWARD IN LIFE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF LOVE WHEN YOU WORK WITHIN YOURSELF... IT IS SUCH A BLESSING TO RECEIVE THIS KIND OF DREAM... ONCE TRANSFORMED, YOUR CAPACITY TO WORK WITH TRULY CHANGE... WHEN YOU HAVE LOVE AND WISDOM, NO WORK BECOMES A BURDEN... BECAUSE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE QUALITIES THAT YOU ARE BUILDING WITHIN YOU... ] and there is a metal ring sticking out [- represents DIFFICULTIES RELATED TO solidity, connectivity, establishing structure; fragile, lack of ability to build structure and organization at work, in society, lack of ability to connect in community. Here, the metal ring at the butt, and the inside of Uyen's pants, represent my DIFFICULTY inability to establish a solid, secure, structure for my ability to move forward, my inner Uyen tends to hide this IT IS ALSO THE NOTION OF CONCENTRATION, AND METAL IS ABOUT COLDNESS ALSO... SO YOU SEE A CONCENTRATION OF COLDNESS... IT IS A CLUE FROM THE UNIVERSE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE IN YOUR LIFE, YOU CAN BE AFFECTED BY COLDNESS WHILE ADVANCING (LEGS) AND WORKING ON YOURSELF... ] , it seems a bit big. I tell Uyen and she panics a bit. Perhaps some people also see and murmur something. Inside me, I have some joking attitudes, the desire to hide and not show properly in the current working environment. And people at work have noticed and some have talked something about me, and I know this too. AND IT CAN BE SAID THAT SPEAKING ON THE BACK OF OTHERS IS A HUMAN HABIT... THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOMEONE TALKING ON THE BACK OF SOMEONE ELSE... SO THE MOST IMPORTANT IS TO CONTINUE TO DO OUR BEST... WHATEVER PEOPLE WILL THINK ABOUT US... Then, I don't look at Uyen anymore, I turn around to see if anyone sees or says anything about her. THIS PART INDICATES THE MEMORIES OF AVOIDING AND ESCAPISM BUT MAINLY THE FEAR OF BEING JUDGED... YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE SEE THE CONCENTRATION OF COLDNESS... THE LACK OF LOVE... Uyen panics for a while and crawls back to her own place, then, Uyen put on a red long coat [- lack of inner security, tend to show too much on the outside, and tend to hide, self-centered, superiority and inferiority complex, seeks recognition AND ALSO RED LONG COAT REPRESENTS MEMORIES THAT ARE TOO EMISSIVE IN FULFILLING THE BASIC NEEDS ] to cover the torn part and follows Van [- tends to please others, need for materials, too secure ] out. I am a bit surprised because they are both wearing red long outerwear, but the style is slightly different. SOMETIMES, YOU WOULD LIKE TO HIDE THE TORN ASPECT IN YOUR ADVANCEMENT, THE ENERGY AND THE PERCENTAGE OF DEPRESSION, THE TIREDNESS, BECAUSE OF WANTING TO SHOW THAT EVERYTHING IS FINE... AND AT THAT MOMENT, YOU CAN FOCUS EVEN MORE ON MATTER (RED) ON THE RELATIONAL LEVEL, IN ORDER NOT TO THINK ABOUT THE CONCENTRATION OF COLDNESS, THE TIREDNESS... IT IS A PROFOUND MECHANISM THAT YOU ARE DISCOVERING HERE... The space is still quite quiet, but I can hear some people laughing and talking about Uyen's problem. Then the CEO asks what was wrong, I quickly says: there is nothing, boss. SO HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT WHEN YOUR INNER AUTHORITY IS ACTIVATED, YOU SOMETIMES TEND TO REMAIN AT THE SUPERFICIAL LEVEL AND NOT DEEP ENOUGH... AND REMEMBER, IT IS ALSO YOU THE PEOPLE THAT ARE LAUGHING... BUT AS A SPIRITUAL PERSON, OF COURSE, YOU WILL NOT LAUGH AT THE PROBLEMS OF OTHERS... BUT YOU CAN EVENTUALLY BE AFFECTED BY PEOPLE WHO DISPLAY THAT MOCKERY BEHAVIOR AS PER THE LAW OF RESONANCE... THIS DREAM IS HELPING YOU TO FACE THE MEMORIES OF COLDNESS AND THE LACK OF LOVE, DEAR NHU... I have heard before that having material karma will manifest as superficial. Please help me to understand this, I find this expression very correct but I don't know why. DEAR NHU, ANY KARMA HAS ITS CAUSE AND CONSEQUENCE BOTH. MATTER CAN APPEAR TO BE SUPERFICIAL WHEN ONE LACKS THE SPIRITUAL SIDE OR IS NOT ABLE TO SEE THE SPIRITUAL SIDE OF MATTER WHICH IS CRUCIAL IN MARRYING THE SPIRIT AND MATTER. EVERYTHING STARTS AT THE METAPHYSICAL LEVEL FIRST AND ACCUMULATES OVER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME TO MANIFEST OR MATERIALIZE 23/07/2025, 12:04 The butt torn pant | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/106649 2/3 OUTSIDE. IF YOU ARE ABLE TO RELATE IT THEN THIS MEANS APPLYING THE LAW OF RESONANCE FIRST AND THEN ALSO MAKING AN EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND THE DIVINE LAW OF KARMA - ONE REAPS WHAT ONE SOW AND MATTER IS TEMPORAL AND EDUCATIONAL... YOU SEE THAT THE DREAM IS NOT TOTALLY LINKED WITH THE EVENT THAT YOU HAVE LIVED... BUT IT HAS AWAKENED CERTAIN RESONANCE AND IT WILL HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE CAN ACCUMULATE MANY NEGATIVE MEMORIES OVER TIME SUCH AS THE LACK OF LOVE, FRUSTRATIONS, ANGER, INSECURITIES, FEAR, GREED, ETC. AND EVENTUALLY, OVER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME, ANGER, TIREDNESS, DEEP LACK OF LOVE AND FRUSTRATION ARE SO BIG THAT PEOPLE CAN COMMIT VIOLENCE... Angelic thank you ANGELIC DEVELOPMENT AND CONNECTION WITHLOVE WITHIN YOU WHILE YOU ARE WORKING ON YOURSELF WITH GENTLENESS AND WISDOM WITH IEIAZEL & MENADEL ÂN

Inside me, I have some joking attitudes, the desire to hide and not show properly in the current working environment. And people at work have noticed and some have talked something about me, and I know this too. Uyen panics for a while and crawls back to her own place, then, Uyen put on a red long coat to cover the torn part and follows Van out. I am a bit surprised because they are both wearing red long outerwear, but the style is slightly different. The space is still quite quiet, but I can hear some people laughing and talking about Uyen's problem. Then the CEO asks what was wrong, I quickly says: there is nothing, boss.",

title_pdf: 04 Dream - Childhood friend [2023]. last case id: C0232. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 10 March 2023 Angel: 53 Nanael Dream mood: surprise Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello teachers ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU My intention: please help me transform my ability to communicate with people around me. MAYBE YOU CAN USE THE WORD "IMPROVE" INSTEAD OF "TRANSFORM" Everyone participated in a training program [- represent the receptivity and supplement of knowledge at the SOCIAL collective level; the ability to act, express and communicate in a collective SOCIAL environment (physical training, teamwork sessions). Communication difficulties may come from the lack of ability to listen and respond properly, at the collective level, I have an imbalance between receptivity and emissivity because perhaps I have a tendency to tend to be too intellectual, too theoretical, so forming inherent judgments, blocking outward expression because I have thought about it in my mind in advance and analyzed too much, preventing myself from experience through action WELL ANALYZED, ALSO COMMUNICATION IS JUST NOT LIMITED TO THE OUTSIDE, IT'S ALSO A PROFOUND CONVERSATION WITHIN, WHAT YOU THINK, SPEAK TO YOURSELF REGARDING VARIOUS ASPECTS AND SITUATIONS ] in the deep forest [- I'm going into the world of feelings and emotion in depth YES, AND THE DEEP MEMORIES WHERE SOMETIMES DOMINANCE, SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST KIND OF MEMORIES ARE SHOWING YOU THE DIFFICULTIES YOU EXPERIENCE WHILE COMMUNICATING WITH SELF AND OTHERS ] . AS THE DEEP FOREST IS ALSO A MIXED WITH THE VEGETABLE AND ANIMALS KINGDOM AND THERE ARE MANY UNKNOWN MOVEMENTS INSIDE OF A DEEP FOREST, YOU ARE SHOWN UNCONSCIOUS INSTINCTUAL NEEDS, UNCONSCIOUS FEELINGS WITHIN YOU... AND THE TRAINING PROGRAM IN THIS DREAM IS MAINLY A TRAINING FOR YOUR SOUL... TO BECOME BETTER WHILE YOU ARE DISCOVERING YOUR UNCONSCIOUSNESS... IT IS ALSO THE NOTION OF EXPLORING YOUR INTENTION WHILE YOU ARE TRAINING YOURSELF TO BECOME BETTER... The dream is taking me into the memories of when I was in high school, I went to a boarding school, and was raised and taught in rigidity, excessive discipline, lack of love between teachers, managers and student, lack of empathy. Resonating with my low self-esteem, in this environment I only communicate with a few close friends, because I can't communicate with many strange friends, so most of the time, I keep quiet, and gradually build a cover to protect one's own feelings. IT IS WELL CONNECTED... ON ONE HAND, STAYING IN BOARDING SCHOOL IS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCIPLINE ONESELF, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE RIGID ENVIRONMENT CAN SOMETIMES CREATE DIFFICULTY TO EXPRESS SELF IN A MORE AUTHENTIC WAY BY ACKNOWLEDGING YOUR OWN TRUE FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS. SO APPLYING THE LAW OF RESONANCE HERE CAN HELP FURTHER TO CREATE A BALANCE BETWEEN DISCIPLINE AND EXPRESSING YOURSELF... DISCIPLINE IS A WONDERFUL QUALITY DEAR NHU, BUT IT SHOULDN'T CREATE RIGIDITY,... After running together [- represents how I am moving forward in society with the group (colleagues) with a faster intention and way of acting, on the negative side can cause comparison, winning or losing COMPETITION mindset created by a high ego, inferiority and superiority complex, self-centered SEEKING ACKNOWLEDGMENT. RUNNING WITH SUCH INTENTIONS CAN ALSO IMPACT YOUR HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHERS AND SELF THEREBY CAUSING AN IMBALANCE IN THE COMMUNICATION. ] in the evening, everyone returned to the room to rest DIFFICULTY IN INTERIORIZATION, AND SELF-REFLECTION. In the room, there are several 5-bunk beds [- represents support, re-energizing, and nurturing personal intimacy. Bunk beds are often used in boarding schools or the military, representing the focus on training, nurturing yourself faster, more disciplined, tougher. Distortion of Angel 5 Mahasiah is difficulty in rectifying, repairing, acknowledging and regretting mistakes or forgiving the mistakes of others. The 5-bunk bed represents that I have had memories of nurturing myself with harshness, excessive discipline, imposition, and hatred with a tendency to revenge, so it makes it difficult for me to admit fault, correct mistakes YOU HAVE A PROFOUND HUMILITY DEAR NHU... AND WHEN YOU ANALYZE YOURSELF, REMEMBER ALSO TO DO IT WITH LOVE AND COMPASSION FOR YOUR OWN SOUL... ] . ANGEL MAHASIAH ALSO HELPS TO UNDERSTAND THAT LIFE IS A REAL SCHOOL AND PROVIDES A CAPACITY TO RECTIFY WHAT IS GROWING WRONG BEFORE IT MATERIALIZES. SO YOU NEED TO BALANCE YOUR ANALYSIS WITH A BALANCED POINT OF VIEW ALSO DEAR INITIATE AS THE DISTORTED MEMORIES OF THE DREAM REPRESENT A % BUT YOU ALSO HAVE MANY WONDERFUL QUALITIES AND POTENTIAL TO LEARN FROM THE MISTAKES. . The distance between the floors is uneven = DIFFICULTY MATERIALIZING WELL, TO BE STABLE IN MATTER... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE..., with a very narrow floor just enough for people to lie down on, and a wide floor, enough for people to sit . I wonder how people can go in to lie on that narrow floor. Each floor is for 2 AND 2 HERE REPRESENT THE DIFFICULTIES IN RELATIONSHIPS AND COMMUNICATION WITH people. AND HERE YOU ARE BEEN TESTED WITH THE LACK OF INTIMACY... YOU CAN SEE YOUR DEEP INTENTION WHEN YOU WANT TO IMPROVE CERTAIN QUALITIES IN YOU... IN A SUBTLE WAY, IT SHOWS THAT YOU NEED THE PRESENCE OF PEOPLE WHILE YOU ARE TRAINING AND IMPROVING YOURSELF BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT CREATES A LACK OF INTIMACY AND IT WILL CREATE A DIFFICULTY FOR YOU TO RENEW YOUR ENERGY, TO REST PROPERLY... BECAUSE OF TOO MUCH OF SOCIAL... THIS DREAM IS ALSO TELLING YOU TO BALANCE WELL YOUR INTIMACY AND THE SOCIAL LEVEL... . In the high school environment, I was shown to have an energy of competition, comparison. In reality, students would be placed in the middle by grades. The higher the grades, the more appreciated they were. And this is also my resonance in the current work environment, where I am respected by everyone because I have more expertise and experience than anyone else, and this is what people do and express to me, even though I didn't ask for this, even I said many times in front of people that I wasn't that much good. During this period, I also had periods of forming hatred toward myself, friends, and family, because I felt left out BECAUSE OF THE MEMORIES OF COMPETITION, LACK OF SELF- ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, LACK OF SELF-LOVE THAT AFFECTS YOUR COMMUNICATION WITH SELF AND OTHERS. Around me only friends and strangers, no one familiar, even though it's me that wants to study here because I want to live far from my family THIS ALSO SHOWS A LACK OF UNERSTANDING RELATED TO FAMILY DYNAMICS, SUPPRESSED EMOTIONS AND THEIR EXPRESSION AS THE FAMILY IS THE FIRST PLACE WHERE A PERSON LEARNS TO COMMUNICATE.. It shows that I am also very fragile inside, and lack understanding for myself and my family, lack of understanding of this experience as an adolescent. IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE DEAR NHU... THIS METAPHYSICAL TRAINING WILL STRENGTHEN YOU TO BECOME MORE STABLE IN YOUR LIFE, IN THE WAY YOU ARE MAKING EFFORTS ALSO WHILE YOU BALANCE YOUR SOCIAL LIFE... I saw Phuong [- a part of my feminine polarity, imbalance between 2 polarities, too much emissivity, lack of receptivity, lack of love, high ego, seek recognition. In reality, she is a very close friend of mine, we grew up together and have been friends for over 22 years. We studied in the same elementary, secondary and high school. She protected and took care me a lot, she was like my elder sister, at the same time, I was like her shadow. However, due to some problems in the past, we have not contacted each other for more than 6 years. She is of the 3rd gender SO WHEN YOU MAKE EFFORTS (TRAINING), IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO BECOME TOO EMISSIVE... AND TOO MUCH OF SOCIAL LEVEL IS ALSO A LACK OF FEMININE POLARITY, A LACK OF INTERIORIZATION AND RECEPTIVITY... ] sitting on the middle floor. I stayed on the same floor as Thanh [- a part of my feminine polarity, fragile, pampered, overprotective, the fact she's the only child in the family, she's my high school classmate AND HERE YOU HAVE THE REASONS WHY YOU HAVE A LACK OF INTIMACY, IT IS BECAUSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO FEEL THE PROTECTION FROM THE SOCIAL LEVEL BUT IT GOES TOO FAR IN YOUR INTIMACY (5 BUNK BEDS AND TOO NARROW ASEPCT) ] . The two of us were drinking water and the last ones to go to rest. NOTION OF HYPERACTIVITY, NEED FOR EMOTIONS... Perhaps in my childhood, I was shown that I was protected by family, friends and my inner Phuong too much, so I did not have many experiences and conflicts with life (inner Thanh). These memories gradually formed a part of me. When I was no longer protected by inner Phuong, I gradually built a shell to protect myself, built by feminine polarity, creating difficulty in receiving, listening, and even denying the protection of others. WELL 23/07/2025, 12:05 Childhood friend | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/106995 2/3 UNDERSTOOD IT SHOWS ALSO THAT BEING COMPETITIVE, OVER-EMISSIVE AND EXCELLENT IN MATTER IS A FORM OF PROTECTION NOT TO BE "CRUSHED" BY OTHERS... Next scene, on another evening, most of the people were going out for dinner, I was walking out of the classroom [- represents organization, arrangement at the SOCIAL collective level AND LEARNINGS AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL ALSO DEAR NHU ] (my high school class in reality), holding a bowl of food to eat and finding a place to sit MEMORIES RELATED TO LACK OF RECEPTIVITY RELATED TO THE WAY YOU NOURISH THE WAY YOU COMMUNICATE. HERE YOU SEE THE OTHER EXTREME, IN THE PREVIOUS SCENE, YOU DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH PLACES FOR YOUR INTIMACY TO REST WELL BECAUSE OF TOO MUCH OF SOCIAL, BUT HERE YOU SEE THE NOTION OF WANTING TO BE ALONE, NOT CONNECTING WITH OTHERS... SO YOU SEE HERE THE NOTION OF DISBALANCE... SOMETIMES YOU FUSE TOO MUCH WITH OTHERS, SOMETIMES YOU PREFER TO BE LONELY WHILE YOU ARE IN A LEARNING PROCESS... I walked through the next classroom and accidentally BUT NOTHING IS BY CHANCE OR BY ACCIDENT, EVERYTHING IS ORGANIZED AND IT'S A SYNCHRONICITY NHU met An [- fragile, lack of love, resigned, sacrificed, long-suffering SO HERE YOU ARE MEETING A PART OF YOURSELF THROUGH RESONANCE ] (Phuong's older sister) sitting in front of the class. I was surprised because An also participated in this training trip, and I haven't seen her for a long time. She asked for me, she asked if I had a lover. I said no in a gentle tone. THIS PART OF THE DREAM SHOWS OTHER MEMORIES IN YOU THAT YOU ARE REDISCOVERING FROM UNCONSCIOUSNESS... (DEEP FOREST + NOT SEEN FOR A LONG TIME) WHERE BEING IN A NOTION OF COMPETITION, OVER-EMISSIVITY IN THE WAY YOU ARE LEARNING CREATE SUFFERING, FRAGILITY AND LACK OF LOVE WITHIN... SO THIS DREAM IS ALSO A MESSAGE FOR YOU TO ALWAYS SET A SPIRITUAL INTENTION WHEN YOU ARE MAKING EFFORTS WHEN YOU WOULD LIKE TO IMPROVE SOMETHING IN YOUR LIFE... AND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SPIRITUAL INTENTION IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR QUALITIES... At the same time, Phuong came out from the classroom, Phuong said happily that Nhu has a lover who lives in New York [- too many physical needs, instinctive actions, too many sexual needs ALSO A NEED OF TOO MUCH EXPANSION ] . NEW YORK IS ALSO ABOUT BEING TOO FOCUSED ON MATTER, HYPERACTIVITY ON THE COLLECTIVE LEVEL (CITY) BUT YOU SEE HERE A PART OF YOU WHO IS NOT REALLY HONEST ALSO, WANTING TO APPEAR GOOD IN OTHERS' EYES... SO HERE YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL ANSWER ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR COMMUNICATION, IT IS ABOUT HONESTY AND ACCEPTING AS YOU ARE... A GOOD AND SPIRITUAL PERSON WITH WONDERFUL QUALITIES AND ON THE PATH OF IMPROVEMENT I was surprised to ask how Phuong knew. Because it's true that in New York, there was someone who was talking to me in a flirtatious way, I sometimes reply back but haven't really formed a relationship yet. SO YOU SEE HERE IN YOUR IMAGINATION, THAT YOU CAN GO TOO FAST... YOU ARE CONNECTING WITH UNCONSCIOUS AND EXCESSIVE NEEDS FOR LOVE... AND THIS NEED FOR LOVE CAN EVENTUALLY CREATE A DIFFICULTY TO COMMUNICATE WELL BECAUSE OF BEING AFFECTED BY THE WAY OTHER PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU... ONE DAY, WE DON'T GIVE MUCH IMPORTANCE OF WHAT OTHER THINK ABOUT YOU... BECAUSE YOU WILL KNOW YOUR OWN VALUES... AND IF THEY RECOGNIZE YOUR VALUES AND COMPLIMENT YOU, YOU ARE ABLE TO ACCEPT THE COMPLIMENTS WITH HUMILITY... The end of dream shows that I am nurturing my personal intimacy with too many material and sexual needs (New York), it is an illusion because it has not really formed a relationship yet. YOU CAN COMPLETE THE UNDERSTANDING WITH THE COMMENTS ABOVE Angelic thank you A PROFOUND DREAM DEAR NHU THAT HELPS YOU WITH KEY ANSWERS TO TRANSFORM THE COMMUNICATION WITH SELF FIRST AND OTHERS AS WELL... ANGELIC THOUGHTS WITH NANAEL AND CHAVAKHIAH ... ÂN

title_pdf: 05 Life Dream - The partner s party [2023]. last case id: C0233. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 17 March 2023 Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello teachers ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU I chanted Angel Menadel with the question: what should I do with 2 jobs that I'm working? THE DREAM IS NOT ANSWERING YOU DIRECTLY BUT THE DREAM IS SHOWING THE RESONANCES THAT HAVE ATTRACTED THIS SITUATION I am working a full-time job at OpenLive [- business in the way of multi-level selling based on blockchain technology products: too many material needs, desire to get rich quickly, instinctive action, unhealthy business tendencies (scams, tricks), talking behind others' backs, envy, comparing, look down on others, because of lack of inner confidence, high ego, unfaithful, lack of commitment ALSO DIFFICULTIES WITH THE HIERARCHY AND AUTHORITY ] , and a part-time job at Ufin [- business with the desire to provide technological value to society: having difficulty in learning and implementing expertise (except for Founder, most people do not know the expertise), being too introverted, lacking in outward expression (no desire to show), self-deprecating, talking clichés, being too receptive and obedient ] , which is the company that I just quit my full-time job here to move to OpenLive. At Ufin, I suggested quitting but Founder is Mr. Cuong [- represents a part of my emissivity AND MASCULINE POLARITY SYMBOLICALLY. He has a very high ability to work in detail and also has a broad vision, but lacks ability to balance these 2 parts, lacks a quick grasp, work-holic, lacks the ability to be properly emissive, emotional dependencies, grumpy, inability to trust others. So far, I have noticed that he has changed a lot and is getting better: listening better, reducing his emotional dependence, taking care of himself and his health more ] kept me and transferred me to a part-time position. At that time, I just want to quit because I got a heavy headache, so I want to rest too much BUT AS YOU GOT HEAVY HEADACHE, YOU SHOULD MEDITATE AND TAKE A MOMENT OF INTERIORIZATION... NOT OVERTHINKING ABOUT WORK... I KNOW YOU ARE VERY PERFECTIONIST, BUT THE PERFECTIONISM BECOMES NEGATIVE WHEN IT CREATES NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES... OTHERWISE, PERFECTIONISM IS A GREAT QUALITY WHEN IT IS DONE WITH THE INTENTION TO BECOME A BETTER SOUL AND NOT JUST FOR THE RESULT... . And a part-time job can also give me the finance to pay the bills, so I accepted. OpenLive is a partner of Ufin before, so I had a chance to work with them when I worked at Ufin. Before I start working at OpenLive, I asked Mr. Cuong: whether there is any problem, I work for this company. And he said it's okay, no problems. However, since I started working at OpenLive, I have been surrounded by a lot of negative and bad words about myself at both companies. At the same time, there were some growing conflicts between the 2 companies, even though both were very close partners in the past. AND IT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT YOU HAVE ATTRACTED THIS SITUATION... IT CORRESPONDS TO DUALITIES AND INNER CONFLICTS THAT THE UNIVERSE IS REVEALING FOR YOU... REMEMBER, SPIRITUAL TEACHING IS EVERYWHERE WHEN YOU INTEGRATE SYMBOLIC LANGUAGE ... Last week, at Ufin, Mr. Cuong announced the restructuring of the company, changing the way it operates and works. So far there is nothing happens, but I feel a bit exhausted and I think I couldn't contribute much with my current part-time position IF YOU HAVE TRULY DONE YOUR BEST TO IMPROVE EVERYTHING POSSIBLE AND THAT NOTHING CHANGE, IT IS ALSO A SIGN TO THINK ABOUT YOUR WORK AND YOUR PRIORITY... IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN INSECURITIES MIGHT DRIVE YOUR NEED TO KEEP BOTH JOBS... BUT THINK ABOUT THAT WAY, SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE TOO FOCUSED ON MAKING MONEY, BUT IF YOU LOSE YOUR HEALTH, YOU WILL SPEND THE MONEY TO RECUPERATE YOUR HEALTH... AND SOMETIMES, CERTAIN HEALTH ISSUES ARE IRREVERSIBLE... I DON'T WANT TO MAKE YOU AFRAID BUT YOU SEE, THE INSECURITIES CAN POTENTIALLY CREATE MORE PROBLEMS... SO YOU STARTED TO HAVE HEAVY HEADACHE AND NOTHING CHANGE, IT IS AN INVITATION FROM YOUR UNCONSCIOUS AND THE UNIVERSE TO MEDITATE DEAR NHU ... SO IF YOU HAVE ANALYZED AND FOUND THAT IN YOUR CURRENT POSITION, YOU COULDN'T CONTRIBUTE MORE, THEN IT'S OK TO LOOK FOR A NEW ROLE IN A NEW COMPANY WHERE YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE BECAUSE WORK IS NOT ONLY SOMETHING THAT YOU DO ON THE OUTSIDE, IT'S ALSO WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE YOU, MEANING ARE YOU ABLE TO PRIORITIZE THE DEVELOPMENT OF QUALITIES BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS INTERCONNECTED. Also, at OpenLive, people don't know that I still work at Ufin, I don't hide it because no one asked me, but I think I should end 1 of both early to avoid problems WELL THOUGHT... And I receive this dream. I and some colleagues [- Some of my female teammates represent a part of my receptivity: rebellious, self-deprecating, comparison, cold, superficial, lack of listening and receptivity ] in OpenLive were invited to attend a partner's party [- represents communication and sharing at the social level. This party carries the energy of boasting, high material needs, pleasing others, too much masculinity in outward expression (slightly rigid) DIFFICULTIES IN SHARING AND RECEIVING (EXCHANGES) AT SOCIAL AND ACTION LEVEL ] . The party was held outdoors, in a very large courtyard. The weather is very beautiful with sunshine PARTY BEING HELD OUTDOORS IN THE LARGE COUNTRY YARD WHERE THE WEATHER WAS BEAUTIFUL WITH SUNSHINE, SO HERE THE DIFFICULTIES IN THE EXCHANGES AT THE SOCIAL LEVEL AND ACTION LEVEL CAN CREATE DIFFICULTIES IN AN EXPANSION AT THE SOCIAL/ACTION LEVEL. AND REMEMBER THE BEGINNING OF THE DREAM IS THE MAIN THEME OF YOUR DREAM... THE PARTNER'S PARTY SHOWS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONNECT YOUR INNER OPENLIVE AND OTHER AREAS OF YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS CONCERNING THE WORK... YOU SEE A NOTION WHERE YOU WOULD LIKE TO CREATE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHERS, BUT ON THE CONCRETE LEVEL BEING IN BOTH COMPANIES CREATE PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF WANTING TO PLEASE OTHERS TOO MUCH... THUS CREATING DUALITIES, NOT KNOWING WHAT IS RIGHT AND LOGICAL... In my current job at OpenLive, I show maybe outwardly naive and self-deprecating, I have a partial lack of listening and receptivity, on the other hand, I have appeared to be somewhat linguistically violent, somewhat authoritarian, or overly listening. I haven't balanced this part yet. I am trying to block the reception of energies that I think are not good. I'm still having a hard time understanding the law of Resonance, and harsh on myself. AND THIS SOMETIMES CREATES BLOCKAGES IN THE EXPANSION OF THE ACTION WORLD DEAR NHU. YOU CAN MAKE THE SITUATIONS BETTER FOR YOU AND OTHERS ALSO BY BECOMING RECEPTIVE TOWARDS THE FEELINGS THAT ARE SOMETIMES NEGATIVE, UNDERSTANDING THEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SITUATION, AND TRYING TO BE BENEVOLENT TOWARDS YOURSELF AND OTHERS BY SHARING COMPASSION, UNDERSTANDING OF THE PERSON & SITUATION AND LOVE WITH WISDOM... At the party, I met Mr. Cuong. I shared a table with him and 2 other guests [- the other 2 guests are also male, showing that the way I am sharing on a social level also has a very masculine ratio, a bit stiff and obvious, a bit too strong AND ALSO HOW IT AFFECTS THE RELATIONSHIPS AT WORK ] . Each table can seat 10 people, but there are some tables that are still available because guests do not attend like ours. YOU CAN ALSO LOOK AT THE HUMAN DISTORTIONS OF ALADIAH (THE ANGEL 10), IT WILL GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE WORKED... My table was in a slightly hidden position MEMORIES OF HIDDEN EMOTIONS, AND SUPPRESSED EXPRESSIONS. WHEN IT COMES TO SHARING AT THE SOCIAL LEVEL, THESE HIDDEN MEMORIES CAN CREATE BLOCKAGES. I drank filtered water, Mr. Cuong held a glass of beer [- emotional dependence. Here he doesn't drink beer means he has realized and stopped nourishing himself with this energy, however, he has the energy to please others (he still holds the glass of beer to have fun together) VERY WELL ANALYZED DEAR NHU... AND REMEMBER IN THIS DREAM, MR. CUONG IS A PART OF YOUR MASCULINE POLARITY ] . I was surprised to ask him a funny question: oh, now you drink beer too. He just laughed. HERE YOU CAN SEE DUALITY IN CERTAIN %. YOU DRANK FILTERED WATER THAT REPRESENTS PURE EMOTIONS THAT ARE FILTERED FROM IMPURITIES BUT A PART OF YOUR MASCULINE ENERGY THAT IS SYMBOLICALLY REPRESENTED BY MR. CUONG HAS MEMORIES OF EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES AT THE SOCIAL/ACTION LEVELS. THESE MEMORIES CREATE AN IMBALANCE IN YOUR POLARITIES CREATING A DISCREPANCY IN YOUR RECEPTIVE AND EMISSIVE WORLDS... AND TO MAKE A LINK WITH THE CONCRETE REALITY, YOU SEE EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO HIDE... YOU DON'T WANT TO SHOW THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO PLEASE OTHERS TOO MUCH... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF COURSE... ON THE CONCRETE REALITY, YOU HAD A DIFFICULTY REFUSING THE PART TIME OF MR. CUONG BECAUSE OF THE FEELING OF WANTING TO PLEASE... IMAGINE, YOU ARE ASKING TO LEAVE THE JOB BUT HE GAVE YOU A PART-TIME INSTEAD EVEN THOUGH IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR YOU (SEVERE HEADACHES, ETC.) The host of the party came to my table. Everyone toasted. Then, Mr. Cuong put the glass down and did not drink. After the host left, he told me he was leaving first. When I asked him why, he said he was going to the gym [- representation of the ability to promote health at the physical level: tend to act somewhat violently or violently in words, in the way I communicate BUT HERE THE GYM IS MORE THE NOTION OF THINKING TOO MUCH ON THE OTHER APPEARANCE, TO LOOK GOOD AND STRONG IN OTHER'S EYES... THE GYM IS ALSO THE 23/07/2025, 12:10 The partner's party | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/107423 2/3 NOTION OF EFFORT AND IT CAN BE SO QUALITATIVE AND BEAUTIFUL... BUT HERE THE EFFORTS FROM THE GYM CAN BE TOWARDS THE NEED TO PLEASE OTHERS... IT SHOWS YOUR DEEP CAPACITY TO MAKE EFFORTS BUT IT COST YOU HEADACHES AND DIFFICULTIES BECAUSE THE EFFORTS ARE BASED ON THE EXCESSIVE NEED TO BE WELL SEEN BY OTHERS... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF COURSE... ] . And he also didn't eat anything. = DIFFICULTIES NOURISHING YOURSELF WITH POSITIVE EMOTIONS WHEN YOU STOP A NEGATIVE BEHAVIOR... IT IS WONDERFUL THAT YOUR INNER CUONG IS NOT DRINKING BUT YOU SEE HERE THAT THIS PART OF YOU CAN BE TOO SOLITARY (LEAVING FIRST) AND AT THE SAME TIME WANTS TO SHOW OFF (GOING TO THE GYM)... After that, I invited my colleagues to my table to eat and talk together. People asked who I was sitting with, I replied that Mr. Cuong - Founder of Ufin. HERE YOU CAN ALSO ANALYZE THIS PART OF THE DREAM WHICH IS THE EXCESSIVE NEED TO SHARE WITH PEOPLE TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF LOVE... The dream shows that my inner Ufin represents the ability to nurture and get rid BUT THE USAGE OF WORD "GET RID" STILL IMPLIES THAT THERE IS A DIFFICULTY IN APPLYING THE LAW OF RESONANCE, TOO MUCH NEED TO CHANGE OTHERS of negative things, and distortions in the environment of emotional dependence, to please others. And I stayed with my inner OpenLive (teammates) and continued to nourish myself with the energies of material need. A PROFOUND DREAM DEAR NHU, WHICH IS SHOWING YOU THE UNCONSCIOUS WAYS OF HOW YOU COMMUNICATE, EXCHANGE, AND EXPRESS YOURSELF AT SOCIAL AND ACTION LEVELS... THIS DREAM IS MAINLY ABOUT SOCIAL NEEDS, WANTING TO LIVE AN EXPANSION OF YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS (MAKING PARTNERSHIPS), YOU SEE THAT YOU HAVE ACCEPTED BOTH JOBS... IF I HAVE WELL UNDERSTOOD, YOU HAVE ONE FULL-TIME JOB AND ONE PART-TIME JOB... THIS SITUATION CAN DISBALANCE YOUR LIFE SINCE YOU CAN BE TOO FOCUSED ON WORK... AND YOU SEE THAT PROBLEMS START TO EMERGE BECAUSE UFIN AND OPENLIVE START TO HAVE DISAGREEMENTS... AND PEOPLE HAVE THE FEELING OF NOT BEING HAPPY ABOUT YOU AS THEY CAN EVENTUALLY FEEL THAT WORKING WITH OPENLIVE IS A TREASON FOR THEM... AND THIS DREAM IS REVEALING TO YOU WHY YOU LIVE THIS SITUATION... YOU ARE SHOWN THAT WHEN YOU WANT TO PLEASE OTHERS TOO MUCH, WHEN YOU WANT TO APPEAR STRONG AND BEING ABLE TO MAKE TREMENDOUS EFFORTS, UNHAPPINESS WILL BE CREATED... THIS DREAM IS A TRUE TREASURE FOR YOUR SOUL, DEAR NHU... IF YOU WISH, YOU CAN READ SEVERAL TIMES THIS REVISION IN ORDER TO INTEGRATE THE MESSAGE THAT THE UNIVERSE OFFERS YOU ANGELIC LIBERATION FROM ANY DEPENDENCIES WITH MENADEL AND IEIAZEL , ÂN

    "dream_text": "I and some colleagues in OpenLive were invited to attend a partner's party. The party was held outdoors, in a very large courtyard. The weather is very beautiful with sunshine. In my current job at OpenLive, I show maybe outwardly naive and self-deprecating, I have a partial lack of listening and receptivity, on the other hand, I have appeared to be somewhat linguistically violent, somewhat authoritarian, or overly listening. I haven't balanced this part yet. I am trying to block the reception of energies that I think are not good. I'm still having a hard time understanding the law of Resonance, and harsh on myself. At the party, I met Mr. Cuong. I shared a table with him and 2 other guests. Each table can seat 10 people, but there are some tables that are still available because guests do not attend like ours. My table was in a slightly hidden position. I drank filtered water, Mr. Cuong held a glass of beer. I was surprised to ask him a funny question: oh, now you drink beer too. He just laughed. The host of the party came to my table. Everyone toasted. Then, Mr. Cuong put the glass down and did not drink. After the host left, he told me he was leaving first. When I asked him why, he said he was going to the gym. And he also didn't eat anything. After that, I invited my colleagues to my table to eat and talk together. People asked who I was sitting with, I replied that Mr. Cuong - Founder of Ufin.",

title_pdf: 06 Dream - The ghosts in house [2023]. last case id: C0234. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 24 March 2023 Angel: 36 Menadel Dream mood: Scared, feeling bad, afraid Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello teachers ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU, I continue my question as last week: what should I do with 2 jobs that I'm working? THIS DREAM SHOWS YOU PART OF THE MEMORIES THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO AVOID OR ESCAPE FROM... In the late afternoon HERE INDICATES THE TRANSITION FROM DAY TO EVENING, SYMBOLICALLY A PERIOD IN TRANSITION FROM ACTIONS TO INTERIORIZATION, my housemate [- a part of my feminine polarity and my emotional world: fragile, innocent, in need of protection (lack of inner security), on the outside she seems calm sometimes, like nothing can affect her, careless about many things. This expresses duality in my personality YES, THE LACK OF INNER SECURITY SYMBOLICALLY REPRESENTED BY HER SHOWS YOU THE PERCENTAGES OF RESONATING MEMORIES WHERE ON ONE HAND YOU STILL WANT TO HAVE THOSE 2 JOBS IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE FOR THE NEEDS AND ON ANOTHER HAND HAVING 2 JOBS CREATES DIFFICULTIES IN INTERIORIZATION ] and I were doing homework THE DAILY CHORES HELPS A PERSON TO CONNECT TO THE INNER SELF, TO CONNECT WITH THE PARTS AND INTERIORIZE AND AS HERE YOU AND THE HOUSEMATE ARE DOING IT, IT SHOWS THE DIFFICULTIES IN BEING RECEPTIVE TOWARDS THE WONDERFUL MEDITATIVE ASPECTS OF THE HOMEWORK BECAUSE OF THE 2 JOBS AS YOU SHARED IN THE PREVIOUS DREAM SUBMISSION ALSO in the room. When I turn on the desk lamp, the light is very dim [- Light represents enlightenment, illuminating the conscious level. "The light is dim" represents the confusion between the conscious and the unconscious, the consciousness is unclear, too abstract, lack in concreteness... WELL UNDERSTOOD... HERE THE CONFUSION ARISES BECAUSE OF A DUALITY WHERE WITHIN YOU THERE ARE TWO VOICES ONE SAYING TO CONTINUE WITH 2 JOBS BECAUSE OF MATERIAL INSECURITY AND ANOTHER SHOWS YOU THE DIFFICULTIES THAT YOU EXPERIENCE LIKE A HEADACHE WHEN YOU CONTINUE TO DO SO AND THAT'S WHY THE INNER LIGHT LOSES ITS CAPACITY TO SHINE BRIGHT AND CLEAR THE CONFUSION.. ] . Then, I moved the clothes rack [- represents storage, protection, and varied ability to express myself on the outside. When the clothes rack is next to the window, it shows a part of my tendency to want to show off, but at the same time I want to hide it, showing that I want others to notice me, self-centered ] right at the window to increase the light BUT AS IT WAS AFTERNOON, STILL THE CLOTHES RACK WOULD HAVE BLOCKED THE NATURAL LIGHT COMING IN. SYMBOLICALLY THIS SHOWS THAT A NEED TO SHINE ON THE OUTSIDE, THE TENDENCY TO SHOW OFF CAN BLOCK THE LIGHT, WISDOM, AND GUIDANCE THAT YOU ARE SEEKING HERE WITH 2 JOBS. THE FACT THAT YOU COULDN'T MOVE IT CONNECTS TO THE NEXT PARTS OF THE DREAM WHERE IT WASN'T POSSIBLE TO GET THE GHOSTS OUT AS THIS ASPECT AND PART CANNOT BE IGNORED ANYMORE DEAR NHƯ, but I couldn't. I tried to turn on the other lights but they didn't work or were very dim. I'm starting to feel like there are ghosts [- a part of my unconscious: repression, suppression, acting on instinctive need. Here, the ghosts act in a threatening manner, indicating a desire to attract attention AND THESE INNER GHOSTS REPRESENT MANY UNMET NEEDS ALSO. THE GHOSTS ARE ALSO SYMBOLS OF NEGATIVE MEMORIES THAT ARE NOT YET INCARNATED IN THE ACTION LEVEL... IT IS STILL ON THE METAPHYSICAL LEVEL... GHOSTS ARE ACCUMULATION OF NEGATIVE MEMORIES... ] in the room. My inner ghosts show I go deeper into layers of memory about my repressed instinctive needs, which have not yet been understood and transformed. And my current work environment has triggered this. The dim light showed that my interior was wavered by black and white, by righteousness and falsehood, between positive and negative, which I myself could not clearly distinguish. VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD... AND THIS LACK OF DISCERNMENT CREATES DUALITY. I keep trying to turn them on but the light is still flickering. My housemate is a bit scared and panicky at the moment. I silently prayed in my head: dear brothers and sisters, I need light to study for a bit, please give me some light. HERE THE PERCENTAGE OF DUALITY MAKES THE LIGHT FLICKER AND THIS ABSENCE OF CLARITY CREATED BY THE FLICKERING LIGHT CAN CREATE INSECURITIES, FEARS INSIDE AS REPRESENTED BY THE PANICS OF HOUSEMATES. HERE YOU SEE THAT IN A SUBTLE WAY, YOU ARE MORE FOCUSED ON YOUR HOMEWORK THAN SOLVING THE ISSUES WITH THE GHOSTS... IT MEANS THAT YOU CAN BE TOO FOCUSED ON WORK, ON MATERIAL SUCCESS, HAVING ENOUGH RESOURCES ON THE PHYSICAL LEVEL... THIS SCENE IS AN INVITATION TO BE ABLE TO TRANSFORM THE INNER GHOSTS, THE ACCUMULATION OF NEGATIVE MEMORIES, WHERE YOU CAN BE TOO FOCUSED ON MATTER, ON HOW YOU APPEAR IN THE SOCIAL LEVEL... My inner housemate showed that even though I was still a bit scared inside, I was also able to calm down, not panic and try to communicate, talk to this part of me for comfort. However, I tend to be too comforted without really deep communication or confrontation to really fully cleanse my inner ghosts YES AND IT BLOCKS THE COMMUNICATION BECAUSE THE INTENTION IS MORE TO "KICK OUT" THE GHOSTS RATHER THAN TRANSFORM THEM. Next scene, also at dusk SYMBOLICALLY, DUSK HERE REPRESENTS THE TRANSITION FROM ACTION WORLD TO INTERIORIZATION AND AS HERE YOU WERE EXPECTING SOME FRIENDS, IT TOUCHES THE SOCIAL ASPECTS OF RELAXATION, AND REJUVENATION, my housemate was not at home. I'm at home waiting for some friends to come over. I'm sitting on the sofa in the living room [- represents that I am perceiving things happening on a social level. I aim for natural enlightenment (light), showing that I am sometimes too receptive and passive (doors are open), thinking too open, lack of concentration AND DIFFICULTY SHARING AND BEING RECEPTIVE AT THE SOCIAL LEVEL ] , the doors are open for natural light, so I haven't turned on the lights. I still feel that there are a lot of ghosts around me right now, they don't harm me but they are always moving on the house THESE INNER GHOSTS ARE HARMLESS YET, BUT THIS ASPECT CAN'T BE IGNORED ANYMORE AND THE NEXT PARTS OF DREAM TESTIFIES THAT UNTILL THEY ARE CONFRONTED THEY ARE HARMLESS BUT AS SOON AS YOU THINK OF CONFRONTING THEM, THEY BLOCK YOUR ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE, WHICH MEANS THE INTENTION HERE HAS TO BE RECTIFIED IN ORDER TO TRANSFORM THE INNER EVIL AND NOT THINK OF IGNORING OR ESCAPING AWAY FROM IT. AND WHEN YOU CONNECT THESE 2 SCENES, YOU SEE THE NOTION OF WANTING TO WORK TOO INTENSELY WHILE IGNORING THE GHOSTS, AND THEN THE NOTION OF WANTING TO REST TOO MUCH (SOFA) WHEN YOU ARE ON THE SOCIAL INTIMACY... AND THE GHOSTS ARE STILL THERE WAITING TO BE TRANSFORMED Then a friend came. I was a little scared and asked if she saw or felt anything. This friend said it was normal SO THIS PART OF YOU TRIES TO SEE THINGS AS NORMAL WHICH ISN'T ACCORDING TO THE SITUATION HERE. After that, 2 friends came (1 male and 1 female). The female is Giang [- a part of my feminine polarity and emotional world, she is also one of my close friends in real life, and she recently settled abroad: too stable, there are delays in thinking and acting, lacking the ability to materialize ] . She immediately saw the ghosts and said to me: there are many ghosts around you, even sitting next to you. Are you afraid or do they harm you? I also said that I felt someone sitting next to me, I couldn't see and they didn't harm me, but I felt scared. AT THAT MOMENT, YOU CAN DO THE ANGELIC MANTRA WITH THE INTENTION TO TRANSFORM THE ACCULUMATION OF MATERIALISTIC MEMORIES AND OTHER NEGATIVE MEMORIES SHOWN IN THE DREAM... My inner friends show that I haven't really been aware of these parts. My inner Giang even saw but she didn't have a way to solve them ALSO, IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE THAT YOU HAVE NOT MENTIONED THE MALE FRIEND, THIS ALSO SHOWS A LACK OF MOTIVATION, AND INSPIRATION TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS IN TRANSFORMING THE INNER GHOSTS IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF COURSE... 23/07/2025, 12:13 The ghosts in house | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/107824 2/3 After that, we started searching on Ipad [- seek communication, support, help. I have not yet fully absorbed the law of Resonance, and remember that I need to come back to myself when encountering these psychic events, I act unconsciously when seeking support from the outside world. A better solution is for me and my friends to meditate and chant the name of angel YES, THAT'S A WONDERFUL SUGGESTION... ] for information to drive them away. At this point, ghosts realized that we wanted to kick them out, so all the keywords we searched for "ghost, devil" were automatically deleted or replaced with another word. I thought maybe my typing speed is slow, so they can change it. Then, I asked Siri to search more quickly. And in fact, when I speak, ghosts also intervene, and Siri can't listen to look up for me. SO YOU CAN SEE HERE THESE DIFFICULT PARTS ARE SENSITIVE AND CAN INTEFERE IN YOUR WAY TO COMMUNICATE. THIS IS ALSO A SIGN DEAR NHU, NOW IGNORING THESE INNER GHOSTS OR FINDING SUPERFICIAL SOLUTIONS IS NOT ENOUGH, YOU WILL NEED TO WORK DEEPER BY TRANSFORMING THEM..REMEMBER IT'S STILL IN A CERTAIN % ONLY AND AS YOU ARE READY, THE UNIVERSE HAS GUIDED YOU TO WORK ON THEM... I am still dependent on the outside world too much, I have not really gone inside to transform and solve the problem at the root, but I seek temporary help because I lack security inside and these solutions give me solace. At the same time, I can also feel that I am too independent, because I may have thought that I will be able to solve it on my own, so I do not want to depend on or need help of my family (I didn't go to my parent's house) YES, VERY WELL... AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TRANSFORM THE INNER GHOSTS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DEEPLY MEDITATE ON WHERE THOSE INNER GHOSTS APPEAR IN YOUR LIFE... HOW THE MATERIALISTIC MEMORIES, THE NOTION OF WORKING TOO MUCH CAN AFFECT YOUR LIFE ALSO, IT IS IMPORTANT TO REFLECT ON THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE WISH YOU HAVE 2 JOBS AT THE SAME TIME... SO THAT WAY, YOU CAN TAKE PROPER ACTIONS... After that, my friends need to leave, they advise me to go back to my parents' house [- the source of my inner self and 2 polarities ] or call my housemate to come home early if possible. And fortunately, my housemate returned just in time SO YOU SEE THESE DIFFICULTIES ARE STILL IN A CERTAIN % AND CAN BE TRANSFORMED AS THERE IS STILL HELP, AND SUPPORT AVAILABLE, BUT THERE SHOULD BE NO MORE ESCAPISM OR IGNORANCE... On the day I had this dream early in the morning, there were some problems in Ufin (part-time job) that made me feel like I couldn't communicate with new manager and current HR department BECAUSE THE INNER GHOSTS WERE BLOCKING THE COMMUNICATION, YOU CAN MEDITATE DEEPLY ON THE SITUATION WHEN THIS HAPPENED AND TRY TO GET DEEPER IN THE INNER DIFFICULTIES THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE EXPERIENCED WHICH YOU WOULD HAVE TRIED AVOIDING AT THAT TIME, so I decided to quit my job at Ufin. And 3 days later (today), when I officially handed over all the work at Ufin, Founder of OpenLive asked to meet me privately with hope that I would contribute more to the company, as well as she will increase my bonus benefit for me. I accept to contribute more and declined the bonus benefits HERE YOU CAN SEE THE MONK ENERGY IN THE NEGATIVE, IT WAS OK TO ACCEPT THE BONUS BENEFIT AS IT WOULD HAVE BROUGHT THE FINANCIAL STABILITY THAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR AND DOING 2 JOBS.., but I thought maybe she still would AND EXPECTING AFTER REJECTING IS REPRESENTING DUALITY DEAR NHU... And during the past 2 weeks, I worked with the angel Menadel, at OpenLive in my team, there were 2 female employees who resigned. I feel Universe has continued to arrange for me to work more deeply with memories of material dependence, authority (OpenLive's minus). And I accept this BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO MAKE CONCRETE CHANGES WHEREVER AND WHENEVER POSSIBLE WITHOUT IGNORING BECAUSE ACCEPTANCE WITHOUT CHANGING OR MAKING EFFORTS TO CHANGE IS ALSO A FORM OF ESCAPISM IN REFUGE TRYING TO AVOID RESPONSIBILITIES DEAR INITIATE... Angelic thank you. A PROFOUND DREAM THAT SHOWS YOU THE MEMORIES OF DUALITY, INNER DIFFICULTIES, MATERIALISTIC NEEDS (REPRESENTED BY INNER GHOSTS) AND ESCAPISM... DEAR NHƯ, YOU HAVE REALLY WELL UNDERSTOOD YOUR DREAM... YOU HAVE CHANGED SO MUCH SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE DSSI TRAINING... YOUR ENERGY ALSO CHANGED AND IMPROVED DEEPLY... CONGRATULATIONS FOR ALL YOUR EFFORTS ANGELIC ENCOURAGEMENT IN THE CLEANSING PROCESS OF YOUR NEGATIVE MEMORIES WITH MENADEL AND NITH-HAIAH ... ÂN

title_pdf: 07 Life - 22-year friendship [2023]. last case id: C0235. PDF text: Dream date: Saturday, 1 April 2023 Angel: 19 Leuviah Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello teachers ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU I chanted Angel Leuviah with the intention that: please help me understand the memories of my old best friend HERE YOU CAN REFINE THIS QUESTION BY SAYING "WHAT ARE MY RESONANCES WITH MY OLD BEST FRIEND ?" TO GET DEEPER IN THE MEMORIES RELATED TO FRIENDSHIP THAT CREATES BLOCKAGES IN DEVELOPING UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, DETACHMENT, BALANCE IN POLARITIES ETC. I have no dreams so I will share our stories and some decode that I can understand. Phuong is my childhood friend (the one I mentioned in dream "Childhood friend"). Our mother is colleague and we were born in the same year. We go to school together. From elementary school to high school, most of the time we were in the same class. We were companions in almost everything during our childhood, from hanging out with friends, doing things together, going to extra classes, even skipping school together. When we're together, mostly Phuong will be the one to protect and support me. Even though I'm the same age, I always call Phuong an older sister. And I don't know what comes from that Phuong always protects me, protects me. Partly since I was born I have been quite thin and small, while Phuong is much taller and also has had a high degree of independence since childhood. SO HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE NEED TO FEEL PROTECTED CREATES DEPENDENCIES AND COMPLEXES RELATED TO INFERIORITY AND SUPERIORITY BECAUSE OF LACK OF UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE ALWAYS PROTECTED, EVEN IN DIFFICULT TIMES. During this time, I realized that I had no particular personality. As for me, whatever it is, I have no opinions or desires. AND THIS IS COMING FROM PAST LIVES AS A MONK WHERE YOU WERE FOCUSED ON "EMPTY YOUR MIND" Maybe when at home, my family chooses for me, and when outside, Phuong is the one to do it. Gradually, I asked myself the question: what is my personality, what do I want, what do I love. WONDERFUL SELF-QUESTIONING It's like everything I learn follows Phuong. This period may have gradually revealed the manifestations of my apathy (a major cause of my depression in recent years). YES, ALSO THIS OVER-DEPENDENCY ON OTHERS SOMEHOW CREATES A LACK OF IDENTITY, AND SELF-RECOGNITION INSIDE. Even if Phuong loves a music group, she shared it with me. I don't know if I like them or not, but then gradually when I follow this group, I engraved in my heart that I also love them and I don't really know what it is. AS IT CREATES A LACK OF DISCERNMENT. There was once when we chose a high school to attend (a big school in province or a school in Saigon - a better educational environment, so we can pass the exam to a good University). And Phuong chose to move to Saigon, while I have no idea, I just want to go away from home. And Phuong told me that if we go to different schools, our relationship will not be as close as before. And that's one of the reasons why I chose the same high school as Phuong. Even though it's a very expensive school and far from home (a boarding school in Saigon). SO HERE YOU CAN SEE THE MEMORIES OF EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES THAT CREATE A LACK OF DISCERNMENT AND AFFECT YOUR CAPACITY TO DECIDE AND TAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS. And during 3 years in high school, I gradually realized that I was almost like Phuong's shadow YES, BECAUSE OF A LACK OF SELF- ACKNOWLEDGMENT, AND SELF-IDENTITY. With everyone, we are always together, so no matter what, it will be enough just to tell Phuong, and Phuong will decide everything. And no matter what happens, Phuong will always be the one to notice me, ask about me, and take care of me first BUT THIS CREATES AN IMBALANCE DEAR NHU AS IT CREATES DEPENDENCIES. TRUE UNCONDITIONAL LOVE HELPS DEVELOP DETACHMENT, AUTONOMY AND ABOVE ALL SELF-RESPECT. HERE AS EVERYTHING IS DECIDED BY PHUONG, THIS CREATES DISCREPANCIES DEEP INSIDE YOU . And because of these consolations, I am happy and secure in Phuong's protection, I rely on Phuong, but I have overlooked some things that are important to me YES, ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS THAT YOU HAVE OVERLOOKED IS YOUR OWN INNER POTENTIAL TO DECIDE WHAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU... The universe arranged for Phuong and me to go to different senior classes, and later to different universities. I gradually had to make my own decisions, communicate with people and express myself more. I find that the way I show myself has many actions and gestures like Phuong, although inside I feel quite confident, I realize that I am only confident in a very small circle. But out of that circle, I was scared, self-deprecating and timid. YES AND THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE OVER-DEPENDENCIES ON EVERYTHING ON PHUONG... When I was at university, I was completely separated from Phuong in terms of residence, school, and circle of friends, I really had a clear space to continue to learn the lessons that the Universe arranged and reexamine the relationship with Phuong. During the 4 years, we had times when we didn't see each other. At this time, I am like a bird released from a cage, I plunge into social events, participate in many activities, jobs about starting a business, getting rich, and activities at school. While Phuong is the opposite, most Phuong rarely participates in activities, but Phuong focuses on resting, making friends, and having fun with friends. SO YOU CAN SEE HOW FOLLOWING YOUR LIFE PROGRAM CAN FREE YOU FROM THE DEPENDENCIES AND HELP YOU REALIZE YOUR OWN INNER POTENTIAL... And up to a time, Phuong told me: Phuong heard from our friends that I have changed a lot since university. They see me as a person with unlimited positive energy toward career and personal development. This is also the period when I started to have debts for investment and business to establish a business. I also did not think that I was reckless enough to dare to owe a huge amount of money when I was a student, when I could not earn much money. And especially before that, I had no concept that I needed a lot of money, before that, I was just an ordinary person and lived a normal life, with no special interests. BECAUSE THE DEPENDENCIES IN THE PAST CREATED THE OTHER EXTREME IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE FOR THE FREEDOM AND HERE THIS FREEDOM IS MORE INCLINED TOWARDS MATERIAL POSSESSIONS AND NOT THE TRUE INNER FREEDOM... IN THE PAST, YOU WERE MORE LIKE AN ANCIENT MONK WHO WAS TOO DETACHED FROM MATTER BUT THE MATERIALISTIC MEMORIES FROM EVEN DEEPER ANCIENT PAST LIVES WERE NOT ACTIVATED... When entering the Internship to prepare for graduation, I have a lot of worries about investments, my own business, debts and family, and Phuong has environmental work problems with colleagues, bosses. And Phuong came to me to share. At this time, for me, these problems I have experienced a lot and understand in depth when I have been in contact with many businesses and people outside of society. And I share Phuong my advices, but maybe because she doesn't have as much experience as me, we can't understand each other, and I feel like I can't listen to other people's problems anymore. BECAUSE EARLIER THERE WAS NO LIMIT OR BOUNDARIES IN YOUR DEPENDENCIES ON PHUONG , SO NOW THE SOUL WANTS TO HAVE THOSE BOUNDARIES, AND LIMITS IN ORDER TO PROTECT ITS INTIMACY, BUT THIS CREATES A DISTANCE AS THERE IS LESS UNDERSTANDING NOW. IN A WAY, IF YOU OBSERVE THE PATTERN AND THINK DEEPLY, YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE WAS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING EARLIER ALSO BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME PHUONG WAS DECIDING FOR YOU AND YOU WERE FOLLOWING BECAUSE OF A LACK OF INNER ASSERTION... And a few months before we graduated, I decided to end our 22-year friendship, because I don't know any better way to stop receiving problems from Phuong. Looking back now, I know I was too harsh on myself, in this relationship. Because maybe I have a very high ego inside OK..BUT THERE IS ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE ALSO THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER AND THAT IS RELATED TO THE DYNAMICS OF LACK AND COMPENSATION OF 23/07/2025, 12:13 22-year friendship | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/108424 2/3 DEPENDENCIES AND FREEDOM OF CHOICE, the Universe has arranged that during my childhood I did not have the opportunity to express myself, and when I was able to express myself, I overreacted. I also learned about 2 polarity relationships. Because during University time, Phuong once admitted to me that she was a lesbian. At that time, I don't really know how it will affect our relationship, so I just listen and let it be. SO YOU SEE THE WAY YOU USE THE WORD "SOULMATE" IN THE PERSONAL RESEARCH IS ACTUALLY SHOWING YOU THE MEMORIES OF DISCREPANCIES AND IMBALANCE IN THE POLARITIES AS NORMALLY THIS WORD SHOULD BE USED IN A COUPLE RELATIONSHIP... From my inner Phuong, I can realize that I have comparisons, low self-esteem, a tendency to be jealous when I am not valued, even bad thoughts about the person who protected me. But I know this is a lesson that the Universe has arranged for me to understand myself and realize what I need to transform. ALSO, THESE MEMORIES ARE A RESULT OF YOUR OVER-DEPENDENCIES ON PHUONG ALSO... Angelic thank you DEAR NHU, A CONCRETE SITUATION, ANY REALITY EXPERIENCED OR YOUR EXPERIENCES (REAL LIFE STORIES) CAN BE DECODED LIKE A DREAM BY MARKING IMPORTANT SIGNS AND SYMBOLS AND INTERPRETING THEM WITH PLUS, MINUS.

While Phuong is the opposite, most Phuong rarely participates in activities, but Phuong focuses on resting, making friends, and having fun with friends. SO YOU CAN SEE HOW FOLLOWING YOUR LIFE PROGRAM CAN FREE YOU FROM THE DEPENDENCIES AND HELP YOU REALIZE YOUR OWN INNER POTENTIAL... And up to a time, Phuong told me: Phuong heard from our friends that I have changed a lot since university. They see me as a person with unlimited positive energy toward career and personal development. This is also the period when I started to have debts for investment and business to establish a business. I also did not think that I was reckless enough to dare to owe a huge amount of money when I was a student, when I could not earn much money. And especially before that, I had no concept that I needed a lot of money, before that, I was just an ordinary person and lived a normal life, with no special interests. BECAUSE THE DEPENDENCIES IN THE PAST CREATED THE OTHER EXTREME IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE FOR THE FREEDOM AND HERE THIS FREEDOM IS MORE INCLINED TOWARDS MATERIAL POSSESSIONS AND NOT THE TRUE INNER FREEDOM... IN THE PAST, YOU WERE MORE LIKE AN ANCIENT MONK WHO WAS TOO DETACHED FROM MATTER BUT THE MATERIALISTIC MEMORIES FROM EVEN DEEPER ANCIENT PAST LIVES WERE NOT ACTIVATED... When entering the Internship to prepare for graduation, I have a lot of worries about investments, my own business, debts and family, and Phuong has environmental work problems with colleagues, bosses. And Phuong came to me to share. At this time, for me, these problems I have experienced a lot and understand in depth when I have been in contact with many businesses and people outside of society. And I share Phuong my advices, but maybe because she doesn't have as much experience as me, we can't understand each other, and I feel like I can't listen to other people's problems anymore. BECAUSE EARLIER THERE WAS NO LIMIT OR BOUNDARIES IN YOUR DEPENDENCIES ON PHUONG , SO NOW THE SOUL WANTS TO HAVE THOSE BOUNDARIES, AND LIMITS IN ORDER TO PROTECT ITS INTIMACY, BUT THIS CREATES A DISTANCE AS THERE IS LESS UNDERSTANDING NOW. IN A WAY, IF YOU OBSERVE THE PATTERN AND THINK DEEPLY, YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE WAS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING EARLIER ALSO BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME PHUONG WAS DECIDING FOR YOU AND YOU WERE FOLLOWING BECAUSE OF A LACK OF INNER ASSERTION... And a few months before we graduated, I decided to end our 22-year friendship, because I don't know any better way to stop receiving problems from Phuong. Looking back now, I know I was too harsh on myself, in this relationship. Because maybe I have a very high ego inside OK..BUT THERE IS ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE ALSO THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER AND THAT IS RELATED TO THE DYNAMICS OF LACK AND COMPENSATION OF 23/07/2025, 12:13 22-year friendship | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/108424 2/3 DEPENDENCIES AND FREEDOM OF CHOICE, the Universe has arranged that during my childhood I did not have the opportunity to express myself, and when I was able to express myself, I overreacted. I also learned about 2 polarity relationships. Because during University time, Phuong once admitted to me that she was a lesbian. At that time, I don't really know how it will affect our relationship, so I just listen and let it be. SO YOU SEE THE WAY YOU USE THE WORD "SOULMATE" IN THE PERSONAL RESEARCH IS ACTUALLY SHOWING YOU THE MEMORIES OF DISCREPANCIES AND IMBALANCE IN THE POLARITIES AS NORMALLY THIS WORD SHOULD BE USED IN A COUPLE RELATIONSHIP... From my inner Phuong, I can realize that I have comparisons, low self-esteem, a tendency to be jealous when I am not valued, even bad thoughts about the person who protected me. But I know this is a lesson that the Universe has arranged for me to understand myself and realize what I need to transform. ALSO, THESE MEMORIES ARE A RESULT OF YOUR OVER-DEPENDENCIES ON PHUONG ALSO... Angelic thank you DEAR NHU, A CONCRETE SITUATION, ANY REALITY EXPERIENCED OR YOUR EXPERIENCES (REAL LIFE STORIES) CAN BE DECODED LIKE A DREAM BY MARKING IMPORTANT SIGNS AND SYMBOLS AND INTERPRETING THEM WITH PLUS, MINUS. REMEMBER A FEW OF THE IMPORTANT DIVINE LAWS THAT SAY - DREAMS ARE REALITY AND REALITY ARE DREAMS, EVERYTHING IS A SYMBOL... ANGELIC CONTINUITY WITH JELIEL & HAHAIAH ÂNtitle_pdf: 07 Life - 22-year friendship [2023]. last case id: C0235. PDF text: Dream date: Saturday, 1 April 2023 Angel: 19 Leuviah Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello teachers ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU I chanted Angel Leuviah with the intention that: please help me understand the memories of my old best friend HERE YOU CAN REFINE THIS QUESTION BY SAYING "WHAT ARE MY RESONANCES WITH MY OLD BEST FRIEND ?" TO GET DEEPER IN THE MEMORIES RELATED TO FRIENDSHIP THAT CREATES BLOCKAGES IN DEVELOPING UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, DETACHMENT, BALANCE IN POLARITIES ETC. I have no dreams so I will share our stories and some decode that I can understand. Phuong is my childhood friend (the one I mentioned in dream "Childhood friend"). Our mother is colleague and we were born in the same year. We go to school together. From elementary school to high school, most of the time we were in the same class. We were companions in almost everything during our childhood, from hanging out with friends, doing things together, going to extra classes, even skipping school together. When we're together, mostly Phuong will be the one to protect and support me. Even though I'm the same age, I always call Phuong an older sister. And I don't know what comes from that Phuong always protects me, protects me. Partly since I was born I have been quite thin and small, while Phuong is much taller and also has had a high degree of independence since childhood. SO HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE NEED TO FEEL PROTECTED CREATES DEPENDENCIES AND COMPLEXES RELATED TO INFERIORITY AND SUPERIORITY BECAUSE OF LACK OF UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE ALWAYS PROTECTED, EVEN IN DIFFICULT TIMES. During this time, I realized that I had no particular personality. As for me, whatever it is, I have no opinions or desires. AND THIS IS COMING FROM PAST LIVES AS A MONK WHERE YOU WERE FOCUSED ON "EMPTY YOUR MIND" Maybe when at home, my family chooses for me, and when outside, Phuong is the one to do it. Gradually, I asked myself the question: what is my personality, what do I want, what do I love. WONDERFUL SELF-QUESTIONING It's like everything I learn follows Phuong. This period may have gradually revealed the manifestations of my apathy (a major cause of my depression in recent years). YES, ALSO THIS OVER-DEPENDENCY ON OTHERS SOMEHOW CREATES A LACK OF IDENTITY, AND SELF-RECOGNITION INSIDE. Even if Phuong loves a music group, she shared it with me. I don't know if I like them or not, but then gradually when I follow this group, I engraved in my heart that I also love them and I don't really know what it is. AS IT CREATES A LACK OF DISCERNMENT. There was once when we chose a high school to attend (a big school in province or a school in Saigon - a better educational environment, so we can pass the exam to a good University). And Phuong chose to move to Saigon, while I have no idea, I just want to go away from home. And Phuong told me that if we go to different schools, our relationship will not be as close as before. And that's one of the reasons why I chose the same high school as Phuong. Even though it's a very expensive school and far from home (a boarding school in Saigon). SO HERE YOU CAN SEE THE MEMORIES OF EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES THAT CREATE A LACK OF DISCERNMENT AND AFFECT YOUR CAPACITY TO DECIDE AND TAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS. And during 3 years in high school, I gradually realized that I was almost like Phuong's shadow YES, BECAUSE OF A LACK OF SELF- ACKNOWLEDGMENT, AND SELF-IDENTITY. With everyone, we are always together, so no matter what, it will be enough just to tell Phuong, and Phuong will decide everything. And no matter what happens, Phuong will always be the one to notice me, ask about me, and take care of me first BUT THIS CREATES AN IMBALANCE DEAR NHU AS IT CREATES DEPENDENCIES. TRUE UNCONDITIONAL LOVE HELPS DEVELOP DETACHMENT, AUTONOMY AND ABOVE ALL SELF-RESPECT. HERE AS EVERYTHING IS DECIDED BY PHUONG, THIS CREATES DISCREPANCIES DEEP INSIDE YOU . And because of these consolations, I am happy and secure in Phuong's protection, I rely on Phuong, but I have overlooked some things that are important to me YES, ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS THAT YOU HAVE OVERLOOKED IS YOUR OWN INNER POTENTIAL TO DECIDE WHAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU... The universe arranged for Phuong and me to go to different senior classes, and later to different universities. I gradually had to make my own decisions, communicate with people and express myself more. I find that the way I show myself has many actions and gestures like Phuong, although inside I feel quite confident, I realize that I am only confident in a very small circle. But out of that circle, I was scared, self-deprecating and timid. YES AND THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE OVER-DEPENDENCIES ON EVERYTHING ON PHUONG... When I was at university, I was completely separated from Phuong in terms of residence, school, and circle of friends, I really had a clear space to continue to learn the lessons that the Universe arranged and reexamine the relationship with Phuong. During the 4 years, we had times when we didn't see each other. At this time, I am like a bird released from a cage, I plunge into social events, participate in many activities, jobs about starting a business, getting rich, and activities at school. While Phuong is the opposite, most Phuong rarely participates in activities, but Phuong focuses on resting, making friends, and having fun with friends. SO YOU CAN SEE HOW FOLLOWING YOUR LIFE PROGRAM CAN FREE YOU FROM THE DEPENDENCIES AND HELP YOU REALIZE YOUR OWN INNER POTENTIAL...

title_pdf: 08 Dream - Kasara and baby [2023]. last case id: C0236. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 7 April 2023 Angel: 19 Leuviah Dream mood: Surprise Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello teachers ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU I continue my intention: please help me understand the memories of my old best friend. During the day SO THE DAY HERE SYMBOLICALLY REPRESENTS THE ACTION WORLD THAT HAS MEMORIES OF EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES. IT'S LIKE SOMETIMES THE DECISIONS THAT YOU MAY TAKE RELATED TO WORK/ACTION WORLD IS IMPACTED BECAUSE OF THE DISTORTED MEMORIES OF DEPENDENCIES ON OTHERS, TO PLEASE OTHERS... , on the bed SO THIS CAN HAVE AN AFFECT ON YOUR PERSONAL INTIMACY AND RECEPTIVITY, I lie in the innermost , Kasara [- a part of my feminine polarity and my emotional world: too rigid, too frank, outspoken (so straightforward that sometimes may not pay attention to the listener's feelings), lack of empathy, tolerant, overly emotionally independent, high ego, disinterested in others, tendency to judge others VERY WELL DEEPENED... AND THIS INNER KASARA CREATES LACK OF RECEPTIVITY INSIDE ] is in the middle, and the outermost is a newborn baby [- represents my future, the ability to actualize, express, motivation for the future project (boy): has a joking attitude, lacks the right seriousness, lacks concentration, protects myself OF COURSE ON ONE HAND A NEWBORN BABY SYMBOLICALLY SHOWS OF WHAT'S IN THE PREPARATION IN FUTURE, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT ALSO SIGNIFIES WHAT HAS BEEN MATERIALIZED NOW. HERE THE NEWBORN BABY ALSO INDICATES A LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY IN THE WAY YOU MATERIALIZE, WITHOUT PROPER CARE, OR THE ABILITY TO DECIDE. YOU ARE SHOWN EMOTIONAL AND OTHER FORMS OF ATTACHMENTS AND DEPENDENCIES. AND AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS TOO INTIMATE TO BE ON THE SAME BED WITH YOUR INNER KASARA, THE INNER NEWBORN BABY AND YOUR INNER HA... IT SHOWS THE DEEP NEED OF SPIRITUAL LOVE THAT YOU ARE SEEKING... ] , Ha [- she is my elder sister in reality, she is 7 months pregnant with a baby boy. She represents a part of my femininity and the emotional world: too soft, too open, too receptive, fragile, lacks ability to defend herself, lacks opinions, choices for herself, easily listen to the arrangement of others SO SYMBOLICALLY REPRESENTING YOUR FEMININE POLARITY AND IN A WAY YOUR BEHAVIOUR IN EARLIER YEARS WHEN YOU WERE WITH PHUONG AND DEPENDENT ON HER SO YOU CAN SEE HOW PROFOUND THE UNIVERSE ARRANGES DREAMS AND CERTAIN LIFE SITUATION TO LEARN FROM IT AND EVOLVE... ] 's child. The opening dream shows that I am being overly protective of myself, too secure, lacking in outward expression (my position is in the innermost). At the same time, on the outside action side, I sometimes appear too soft, fragile, to be protected, attracted attention, too open, joking. My inner Kasara in the middle is like a protective wall that I built to protect myself. HERE THE MAIN MEANING IS ABOUT WANTING TO FUSE TOO MUCH WITH OTHERS... AND THE BED IS ALSO A SYMBOL OF LAZINESS AS IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE VERY COMFORTABLE REGARDING YOUR SPIRITUAL PATH... YOU WOULD LIKE TO FEEL THE WARMTH OF LOVE... BUT IN A COMPENSATORY WAY... AND THIS WILL LEAD YOU TO CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES AS YOU OBSERVE IN THE FOLLOWING SCENE... Ha told me and Kasara to look after the baby carefully, so as not to let him fall off the bed [- lack of ability to protect oneself on social level, in intimate aspect, difficulty in expressing, actualizing, lack of concentration, sometimes having a slightly careless attitude, joking WE CAN CONNECT THIS WITH THE PART WHERE YOU SHARED IN YOUR PREVIOUS SUBMISSION HOW YOU SEE PHUONG AS SYMBOL TO PROTECT YOU THEREBY WE SEE HERE TOO MUCH DEPENDENCIES ON OTHERS THAT CAUSE DIFFICULTIES IN YOUR ACTION WORLD ALSO. ] . It seems the baby is a bit naughty. I feel a dangerous position, but I trust Kasara, so I still focus on talking to Kasara [- too much self- centeredness, lack of proper attention to my ability to express ] SO YOU CAN SEE AGAIN YOU TRUST ON SOMEONE ELSE WHEN A RESPONSIBILITY IS GIVEN TO YOU. HERE SYMBOLICALLY YOUR INNER HA GAVE A CHANCE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR INNER BABY (REPRESENTING ACTIONS) BUT THE MEMORIES OF DEPENDENCIES ARE STRONG TO BLOCK THE ABILITY TO DECIDE TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL AND DEVELOP YOUR DISCERNMENT WHEN YOU ARE IN FRONT OF SPIRITUAL PEOPLE... KASARA IS ALSO A COLLECTIVE SYMBOL THUS, SHE ALSO REPRESENTS A PART OF YOU THAT HAS THE POWER TO DIFFUSE KNOWLEDGE ON A COLLECTIVE SCALE... SO YOU SEE HERE THAT YOU CAN LACK DISCERNMENT WHEN YOU ARE IN CONTACT WITH A SPIRITUAL PROFESSOR... IT SHOWS THAT WHEN YOU BECOME SPIRITUAL, YOU CAN DEVELOP A SPIRITUAL EGO, HAVING CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES LISTENING TO OTHERS THAT HAVE AN INFERIORITY COMPLEX AND LACK OF SELF-CONFIDENCE... IT IS VERY PROFOUND TO UNDERSTAND THAT... YOU ARE SHOWN HOW YOU COULD REACT IF ONE DAY YOU BECOME A SPIRITUAL PROFESSOR... SO YOU SEE, YOU CAN GO FROM ONE EXTREME TO ANOTHER...FROM BEING FRAGILE TO BEING TOO CONFIDENT... I was too focused on protecting myself, because it was so safe that no one could interfere, and because it was so easy. And because of the lack of self-interest on the outside (expression, even appearance), my inner baby has a tendency to be disruptive, mischievous to get attention, and as natural of a baby when not cared for or guided. YES, BUT THIS WAY OF SEEING IS MORE ON THE OUTSIDE. HERE IN THIS PART, THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR YOU TO TRANSFORM THE DEPENDENCIES BUT INSTEAD, YOU CHOSE TO BE DEPENDENT... YOU CAN COMPLETE THE UNDERSTANDING WITH THE COMMENTS ABOVE... When Ha passed by, she saw that the baby was slightly rocking and seemed to be about to fall off the bed. Ha reminded myself and Kasara. At this time, Kasara hugged the baby in her arms [- This action shows that I have the ability to protect, comfort and care for my inner baby, but it is only done when prompted. And this action sometimes I just do it, not because I really care about my inner baby (shown in the saying of my inner Kasara). This shows that inside I still have a disinterest, indifference to myself and to the world around me. This probably comes because I'm too much overprotected by my inner Phuong (the old best friend I'm asking about). I rely on Phuong too much, so it can be assumed that Phuong will always protect me, so this part has created my lack of ability to protect, care and express on the outside AND BECAUSE DEEP INSIDE, YOU HAVE ALSO MEMORIES OF OVER-CONFIDENCE AND SPIRITUAL EGO... SOMETIMES YOU CAN DIMINISH YOURSELF IN ORDER TO RECEIVE ATTENTION AND COMPLIMENT... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF COURSE... ] and said that if my child died, I would not regret it HERE THIS IS ON THE EXTREME SIDE OF BEING DETACHED. THIS PART OF DREAM SHOWS YOU TO DEVELOP THE EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN ATTACHMENT AND DETACHMENT, FIRST AND FOREMOST BY UNDERSTANDING THEIR REAL MEANING AND THEN BY BEING RESPONSIBLE AND DETACHED AT THE SAME TIME BUT IT TAKES TIME DEAR NHU, FIRST IT REQUIRES WORKING ON MEMORIES OF DEPENDENCIES AND UNDERSTANDING THE MEANING OF TRUE SPIRITUAL AUTONOMY, SO THIS DREAM IS A PRECISE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION WITH HELP OF WHICH YOU CAN EMBARK OF THE BEAUTIFUL JOURNEY OF DEVELOPING A TRUE SPIRITUAL AUTONOMY... Then she put the baby inside, between herself and me. I was amazed and thinking: oh, how can Kasara be so independent, so determined and so unattached like this? [- I think too positive. The action of my inner Kasara can be interpreted in a positive sense, but here is the negative case, and that should not be with a newborn baby so should be viewed in a negative light. WELL UNDERSTOOD, IT'S MORE LIKE BEING ATTRACTED TOWARDS THE CAPACITIES OF OTHERS (LIKE BECOMING A FAN) AND THIS WAY OF SEEING OTHERS BLOCKS THE DISCERNMENT ] AND WHEN YOU HAVE THIS LINE OF CODE, IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO BE IMPRESSED BY "FALSE" SPIRITUAL PROFESSORS THAT YOU CAN EASILY ENCOUNTER NOWADAYS... YOU CAN WRONGLY PERCEIVE THE QUALITIES OF SOMEONE WHILE THE SPIRITUAL PROFESSOR IS NOT REALLY RIGHT... THAT IS WHY AT UCM, IT TAKES A MINIMUM OF 5 YEARS TO BECOME A THERAPIST... AND THEN WITH THE EXPERTISE DEGREE, THERAPISTS CAN BECOME PROFESSORS IF THEY WISH... THE TRAP FOR A SPIRITUAL PROFESSOR IS TO LET THE SPIRITUAL EGO DEVELOP... AND THE MORE YOU WILL EVOLVE AND FREE YOURSELF FROM EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES, THE MORE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THOSE PATTERNS IN YOU AND OTHERS... YOU SEE HERE THAT YOU CAN BE TOO DETACHED AND IT IS NOT GOOD EITHER... AS SAID ABOVE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP BOTH THE QUALITIES OF RESPONSIBILITY AND DETACHMENT... A moment later, Kasara was talking to me about Ha's problems. She stood next to the bed, pointed directly at Ha [- self-judge (my inner Ha), because my inner Ha is so fragile, even at times I think it can be too weak ] who was lying on the bed and holding the baby in her arms, and said: emotional dependence. AND YOU SEE HOW YOUR INNER KASARA CAN BECOME VERY INTENSE AND LACK DIPLOMACY... AND THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF SPIRITUAL EGO, BECAUSE YOUR INNER KASARA COULD HAVE SHARED PRIVATELY TO YOUR INNER HA... BUT DOING THAT IN FRONT OF OTHERS CAN BE TOO INTENSE FOR YOUR INNER HA... IT SHOWS THAT THE SPIRITUAL EGO FROM YOUR INNER KASARA CAN SOMETIMES DIMINISH OTHERS... YOU SEE THAT IF YOU ARE IN A POSITION OF TEACHING OTHERS, YOU CAN LACK LOVE AND BE TOO DIRECT, YOU CAN LACK DIPLOMACY... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... AND REMEMBER ALSO, THIS DREAM IS HAPPENING IN ONE OF THE MOST INTIMATE PLACE, IT MEANS THAT THOSE MEMORIES ARE STILL WITHIN YOU AND PROBABLY NOT MANIFESTED ON THE CONCRETE LEVEL... BECAUSE YOU COULD ACT CONCRETELY VERY DIFFERENTLY AS A FRAGILE AND SHY PERSON BUT INSIDE, YOU CAN FEEL THE SUPERIORITY COMPLEX, THE NEED TO TEACH OTHERS, MIXED WITH EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES AND 23/07/2025, 12:14 Kasara and baby | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/108818 2/3 THE NEED OF RECOGNITION... THAT BEING SAID, YOU NEED TO ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT A DREAM IS A PERCENTAGE OF YOU... IT IS NOT THE WHOLE YOU YOU HAVE WONDERFUL QUALITIES WITHIN YOU... I followed Kasara's hand pointing at Ha and was a bit surprised. THIS SURPRISING ENDING IS HOWEVER NOT POSITIVE BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL MEMORIES THAT BLOCK THE RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TOWARDS SELF... I have a certain % that can judge others, based on the spiritual knowledge I have learned, I can see a % of what knowledge I am relying on to be able to tend to want to teach others. Perhaps the fact that I have found myself tending to judge others, however, here my surprise at the fact that my inner Kasara was the one to speak out shows that I still lack humility, too knowledgeable, and use the knowledge they know to believe that I am superior to others and have the ability to judge people. IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE THE HUMILITY IN DESCRIBING THE SITUATION... IT IS VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD... The dream also made clear the answer I asked about the resonances with my old best friend: emotional dependence. NOT ONLY EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES BUT OTHERS MEMORIES THAT ARE DESCRIBED ABOVE... And having 3 women in my dream shows that I have built my inner self (Angel 3 Sitael) in these memories since childhood (Phuong is my best friend and Ha is my biological elder sister outside in real life). WELL DECODED During working with Angel Leuviah this week, I feel my physical body is quite tired, sluggish, lethargic, I have a sore throat and a little nausea (manifestations like having a cold). At the same time this week I am also in the new phase of going to the gym, so maybe these events, which are similar to this dream, show me about illness, lack of ability to protect myself outside (weak physical body). BUT ALSO AN ABILITY TO WORK ON THE MEMORIES OF EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES TOO. REMEMBER AS THIS IS A DREAM, IT IS SHOWING YOU A %, YOU ALSO HAVE WONDERFUL QUALITIES DEAR NHU THAT ACTUALLY HELPED YOU TO GET A PRECISE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IN THIS DREAM... When I reflect on myself, during the last time I worked at the company, I realized that my ability to express myself (talk, give opinions and act) was quite weak. In most of the meetings, I keep silent, listen and act WHILE INSIDE YOU HAVE PROBABLY, AT TIMES, YOUR INNER KASARA THAT IS INTENSE OR CRITICIZING CERTAIN ACTIONS , however, recently the results of the implementation have been unsatisfactory and always need to be revised. I've been thinking back to myself for the past 2-3 years, at work (jobs that carry energy fueled by excessive material needs, authority, feminine tends to dominate, masculine sometimes a bit soft), I feel like I'm stuck, not able to show my full potential like before. I also tried, but failed. Perhaps in myself, there is resistance, self-limitation, and self-protection against the desire to receive these energies (in the direction of denial). SOMETIMES WHEN THERE ARE MEMORIES OF EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES OR ANY OTHER FORM OF DEPENDENCIES IT CAN RESULT IN LOW SELF-CONFIDENCE VERSUS OVER-CONFIDENCE... . THIS CAN CREATE DIFFICULTIES IN ACTIONS, BECAUSE OF A SENSE OF ENSURING PROTECTION ALL THE TIME, MEMORIES OF PLEASING OTHERS IN ORDER TO BE IN THEIR GOOD BOOKS, EGO IN CERTAIN % THINKING THAT OTHERS WON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAY/EXPRESS, PLAYING SAFE ALL THE TIME, ETC MAKES YOU FEEL STUCK, BUT WITH A DREAM LIKE THIS ANSWERING DIRECTLY, PRECISELY AND GUIDING YOU TOWARDS THE CAUSE CAN HELP YOU RE-GAIN THAT SELF- CONFIDENCE AND HUMILITY BACK DEAR NHU. IF YOU WISH, YOU CAN WORK WITH ANGEL 27 YERATHEL, TO REGAIN CONFIDENCE BACK IN YOUR DECISIONS... AND ALSO TO DEVELOP THE GENUINE HUMILITY Angelic thank you ANGELIC SELF-CONFIDENCE WITH HUMILITY WITH YERATHEL AND MUMIAH ... ÂNtitle_pdf: 07 Life - 22-year friendship [2023]. last case id: C0235. PDF text: Dream date: Saturday, 1 April 2023 Angel: 19 Leuviah Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello teachers ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU I chanted Angel Leuviah with the intention that: please help me understand the memories of my old best friend HERE YOU CAN REFINE THIS QUESTION BY SAYING "WHAT ARE MY RESONANCES WITH MY OLD BEST FRIEND ?" TO GET DEEPER IN THE MEMORIES RELATED TO FRIENDSHIP THAT CREATES BLOCKAGES IN DEVELOPING UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, DETACHMENT, BALANCE IN POLARITIES ETC. I have no dreams so I will share our stories and some decode that I can understand. Phuong is my childhood friend (the one I mentioned in dream "Childhood friend"). Our mother is colleague and we were born in the same year. We go to school together. From elementary school to high school, most of the time we were in the same class. We were companions in almost everything during our childhood, from hanging out with friends, doing things together, going to extra classes, even skipping school together. When we're together, mostly Phuong will be the one to protect and support me. Even though I'm the same age, I always call Phuong an older sister. And I don't know what comes from that Phuong always protects me, protects me. Partly since I was born I have been quite thin and small, while Phuong is much taller and also has had a high degree of independence since childhood. SO HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE NEED TO FEEL PROTECTED CREATES DEPENDENCIES AND COMPLEXES RELATED TO INFERIORITY AND SUPERIORITY BECAUSE OF LACK OF UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE ALWAYS PROTECTED, EVEN IN DIFFICULT TIMES. During this time, I realized that I had no particular personality. As for me, whatever it is, I have no opinions or desires. AND THIS IS COMING FROM PAST LIVES AS A MONK WHERE YOU WERE FOCUSED ON "EMPTY YOUR MIND" Maybe when at home, my family chooses for me, and when outside, Phuong is the one to do it. Gradually, I asked myself the question: what is my personality, what do I want, what do I love. WONDERFUL SELF-QUESTIONING It's like everything I learn follows Phuong. This period may have gradually revealed the manifestations of my apathy (a major cause of my depression in recent years). YES, ALSO THIS OVER-DEPENDENCY ON OTHERS SOMEHOW CREATES A LACK OF IDENTITY, AND SELF-RECOGNITION INSIDE. Even if Phuong loves a music group, she shared it with me. I don't know if I like them or not, but then gradually when I follow this group, I engraved in my heart that I also love them and I don't really know what it is. AS IT CREATES A LACK OF DISCERNMENT. There was once when we chose a high school to attend (a big school in province or a school in Saigon - a better educational environment, so we can pass the exam to a good University). And Phuong chose to move to Saigon, while I have no idea, I just want to go away from home. And Phuong told me that if we go to different schools, our relationship will not be as close as before. And that's one of the reasons why I chose the same high school as Phuong. Even though it's a very expensive school and far from home (a boarding school in Saigon). SO HERE YOU CAN SEE THE MEMORIES OF EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES THAT CREATE A LACK OF DISCERNMENT AND AFFECT YOUR CAPACITY TO DECIDE AND TAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS. And during 3 years in high school, I gradually realized that I was almost like Phuong's shadow YES, BECAUSE OF A LACK OF SELF- ACKNOWLEDGMENT, AND SELF-IDENTITY. With everyone, we are always together, so no matter what, it will be enough just to tell Phuong, and Phuong will decide everything. And no matter what happens, Phuong will always be the one to notice me, ask about me, and take care of me first BUT THIS CREATES AN IMBALANCE DEAR NHU AS IT CREATES DEPENDENCIES. TRUE UNCONDITIONAL LOVE HELPS DEVELOP DETACHMENT, AUTONOMY AND ABOVE ALL SELF-RESPECT. HERE AS EVERYTHING IS DECIDED BY PHUONG, THIS CREATES DISCREPANCIES DEEP INSIDE YOU . And because of these consolations, I am happy and secure in Phuong's protection, I rely on Phuong, but I have overlooked some things that are important to me YES, ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS THAT YOU HAVE OVERLOOKED IS YOUR OWN INNER POTENTIAL TO DECIDE WHAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU... The universe arranged for Phuong and me to go to different senior classes, and later to different universities. I gradually had to make my own decisions, communicate with people and express myself more. I find that the way I show myself has many actions and gestures like Phuong, although inside I feel quite confident, I realize that I am only confident in a very small circle. But out of that circle, I was scared, self-deprecating and timid. YES AND THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE OVER-DEPENDENCIES ON EVERYTHING ON PHUONG... When I was at university, I was completely separated from Phuong in terms of residence, school, and circle of friends, I really had a clear space to continue to learn the lessons that the Universe arranged and reexamine the relationship with Phuong. During the 4 years, we had times when we didn't see each other. At this time, I am like a bird released from a cage, I plunge into social events, participate in many activities, jobs about starting a business, getting rich, and activities at school. While Phuong is the opposite, most Phuong rarely participates in activities, but Phuong focuses on resting, making friends, and having fun with friends. SO YOU CAN SEE HOW FOLLOWING YOUR LIFE PROGRAM CAN FREE YOU FROM THE DEPENDENCIES AND HELP YOU REALIZE YOUR OWN INNER POTENTIAL... And up to a time, Phuong told me: Phuong heard from our friends that I have changed a lot since university. They see me as a person with unlimited positive energy toward career and personal development. This is also the period when I started to have debts for investment and business to establish a business. I also did not think that I was reckless enough to dare to owe a huge amount of money when I was a student, when I could not earn much money. And especially before that, I had no concept that I needed a lot of money, before that, I was just an ordinary person and lived a normal life, with no special interests. BECAUSE THE DEPENDENCIES IN THE PAST CREATED THE OTHER EXTREME IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE FOR THE FREEDOM AND HERE THIS FREEDOM IS MORE INCLINED TOWARDS MATERIAL POSSESSIONS AND NOT THE TRUE INNER FREEDOM... IN THE PAST, YOU WERE MORE LIKE AN ANCIENT MONK WHO WAS TOO DETACHED FROM MATTER BUT THE MATERIALISTIC MEMORIES FROM EVEN DEEPER ANCIENT PAST LIVES WERE NOT ACTIVATED... When entering the Internship to prepare for graduation, I have a lot of worries about investments, my own business, debts and family, and Phuong has environmental work problems with colleagues, bosses. And Phuong came to me to share. At this time, for me, these problems I have experienced a lot and understand in depth when I have been in contact with many businesses and people outside of society. And I share Phuong my advices, but maybe because she doesn't have as much experience as me, we can't understand each other, and I feel like I can't listen to other people's problems anymore. BECAUSE EARLIER THERE WAS NO LIMIT OR BOUNDARIES IN YOUR DEPENDENCIES ON PHUONG , SO NOW THE SOUL WANTS TO HAVE THOSE BOUNDARIES, AND LIMITS IN ORDER TO PROTECT ITS INTIMACY, BUT THIS CREATES A DISTANCE AS THERE IS LESS UNDERSTANDING NOW. IN A WAY, IF YOU OBSERVE THE PATTERN AND THINK DEEPLY, YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE WAS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING EARLIER ALSO BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME PHUONG WAS DECIDING FOR YOU AND YOU WERE FOLLOWING BECAUSE OF A LACK OF INNER ASSERTION... And a few months before we graduated, I decided to end our 22-year friendship, because I don't know any better way to stop receiving problems from Phuong. Looking back now, I know I was too harsh on myself, in this relationship. Because maybe I have a very high ego inside OK..BUT THERE IS ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE ALSO THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER AND THAT IS RELATED TO THE DYNAMICS OF LACK AND COMPENSATION OF 23/07/2025, 12:13 22-year friendship | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/108424 2/3 DEPENDENCIES AND FREEDOM OF CHOICE, the Universe has arranged that during my childhood I did not have the opportunity to express myself, and when I was able to express myself, I overreacted. I also learned about 2 polarity relationships. Because during University time, Phuong once admitted to me that she was a lesbian. At that time, I don't really know how it will affect our relationship, so I just listen and let it be. SO YOU SEE THE WAY YOU USE THE WORD "SOULMATE" IN THE PERSONAL RESEARCH IS ACTUALLY SHOWING YOU THE MEMORIES OF DISCREPANCIES AND IMBALANCE IN THE POLARITIES AS NORMALLY THIS WORD SHOULD BE USED IN A COUPLE RELATIONSHIP... From my inner Phuong, I can realize that I have comparisons, low self-esteem, a tendency to be jealous when I am not valued, even bad thoughts about the person who protected me. But I know this is a lesson that the Universe has arranged for me to understand myself and realize what I need to transform. ALSO, THESE MEMORIES ARE A RESULT OF YOUR OVER-DEPENDENCIES ON PHUONG ALSO... Angelic thank you DEAR NHU, A CONCRETE SITUATION, ANY REALITY EXPERIENCED OR YOUR EXPERIENCES (REAL LIFE STORIES) CAN BE DECODED LIKE A DREAM BY MARKING IMPORTANT SIGNS AND SYMBOLS AND INTERPRETING THEM WITH PLUS, MINUS. REMEMBER A FEW OF THE IMPORTANT DIVINE LAWS THAT SAY - DREAMS ARE REALITY AND REALITY ARE DREAMS, EVERYTHING IS A SYMBOL... ANGELIC CONTINUITY WITH JELIEL & HAHAIAH ÂN

title_pdf: 08 Dream - Kasara and baby [2023]. last case id: C0236. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 7 April 2023 Angel: 19 Leuviah Dream mood: Surprise Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello teachers ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU I continue my intention: please help me understand the memories of my old best friend. During the day SO THE DAY HERE SYMBOLICALLY REPRESENTS THE ACTION WORLD THAT HAS MEMORIES OF EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES. IT'S LIKE SOMETIMES THE DECISIONS THAT YOU MAY TAKE RELATED TO WORK/ACTION WORLD IS IMPACTED BECAUSE OF THE DISTORTED MEMORIES OF DEPENDENCIES ON OTHERS, TO PLEASE OTHERS... , on the bed SO THIS CAN HAVE AN AFFECT ON YOUR PERSONAL INTIMACY AND RECEPTIVITY, I lie in the innermost , Kasara [- a part of my feminine polarity and my emotional world: too rigid, too frank, outspoken (so straightforward that sometimes may not pay attention to the listener's feelings), lack of empathy, tolerant, overly emotionally independent, high ego, disinterested in others, tendency to judge others VERY WELL DEEPENED... AND THIS INNER KASARA CREATES LACK OF RECEPTIVITY INSIDE ] is in the middle, and the outermost is a newborn baby [- represents my future, the ability to actualize, express, motivation for the future project (boy): has a joking attitude, lacks the right seriousness, lacks concentration, protects myself OF COURSE ON ONE HAND A NEWBORN BABY SYMBOLICALLY SHOWS OF WHAT'S IN THE PREPARATION IN FUTURE, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT ALSO SIGNIFIES WHAT HAS BEEN MATERIALIZED NOW. HERE THE NEWBORN BABY ALSO INDICATES A LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY IN THE WAY YOU MATERIALIZE, WITHOUT PROPER CARE, OR THE ABILITY TO DECIDE. YOU ARE SHOWN EMOTIONAL AND OTHER FORMS OF ATTACHMENTS AND DEPENDENCIES. AND AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS TOO INTIMATE TO BE ON THE SAME BED WITH YOUR INNER KASARA, THE INNER NEWBORN BABY AND YOUR INNER HA... IT SHOWS THE DEEP NEED OF SPIRITUAL LOVE THAT YOU ARE SEEKING... ] , Ha [- she is my elder sister in reality, she is 7 months pregnant with a baby boy. She represents a part of my femininity and the emotional world: too soft, too open, too receptive, fragile, lacks ability to defend herself, lacks opinions, choices for herself, easily listen to the arrangement of others SO SYMBOLICALLY REPRESENTING YOUR FEMININE POLARITY AND IN A WAY YOUR BEHAVIOUR IN EARLIER YEARS WHEN YOU WERE WITH PHUONG AND DEPENDENT ON HER SO YOU CAN SEE HOW PROFOUND THE UNIVERSE ARRANGES DREAMS AND CERTAIN LIFE SITUATION TO LEARN FROM IT AND EVOLVE... ] 's child. The opening dream shows that I am being overly protective of myself, too secure, lacking in outward expression (my position is in the innermost). At the same time, on the outside action side, I sometimes appear too soft, fragile, to be protected, attracted attention, too open, joking. My inner Kasara in the middle is like a protective wall that I built to protect myself. HERE THE MAIN MEANING IS ABOUT WANTING TO FUSE TOO MUCH WITH OTHERS... AND THE BED IS ALSO A SYMBOL OF LAZINESS AS IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE VERY COMFORTABLE REGARDING YOUR SPIRITUAL PATH... YOU WOULD LIKE TO FEEL THE WARMTH OF LOVE... BUT IN A COMPENSATORY WAY... AND THIS WILL LEAD YOU TO CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES AS YOU OBSERVE IN THE FOLLOWING SCENE... Ha told me and Kasara to look after the baby carefully, so as not to let him fall off the bed [- lack of ability to protect oneself on social level, in intimate aspect, difficulty in expressing, actualizing, lack of concentration, sometimes having a slightly careless attitude, joking WE CAN CONNECT THIS WITH THE PART WHERE YOU SHARED IN YOUR PREVIOUS SUBMISSION HOW YOU SEE PHUONG AS SYMBOL TO PROTECT YOU THEREBY WE SEE HERE TOO MUCH DEPENDENCIES ON OTHERS THAT CAUSE DIFFICULTIES IN YOUR ACTION WORLD ALSO. ] . It seems the baby is a bit naughty. I feel a dangerous position, but I trust Kasara, so I still focus on talking to Kasara [- too much self- centeredness, lack of proper attention to my ability to express ] SO YOU CAN SEE AGAIN YOU TRUST ON SOMEONE ELSE WHEN A RESPONSIBILITY IS GIVEN TO YOU. HERE SYMBOLICALLY YOUR INNER HA GAVE A CHANCE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR INNER BABY (REPRESENTING ACTIONS) BUT THE MEMORIES OF DEPENDENCIES ARE STRONG TO BLOCK THE ABILITY TO DECIDE TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL AND DEVELOP YOUR DISCERNMENT WHEN YOU ARE IN FRONT OF SPIRITUAL PEOPLE... KASARA IS ALSO A COLLECTIVE SYMBOL THUS, SHE ALSO REPRESENTS A PART OF YOU THAT HAS THE POWER TO DIFFUSE KNOWLEDGE ON A COLLECTIVE SCALE... SO YOU SEE HERE THAT YOU CAN LACK DISCERNMENT WHEN YOU ARE IN CONTACT WITH A SPIRITUAL PROFESSOR... IT SHOWS THAT WHEN YOU BECOME SPIRITUAL, YOU CAN DEVELOP A SPIRITUAL EGO, HAVING CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES LISTENING TO OTHERS THAT HAVE AN INFERIORITY COMPLEX AND LACK OF SELF-CONFIDENCE... IT IS VERY PROFOUND TO UNDERSTAND THAT... YOU ARE SHOWN HOW YOU COULD REACT IF ONE DAY YOU BECOME A SPIRITUAL PROFESSOR... SO YOU SEE, YOU CAN GO FROM ONE EXTREME TO ANOTHER...FROM BEING FRAGILE TO BEING TOO CONFIDENT... I was too focused on protecting myself, because it was so safe that no one could interfere, and because it was so easy. And because of the lack of self-interest on the outside (expression, even appearance), my inner baby has a tendency to be disruptive, mischievous to get attention, and as natural of a baby when not cared for or guided. YES, BUT THIS WAY OF SEEING IS MORE ON THE OUTSIDE. HERE IN THIS PART, THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR YOU TO TRANSFORM THE DEPENDENCIES BUT INSTEAD, YOU CHOSE TO BE DEPENDENT... YOU CAN COMPLETE THE UNDERSTANDING WITH THE COMMENTS ABOVE... When Ha passed by, she saw that the baby was slightly rocking and seemed to be about to fall off the bed. Ha reminded myself and Kasara. At this time, Kasara hugged the baby in her arms [- This action shows that I have the ability to protect, comfort and care for my inner baby, but it is only done when prompted. And this action sometimes I just do it, not because I really care about my inner baby (shown in the saying of my inner Kasara). This shows that inside I still have a disinterest, indifference to myself and to the world around me. This probably comes because I'm too much overprotected by my inner Phuong (the old best friend I'm asking about). I rely on Phuong too much, so it can be assumed that Phuong will always protect me, so this part has created my lack of ability to protect, care and express on the outside AND BECAUSE DEEP INSIDE, YOU HAVE ALSO MEMORIES OF OVER-CONFIDENCE AND SPIRITUAL EGO... SOMETIMES YOU CAN DIMINISH YOURSELF IN ORDER TO RECEIVE ATTENTION AND COMPLIMENT... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF COURSE... ] and said that if my child died, I would not regret it HERE THIS IS ON THE EXTREME SIDE OF BEING DETACHED. THIS PART OF DREAM SHOWS YOU TO DEVELOP THE EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN ATTACHMENT AND DETACHMENT, FIRST AND FOREMOST BY UNDERSTANDING THEIR REAL MEANING AND THEN BY BEING RESPONSIBLE AND DETACHED AT THE SAME TIME BUT IT TAKES TIME DEAR NHU, FIRST IT REQUIRES WORKING ON MEMORIES OF DEPENDENCIES AND UNDERSTANDING THE MEANING OF TRUE SPIRITUAL AUTONOMY, SO THIS DREAM IS A PRECISE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION WITH HELP OF WHICH YOU CAN EMBARK OF THE BEAUTIFUL JOURNEY OF DEVELOPING A TRUE SPIRITUAL AUTONOMY... Then she put the baby inside, between herself and me. I was amazed and thinking: oh, how can Kasara be so independent, so determined and so unattached like this? [- I think too positive. The action of my inner Kasara can be interpreted in a positive sense, but here is the negative case, and that should not be with a newborn baby so should be viewed in a negative light. WELL UNDERSTOOD, IT'S MORE LIKE BEING ATTRACTED TOWARDS THE CAPACITIES OF OTHERS (LIKE BECOMING A FAN) AND THIS WAY OF SEEING OTHERS BLOCKS THE DISCERNMENT ] AND WHEN YOU HAVE THIS LINE OF CODE, IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO BE IMPRESSED BY "FALSE" SPIRITUAL PROFESSORS THAT YOU CAN EASILY ENCOUNTER NOWADAYS... YOU CAN WRONGLY PERCEIVE THE QUALITIES OF SOMEONE WHILE THE SPIRITUAL PROFESSOR IS NOT REALLY RIGHT... THAT IS WHY AT UCM, IT TAKES A MINIMUM OF 5 YEARS TO BECOME A THERAPIST... AND THEN WITH THE EXPERTISE DEGREE, THERAPISTS CAN BECOME PROFESSORS IF THEY WISH... THE TRAP FOR A SPIRITUAL PROFESSOR IS TO LET THE SPIRITUAL EGO DEVELOP... AND THE MORE YOU WILL EVOLVE AND FREE YOURSELF FROM EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES, THE MORE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THOSE PATTERNS IN YOU AND OTHERS... YOU SEE HERE THAT YOU CAN BE TOO DETACHED AND IT IS NOT GOOD EITHER... AS SAID ABOVE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP BOTH THE QUALITIES OF RESPONSIBILITY AND DETACHMENT... A moment later, Kasara was talking to me about Ha's problems. She stood next to the bed, pointed directly at Ha [- self-judge (my inner Ha), because my inner Ha is so fragile, even at times I think it can be too weak ] who was lying on the bed and holding the baby in her arms, and said: emotional dependence. AND YOU SEE HOW YOUR INNER KASARA CAN BECOME VERY INTENSE AND LACK DIPLOMACY... AND THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF SPIRITUAL EGO, BECAUSE YOUR INNER KASARA COULD HAVE SHARED PRIVATELY TO YOUR INNER HA... BUT DOING THAT IN FRONT OF OTHERS CAN BE TOO INTENSE FOR YOUR INNER HA... IT SHOWS THAT THE SPIRITUAL EGO FROM YOUR INNER KASARA CAN SOMETIMES DIMINISH OTHERS... YOU SEE THAT IF YOU ARE IN A POSITION OF TEACHING OTHERS, YOU CAN LACK LOVE AND BE TOO DIRECT, YOU CAN LACK DIPLOMACY... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... AND REMEMBER ALSO, THIS DREAM IS HAPPENING IN ONE OF THE MOST INTIMATE PLACE, IT MEANS THAT THOSE MEMORIES ARE STILL WITHIN YOU AND PROBABLY NOT MANIFESTED ON THE CONCRETE LEVEL... BECAUSE YOU COULD ACT CONCRETELY VERY DIFFERENTLY AS A FRAGILE AND SHY PERSON BUT INSIDE, YOU CAN FEEL THE SUPERIORITY COMPLEX, THE NEED TO TEACH OTHERS, MIXED WITH EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES AND 23/07/2025, 12:14 Kasara and baby | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/108818 2/3 THE NEED OF RECOGNITION... THAT BEING SAID, YOU NEED TO ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT A DREAM IS A PERCENTAGE OF YOU... IT IS NOT THE WHOLE YOU YOU HAVE WONDERFUL QUALITIES WITHIN YOU... I followed Kasara's hand pointing at Ha and was a bit surprised. THIS SURPRISING ENDING IS HOWEVER NOT POSITIVE BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL MEMORIES THAT BLOCK THE RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TOWARDS SELF... I have a certain % that can judge others, based on the spiritual knowledge I have learned, I can see a % of what knowledge I am relying on to be able to tend to want to teach others. Perhaps the fact that I have found myself tending to judge others, however, here my surprise at the fact that my inner Kasara was the one to speak out shows that I still lack humility, too knowledgeable, and use the knowledge they know to believe that I am superior to others and have the ability to judge people. IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE THE HUMILITY IN DESCRIBING THE SITUATION... IT IS VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD... The dream also made clear the answer I asked about the resonances with my old best friend: emotional dependence. NOT ONLY EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES BUT OTHERS MEMORIES THAT ARE DESCRIBED ABOVE... And having 3 women in my dream shows that I have built my inner self (Angel 3 Sitael) in these memories since childhood (Phuong is my best friend and Ha is my biological elder sister outside in real life). WELL DECODED During working with Angel Leuviah this week, I feel my physical body is quite tired, sluggish, lethargic, I have a sore throat and a little nausea (manifestations like having a cold). At the same time this week I am also in the new phase of going to the gym, so maybe these events, which are similar to this dream, show me about illness, lack of ability to protect myself outside (weak physical body). BUT ALSO AN ABILITY TO WORK ON THE MEMORIES OF EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES TOO. REMEMBER AS THIS IS A DREAM, IT IS SHOWING YOU A %, YOU ALSO HAVE WONDERFUL QUALITIES DEAR NHU THAT ACTUALLY HELPED YOU TO GET A PRECISE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IN THIS DREAM... When I reflect on myself, during the last time I worked at the company, I realized that my ability to express myself (talk, give opinions and act) was quite weak. In most of the meetings, I keep silent, listen and act WHILE INSIDE YOU HAVE PROBABLY, AT TIMES, YOUR INNER KASARA THAT IS INTENSE OR CRITICIZING CERTAIN ACTIONS , however, recently the results of the implementation have been unsatisfactory and always need to be revised. I've been thinking back to myself for the past 2-3 years, at work (jobs that carry energy fueled by excessive material needs, authority, feminine tends to dominate, masculine sometimes a bit soft), I feel like I'm stuck, not able to show my full potential like before. I also tried, but failed. Perhaps in myself, there is resistance, self-limitation, and self-protection against the desire to receive these energies (in the direction of denial). SOMETIMES WHEN THERE ARE MEMORIES OF EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES OR ANY OTHER FORM OF DEPENDENCIES IT CAN RESULT IN LOW SELF-CONFIDENCE VERSUS OVER-CONFIDENCE... . THIS CAN CREATE DIFFICULTIES IN ACTIONS, BECAUSE OF A SENSE OF ENSURING PROTECTION ALL THE TIME, MEMORIES OF PLEASING OTHERS IN ORDER TO BE IN THEIR GOOD BOOKS, EGO IN CERTAIN % THINKING THAT OTHERS WON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAY/EXPRESS, PLAYING SAFE ALL THE TIME, ETC MAKES YOU FEEL STUCK, BUT WITH A DREAM LIKE THIS ANSWERING DIRECTLY, PRECISELY AND GUIDING YOU TOWARDS THE CAUSE CAN HELP YOU RE-GAIN THAT SELF- CONFIDENCE AND HUMILITY BACK DEAR NHU. IF YOU WISH, YOU CAN WORK WITH ANGEL 27 YERATHEL, TO REGAIN CONFIDENCE BACK IN YOUR DECISIONS... AND ALSO TO DEVELOP THE GENUINE HUMILITY Angelic thank you ANGELIC SELF-CONFIDENCE WITH HUMILITY WITH YERATHEL AND MUMIAH ... ÂNtitle_pdf: 06 Dream - The ghosts in house [2023]. last case id: C0234. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 24 March 2023 Angel: 36 Menadel Dream mood: Scared, feeling bad, afraid Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello teachers ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU, I continue my question as last week: what should I do with 2 jobs that I'm working? THIS DREAM SHOWS YOU PART OF THE MEMORIES THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO AVOID OR ESCAPE FROM... In the late afternoon HERE INDICATES THE TRANSITION FROM DAY TO EVENING, SYMBOLICALLY A PERIOD IN TRANSITION FROM ACTIONS TO INTERIORIZATION, my housemate [- a part of my feminine polarity and my emotional world: fragile, innocent, in need of protection (lack of inner security), on the outside she seems calm sometimes, like nothing can affect her, careless about many things. This expresses duality in my personality YES, THE LACK OF INNER SECURITY SYMBOLICALLY REPRESENTED BY HER SHOWS YOU THE PERCENTAGES OF RESONATING MEMORIES WHERE ON ONE HAND YOU STILL WANT TO HAVE THOSE 2 JOBS IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE FOR THE NEEDS AND ON ANOTHER HAND HAVING 2 JOBS CREATES DIFFICULTIES IN INTERIORIZATION ] and I were doing homework THE DAILY CHORES HELPS A PERSON TO CONNECT TO THE INNER SELF, TO CONNECT WITH THE PARTS AND INTERIORIZE AND AS HERE YOU AND THE HOUSEMATE ARE DOING IT, IT SHOWS THE DIFFICULTIES IN BEING RECEPTIVE TOWARDS THE WONDERFUL MEDITATIVE ASPECTS OF THE HOMEWORK BECAUSE OF THE 2 JOBS AS YOU SHARED IN THE PREVIOUS DREAM SUBMISSION ALSO in the room. When I turn on the desk lamp, the light is very dim [- Light represents enlightenment, illuminating the conscious level. "The light is dim" represents the confusion between the conscious and the unconscious, the consciousness is unclear, too abstract, lack in concreteness... WELL UNDERSTOOD... HERE THE CONFUSION ARISES BECAUSE OF A DUALITY WHERE WITHIN YOU THERE ARE TWO VOICES ONE SAYING TO CONTINUE WITH 2 JOBS BECAUSE OF MATERIAL INSECURITY AND ANOTHER SHOWS YOU THE DIFFICULTIES THAT YOU EXPERIENCE LIKE A HEADACHE WHEN YOU CONTINUE TO DO SO AND THAT'S WHY THE INNER LIGHT LOSES ITS CAPACITY TO SHINE BRIGHT AND CLEAR THE CONFUSION.. ] . Then, I moved the clothes rack [- represents storage, protection, and varied ability to express myself on the outside. When the clothes rack is next to the window, it shows a part of my tendency to want to show off, but at the same time I want to hide it, showing that I want others to notice me, self-centered ] right at the window to increase the light BUT AS IT WAS AFTERNOON, STILL THE CLOTHES RACK WOULD HAVE BLOCKED THE NATURAL LIGHT COMING IN. SYMBOLICALLY THIS SHOWS THAT A NEED TO SHINE ON THE OUTSIDE, THE TENDENCY TO SHOW OFF CAN BLOCK THE LIGHT, WISDOM, AND GUIDANCE THAT YOU ARE SEEKING HERE WITH 2 JOBS. THE FACT THAT YOU COULDN'T MOVE IT CONNECTS TO THE NEXT PARTS OF THE DREAM WHERE IT WASN'T POSSIBLE TO GET THE GHOSTS OUT AS THIS ASPECT AND PART CANNOT BE IGNORED ANYMORE DEAR NHƯ, but I couldn't. I tried to turn on the other lights but they didn't work or were very dim. I'm starting to feel like there are ghosts [- a part of my unconscious: repression, suppression, acting on instinctive need. Here, the ghosts act in a threatening manner, indicating a desire to attract attention AND THESE INNER GHOSTS REPRESENT MANY UNMET NEEDS ALSO. THE GHOSTS ARE ALSO SYMBOLS OF NEGATIVE MEMORIES THAT ARE NOT YET INCARNATED IN THE ACTION LEVEL... IT IS STILL ON THE METAPHYSICAL LEVEL... GHOSTS ARE ACCUMULATION OF NEGATIVE MEMORIES... ] in the room. My inner ghosts show I go deeper into layers of memory about my repressed instinctive needs, which have not yet been understood and transformed. And my current work environment has triggered this. The dim light showed that my interior was wavered by black and white, by righteousness and falsehood, between positive and negative, which I myself could not clearly distinguish. VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD... AND THIS LACK OF DISCERNMENT CREATES DUALITY. I keep trying to turn them on but the light is still flickering. My housemate is a bit scared and panicky at the moment. I silently prayed in my head: dear brothers and sisters, I need light to study for a bit, please give me some light. HERE THE PERCENTAGE OF DUALITY MAKES THE LIGHT FLICKER AND THIS ABSENCE OF CLARITY CREATED BY THE FLICKERING LIGHT CAN CREATE INSECURITIES, FEARS INSIDE AS REPRESENTED BY THE PANICS OF HOUSEMATES. HERE YOU SEE THAT IN A SUBTLE WAY, YOU ARE MORE FOCUSED ON YOUR HOMEWORK THAN SOLVING THE ISSUES WITH THE GHOSTS... IT MEANS THAT YOU CAN BE TOO FOCUSED ON WORK, ON MATERIAL SUCCESS, HAVING ENOUGH RESOURCES ON THE PHYSICAL LEVEL... THIS SCENE IS AN INVITATION TO BE ABLE TO TRANSFORM THE INNER GHOSTS, THE ACCUMULATION OF NEGATIVE MEMORIES, WHERE YOU CAN BE TOO FOCUSED ON MATTER, ON HOW YOU APPEAR IN THE SOCIAL LEVEL... My inner housemate showed that even though I was still a bit scared inside, I was also able to calm down, not panic and try to communicate, talk to this part of me for comfort. However, I tend to be too comforted without really deep communication or confrontation to really fully cleanse my inner ghosts YES AND IT BLOCKS THE COMMUNICATION BECAUSE THE INTENTION IS MORE TO "KICK OUT" THE GHOSTS RATHER THAN TRANSFORM THEM. Next scene, also at dusk SYMBOLICALLY, DUSK HERE REPRESENTS THE TRANSITION FROM ACTION WORLD TO INTERIORIZATION AND AS HERE YOU WERE EXPECTING SOME FRIENDS, IT TOUCHES THE SOCIAL ASPECTS OF RELAXATION, AND REJUVENATION, my housemate was not at home. I'm at home waiting for some friends to come over. I'm sitting on the sofa in the living room [- represents that I am perceiving things happening on a social level. I aim for natural enlightenment (light), showing that I am sometimes too receptive and passive (doors are open), thinking too open, lack of concentration AND DIFFICULTY SHARING AND BEING RECEPTIVE AT THE SOCIAL LEVEL ] , the doors are open for natural light, so I haven't turned on the lights. I still feel that there are a lot of ghosts around me right now, they don't harm me but they are always moving on the house THESE INNER GHOSTS ARE HARMLESS YET, BUT THIS ASPECT CAN'T BE IGNORED ANYMORE AND THE NEXT PARTS OF DREAM TESTIFIES THAT UNTILL THEY ARE CONFRONTED THEY ARE HARMLESS BUT AS SOON AS YOU THINK OF CONFRONTING THEM, THEY BLOCK YOUR ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE, WHICH MEANS THE INTENTION HERE HAS TO BE RECTIFIED IN ORDER TO TRANSFORM THE INNER EVIL AND NOT THINK OF IGNORING OR ESCAPING AWAY FROM IT. AND WHEN YOU CONNECT THESE 2 SCENES, YOU SEE THE NOTION OF WANTING TO WORK TOO INTENSELY WHILE IGNORING THE GHOSTS, AND THEN THE NOTION OF WANTING TO REST TOO MUCH (SOFA) WHEN YOU ARE ON THE SOCIAL INTIMACY... AND THE GHOSTS ARE STILL THERE WAITING TO BE TRANSFORMED Then a friend came. I was a little scared and asked if she saw or felt anything. This friend said it was normal SO THIS PART OF YOU TRIES TO SEE THINGS AS NORMAL WHICH ISN'T ACCORDING TO THE SITUATION HERE. After that, 2 friends came (1 male and 1 female). The female is Giang [- a part of my feminine polarity and emotional world, she is also one of my close friends in real life, and she recently settled abroad: too stable, there are delays in thinking and acting, lacking the ability to materialize ] . She immediately saw the ghosts and said to me: there are many ghosts around you, even sitting next to you. Are you afraid or do they harm you? I also said that I felt someone sitting next to me, I couldn't see and they didn't harm me, but I felt scared. AT THAT MOMENT, YOU CAN DO THE ANGELIC MANTRA WITH THE INTENTION TO TRANSFORM THE ACCULUMATION OF MATERIALISTIC MEMORIES AND OTHER NEGATIVE MEMORIES SHOWN IN THE DREAM... My inner friends show that I haven't really been aware of these parts. My inner Giang even saw but she didn't have a way to solve them ALSO, IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE THAT YOU HAVE NOT MENTIONED THE MALE FRIEND, THIS ALSO SHOWS A LACK OF MOTIVATION, AND INSPIRATION TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS IN TRANSFORMING THE INNER GHOSTS IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF COURSE... 23/07/2025, 12:13 The ghosts in house | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/107824 2/3 After that, we started searching on Ipad [- seek communication, support, help. I have not yet fully absorbed the law of Resonance, and remember that I need to come back to myself when encountering these psychic events, I act unconsciously when seeking support from the outside world. A better solution is for me and my friends to meditate and chant the name of angel YES, THAT'S A WONDERFUL SUGGESTION... ] for information to drive them away. At this point, ghosts realized that we wanted to kick them out, so all the keywords we searched for "ghost, devil" were automatically deleted or replaced with another word. I thought maybe my typing speed is slow, so they can change it. Then, I asked Siri to search more quickly. And in fact, when I speak, ghosts also intervene, and Siri can't listen to look up for me. SO YOU CAN SEE HERE THESE DIFFICULT PARTS ARE SENSITIVE AND CAN INTEFERE IN YOUR WAY TO COMMUNICATE. THIS IS ALSO A SIGN DEAR NHU, NOW IGNORING THESE INNER GHOSTS OR FINDING SUPERFICIAL SOLUTIONS IS NOT ENOUGH, YOU WILL NEED TO WORK DEEPER BY TRANSFORMING THEM..REMEMBER IT'S STILL IN A CERTAIN % ONLY AND AS YOU ARE READY, THE UNIVERSE HAS GUIDED YOU TO WORK ON THEM... I am still dependent on the outside world too much, I have not really gone inside to transform and solve the problem at the root, but I seek temporary help because I lack security inside and these solutions give me solace. At the same time, I can also feel that I am too independent, because I may have thought that I will be able to solve it on my own, so I do not want to depend on or need help of my family (I didn't go to my parent's house) YES, VERY WELL... AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TRANSFORM THE INNER GHOSTS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DEEPLY MEDITATE ON WHERE THOSE INNER GHOSTS APPEAR IN YOUR LIFE... HOW THE MATERIALISTIC MEMORIES, THE NOTION OF WORKING TOO MUCH CAN AFFECT YOUR LIFE ALSO, IT IS IMPORTANT TO REFLECT ON THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE WISH YOU HAVE 2 JOBS AT THE SAME TIME... SO THAT WAY, YOU CAN TAKE PROPER ACTIONS... After that, my friends need to leave, they advise me to go back to my parents' house [- the source of my inner self and 2 polarities ] or call my housemate to come home early if possible. And fortunately, my housemate returned just in time SO YOU SEE THESE DIFFICULTIES ARE STILL IN A CERTAIN % AND CAN BE TRANSFORMED AS THERE IS STILL HELP, AND SUPPORT AVAILABLE, BUT THERE SHOULD BE NO MORE ESCAPISM OR IGNORANCE... On the day I had this dream early in the morning, there were some problems in Ufin (part-time job) that made me feel like I couldn't communicate with new manager and current HR department BECAUSE THE INNER GHOSTS WERE BLOCKING THE COMMUNICATION, YOU CAN MEDITATE DEEPLY ON THE SITUATION WHEN THIS HAPPENED AND TRY TO GET DEEPER IN THE INNER DIFFICULTIES THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE EXPERIENCED WHICH YOU WOULD HAVE TRIED AVOIDING AT THAT TIME, so I decided to quit my job at Ufin. And 3 days later (today), when I officially handed over all the work at Ufin, Founder of OpenLive asked to meet me privately with hope that I would contribute more to the company, as well as she will increase my bonus benefit for me. I accept to contribute more and declined the bonus benefits HERE YOU CAN SEE THE MONK ENERGY IN THE NEGATIVE, IT WAS OK TO ACCEPT THE BONUS BENEFIT AS IT WOULD HAVE BROUGHT THE FINANCIAL STABILITY THAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR AND DOING 2 JOBS.., but I thought maybe she still would AND EXPECTING AFTER REJECTING IS REPRESENTING DUALITY DEAR NHU... And during the past 2 weeks, I worked with the angel Menadel, at OpenLive in my team, there were 2 female employees who resigned. I feel Universe has continued to arrange for me to work more deeply with memories of material dependence, authority (OpenLive's minus). And I accept this BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO MAKE CONCRETE CHANGES WHEREVER AND WHENEVER POSSIBLE WITHOUT IGNORING BECAUSE ACCEPTANCE WITHOUT CHANGING OR MAKING EFFORTS TO CHANGE IS ALSO A FORM OF ESCAPISM IN REFUGE TRYING TO AVOID RESPONSIBILITIES DEAR INITIATE... Angelic thank you. A PROFOUND DREAM THAT SHOWS YOU THE MEMORIES OF DUALITY, INNER DIFFICULTIES, MATERIALISTIC NEEDS (REPRESENTED BY INNER GHOSTS) AND ESCAPISM...

title_pdf: 07 Life - 22-year friendship [2023]. last case id: C0235. PDF text: Dream date: Saturday, 1 April 2023 Angel: 19 Leuviah Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello teachers ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU I chanted Angel Leuviah with the intention that: please help me understand the memories of my old best friend HERE YOU CAN REFINE THIS QUESTION BY SAYING "WHAT ARE MY RESONANCES WITH MY OLD BEST FRIEND ?" TO GET DEEPER IN THE MEMORIES RELATED TO FRIENDSHIP THAT CREATES BLOCKAGES IN DEVELOPING UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, DETACHMENT, BALANCE IN POLARITIES ETC. I have no dreams so I will share our stories and some decode that I can understand. Phuong is my childhood friend (the one I mentioned in dream "Childhood friend"). Our mother is colleague and we were born in the same year. We go to school together. From elementary school to high school, most of the time we were in the same class. We were companions in almost everything during our childhood, from hanging out with friends, doing things together, going to extra classes, even skipping school together. When we're together, mostly Phuong will be the one to protect and support me. Even though I'm the same age, I always call Phuong an older sister. And I don't know what comes from that Phuong always protects me, protects me. Partly since I was born I have been quite thin and small, while Phuong is much taller and also has had a high degree of independence since childhood. SO HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE NEED TO FEEL PROTECTED CREATES DEPENDENCIES AND COMPLEXES RELATED TO INFERIORITY AND SUPERIORITY BECAUSE OF LACK OF UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE ALWAYS PROTECTED, EVEN IN DIFFICULT TIMES. During this time, I realized that I had no particular personality. As for me, whatever it is, I have no opinions or desires. AND THIS IS COMING FROM PAST LIVES AS A MONK WHERE YOU WERE FOCUSED ON "EMPTY YOUR MIND" Maybe when at home, my family chooses for me, and when outside, Phuong is the one to do it. Gradually, I asked myself the question: what is my personality, what do I want, what do I love. WONDERFUL SELF-QUESTIONING It's like everything I learn follows Phuong. This period may have gradually revealed the manifestations of my apathy (a major cause of my depression in recent years). YES, ALSO THIS OVER-DEPENDENCY ON OTHERS SOMEHOW CREATES A LACK OF IDENTITY, AND SELF-RECOGNITION INSIDE. Even if Phuong loves a music group, she shared it with me. I don't know if I like them or not, but then gradually when I follow this group, I engraved in my heart that I also love them and I don't really know what it is. AS IT CREATES A LACK OF DISCERNMENT. There was once when we chose a high school to attend (a big school in province or a school in Saigon - a better educational environment, so we can pass the exam to a good University). And Phuong chose to move to Saigon, while I have no idea, I just want to go away from home. And Phuong told me that if we go to different schools, our relationship will not be as close as before. And that's one of the reasons why I chose the same high school as Phuong. Even though it's a very expensive school and far from home (a boarding school in Saigon). SO HERE YOU CAN SEE THE MEMORIES OF EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES THAT CREATE A LACK OF DISCERNMENT AND AFFECT YOUR CAPACITY TO DECIDE AND TAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS. And during 3 years in high school, I gradually realized that I was almost like Phuong's shadow YES, BECAUSE OF A LACK OF SELF- ACKNOWLEDGMENT, AND SELF-IDENTITY. With everyone, we are always together, so no matter what, it will be enough just to tell Phuong, and Phuong will decide everything. And no matter what happens, Phuong will always be the one to notice me, ask about me, and take care of me first BUT THIS CREATES AN IMBALANCE DEAR NHU AS IT CREATES DEPENDENCIES. TRUE UNCONDITIONAL LOVE HELPS DEVELOP DETACHMENT, AUTONOMY AND ABOVE ALL SELF-RESPECT. HERE AS EVERYTHING IS DECIDED BY PHUONG, THIS CREATES DISCREPANCIES DEEP INSIDE YOU . And because of these consolations, I am happy and secure in Phuong's protection, I rely on Phuong, but I have overlooked some things that are important to me YES, ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS THAT YOU HAVE OVERLOOKED IS YOUR OWN INNER POTENTIAL TO DECIDE WHAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU... The universe arranged for Phuong and me to go to different senior classes, and later to different universities. I gradually had to make my own decisions, communicate with people and express myself more. I find that the way I show myself has many actions and gestures like Phuong, although inside I feel quite confident, I realize that I am only confident in a very small circle. But out of that circle, I was scared, self-deprecating and timid. YES AND THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE OVER-DEPENDENCIES ON EVERYTHING ON PHUONG... When I was at university, I was completely separated from Phuong in terms of residence, school, and circle of friends, I really had a clear space to continue to learn the lessons that the Universe arranged and reexamine the relationship with Phuong. During the 4 years, we had times when we didn't see each other. At this time, I am like a bird released from a cage, I plunge into social events, participate in many activities, jobs about starting a business, getting rich, and activities at school. While Phuong is the opposite, most Phuong rarely participates in activities, but Phuong focuses on resting, making friends, and having fun with friends. SO YOU CAN SEE HOW FOLLOWING YOUR LIFE PROGRAM CAN FREE YOU FROM THE DEPENDENCIES AND HELP YOU REALIZE YOUR OWN INNER POTENTIAL... And up to a time, Phuong told me: Phuong heard from our friends that I have changed a lot since university. They see me as a person with unlimited positive energy toward career and personal development. This is also the period when I started to have debts for investment and business to establish a business. I also did not think that I was reckless enough to dare to owe a huge amount of money when I was a student, when I could not earn much money. And especially before that, I had no concept that I needed a lot of money, before that, I was just an ordinary person and lived a normal life, with no special interests. BECAUSE THE DEPENDENCIES IN THE PAST CREATED THE OTHER EXTREME IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE FOR THE FREEDOM AND HERE THIS FREEDOM IS MORE INCLINED TOWARDS MATERIAL POSSESSIONS AND NOT THE TRUE INNER FREEDOM... IN THE PAST, YOU WERE MORE LIKE AN ANCIENT MONK WHO WAS TOO DETACHED FROM MATTER BUT THE MATERIALISTIC MEMORIES FROM EVEN DEEPER ANCIENT PAST LIVES WERE NOT ACTIVATED... When entering the Internship to prepare for graduation, I have a lot of worries about investments, my own business, debts and family, and Phuong has environmental work problems with colleagues, bosses. And Phuong came to me to share. At this time, for me, these problems I have experienced a lot and understand in depth when I have been in contact with many businesses and people outside of society. And I share Phuong my advices, but maybe because she doesn't have as much experience as me, we can't understand each other, and I feel like I can't listen to other people's problems anymore. BECAUSE EARLIER THERE WAS NO LIMIT OR BOUNDARIES IN YOUR DEPENDENCIES ON PHUONG , SO NOW THE SOUL WANTS TO HAVE THOSE BOUNDARIES, AND LIMITS IN ORDER TO PROTECT ITS INTIMACY, BUT THIS CREATES A DISTANCE AS THERE IS LESS UNDERSTANDING NOW. IN A WAY, IF YOU OBSERVE THE PATTERN AND THINK DEEPLY, YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE WAS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING EARLIER ALSO BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME PHUONG WAS DECIDING FOR YOU AND YOU WERE FOLLOWING BECAUSE OF A LACK OF INNER ASSERTION... And a few months before we graduated, I decided to end our 22-year friendship, because I don't know any better way to stop receiving problems from Phuong. Looking back now, I know I was too harsh on myself, in this relationship. Because maybe I have a very high ego inside OK..BUT THERE IS ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE ALSO THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER AND THAT IS RELATED TO THE DYNAMICS OF LACK AND COMPENSATION OF 23/07/2025, 12:13 22-year friendship | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/108424 2/3 DEPENDENCIES AND FREEDOM OF CHOICE, the Universe has arranged that during my childhood I did not have the opportunity to express myself, and when I was able to express myself, I overreacted. I also learned about 2 polarity relationships. Because during University time, Phuong once admitted to me that she was a lesbian. At that time, I don't really know how it will affect our relationship, so I just listen and let it be. SO YOU SEE THE WAY YOU USE THE WORD "SOULMATE" IN THE PERSONAL RESEARCH IS ACTUALLY SHOWING YOU THE MEMORIES OF DISCREPANCIES AND IMBALANCE IN THE POLARITIES AS NORMALLY THIS WORD SHOULD BE USED IN A COUPLE RELATIONSHIP... From my inner Phuong, I can realize that I have comparisons, low self-esteem, a tendency to be jealous when I am not valued, even bad thoughts about the person who protected me. But I know this is a lesson that the Universe has arranged for me to understand myself and realize what I need to transform. ALSO, THESE MEMORIES ARE A RESULT OF YOUR OVER-DEPENDENCIES ON PHUONG ALSO... Angelic thank you DEAR NHU, A CONCRETE SITUATION, ANY REALITY EXPERIENCED OR YOUR EXPERIENCES (REAL LIFE STORIES) CAN BE DECODED LIKE A DREAM BY MARKING IMPORTANT SIGNS AND SYMBOLS AND INTERPRETING THEM WITH PLUS, MINUS. REMEMBER A FEW OF THE IMPORTANT DIVINE LAWS THAT SAY - DREAMS ARE REALITY AND REALITY ARE DREAMS, EVERYTHING IS A SYMBOL... ANGELIC CONTINUITY WITH JELIEL & HAHAIAH ÂN

title_pdf: 08 Dream - Kasara and baby [2023]. last case id: C0236. PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 7 April 2023 Angel: 19 Leuviah Dream mood: Surprise Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello teachers ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU I continue my intention: please help me understand the memories of my old best friend. During the day SO THE DAY HERE SYMBOLICALLY REPRESENTS THE ACTION WORLD THAT HAS MEMORIES OF EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES. IT'S LIKE SOMETIMES THE DECISIONS THAT YOU MAY TAKE RELATED TO WORK/ACTION WORLD IS IMPACTED BECAUSE OF THE DISTORTED MEMORIES OF DEPENDENCIES ON OTHERS, TO PLEASE OTHERS... , on the bed SO THIS CAN HAVE AN AFFECT ON YOUR PERSONAL INTIMACY AND RECEPTIVITY, I lie in the innermost , Kasara [- a part of my feminine polarity and my emotional world: too rigid, too frank, outspoken (so straightforward that sometimes may not pay attention to the listener's feelings), lack of empathy, tolerant, overly emotionally independent, high ego, disinterested in others, tendency to judge others VERY WELL DEEPENED... AND THIS INNER KASARA CREATES LACK OF RECEPTIVITY INSIDE ] is in the middle, and the outermost is a newborn baby [- represents my future, the ability to actualize, express, motivation for the future project (boy): has a joking attitude, lacks the right seriousness, lacks concentration, protects myself OF COURSE ON ONE HAND A NEWBORN BABY SYMBOLICALLY SHOWS OF WHAT'S IN THE PREPARATION IN FUTURE, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT ALSO SIGNIFIES WHAT HAS BEEN MATERIALIZED NOW. HERE THE NEWBORN BABY ALSO INDICATES A LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY IN THE WAY YOU MATERIALIZE, WITHOUT PROPER CARE, OR THE ABILITY TO DECIDE. YOU ARE SHOWN EMOTIONAL AND OTHER FORMS OF ATTACHMENTS AND DEPENDENCIES. AND AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS TOO INTIMATE TO BE ON THE SAME BED WITH YOUR INNER KASARA, THE INNER NEWBORN BABY AND YOUR INNER HA... IT SHOWS THE DEEP NEED OF SPIRITUAL LOVE THAT YOU ARE SEEKING... ] , Ha [- she is my elder sister in reality, she is 7 months pregnant with a baby boy. She represents a part of my femininity and the emotional world: too soft, too open, too receptive, fragile, lacks ability to defend herself, lacks opinions, choices for herself, easily listen to the arrangement of others SO SYMBOLICALLY REPRESENTING YOUR FEMININE POLARITY AND IN A WAY YOUR BEHAVIOUR IN EARLIER YEARS WHEN YOU WERE WITH PHUONG AND DEPENDENT ON HER SO YOU CAN SEE HOW PROFOUND THE UNIVERSE ARRANGES DREAMS AND CERTAIN LIFE SITUATION TO LEARN FROM IT AND EVOLVE... ] 's child. The opening dream shows that I am being overly protective of myself, too secure, lacking in outward expression (my position is in the innermost). At the same time, on the outside action side, I sometimes appear too soft, fragile, to be protected, attracted attention, too open, joking. My inner Kasara in the middle is like a protective wall that I built to protect myself. HERE THE MAIN MEANING IS ABOUT WANTING TO FUSE TOO MUCH WITH OTHERS... AND THE BED IS ALSO A SYMBOL OF LAZINESS AS IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE VERY COMFORTABLE REGARDING YOUR SPIRITUAL PATH... YOU WOULD LIKE TO FEEL THE WARMTH OF LOVE... BUT IN A COMPENSATORY WAY... AND THIS WILL LEAD YOU TO CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES AS YOU OBSERVE IN THE FOLLOWING SCENE... Ha told me and Kasara to look after the baby carefully, so as not to let him fall off the bed [- lack of ability to protect oneself on social level, in intimate aspect, difficulty in expressing, actualizing, lack of concentration, sometimes having a slightly careless attitude, joking WE CAN CONNECT THIS WITH THE PART WHERE YOU SHARED IN YOUR PREVIOUS SUBMISSION HOW YOU SEE PHUONG AS SYMBOL TO PROTECT YOU THEREBY WE SEE HERE TOO MUCH DEPENDENCIES ON OTHERS THAT CAUSE DIFFICULTIES IN YOUR ACTION WORLD ALSO. ] . It seems the baby is a bit naughty. I feel a dangerous position, but I trust Kasara, so I still focus on talking to Kasara [- too much self- centeredness, lack of proper attention to my ability to express ] SO YOU CAN SEE AGAIN YOU TRUST ON SOMEONE ELSE WHEN A RESPONSIBILITY IS GIVEN TO YOU. HERE SYMBOLICALLY YOUR INNER HA GAVE A CHANCE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR INNER BABY (REPRESENTING ACTIONS) BUT THE MEMORIES OF DEPENDENCIES ARE STRONG TO BLOCK THE ABILITY TO DECIDE TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL AND DEVELOP YOUR DISCERNMENT WHEN YOU ARE IN FRONT OF SPIRITUAL PEOPLE... KASARA IS ALSO A COLLECTIVE SYMBOL THUS, SHE ALSO REPRESENTS A PART OF YOU THAT HAS THE POWER TO DIFFUSE KNOWLEDGE ON A COLLECTIVE SCALE... SO YOU SEE HERE THAT YOU CAN LACK DISCERNMENT WHEN YOU ARE IN CONTACT WITH A SPIRITUAL PROFESSOR... IT SHOWS THAT WHEN YOU BECOME SPIRITUAL, YOU CAN DEVELOP A SPIRITUAL EGO, HAVING CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES LISTENING TO OTHERS THAT HAVE AN INFERIORITY COMPLEX AND LACK OF SELF-CONFIDENCE... IT IS VERY PROFOUND TO UNDERSTAND THAT... YOU ARE SHOWN HOW YOU COULD REACT IF ONE DAY YOU BECOME A SPIRITUAL PROFESSOR... SO YOU SEE, YOU CAN GO FROM ONE EXTREME TO ANOTHER...FROM BEING FRAGILE TO BEING TOO CONFIDENT... I was too focused on protecting myself, because it was so safe that no one could interfere, and because it was so easy. And because of the lack of self-interest on the outside (expression, even appearance), my inner baby has a tendency to be disruptive, mischievous to get attention, and as natural of a baby when not cared for or guided. YES, BUT THIS WAY OF SEEING IS MORE ON THE OUTSIDE. HERE IN THIS PART, THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR YOU TO TRANSFORM THE DEPENDENCIES BUT INSTEAD, YOU CHOSE TO BE DEPENDENT... YOU CAN COMPLETE THE UNDERSTANDING WITH THE COMMENTS ABOVE... When Ha passed by, she saw that the baby was slightly rocking and seemed to be about to fall off the bed. Ha reminded myself and Kasara. At this time, Kasara hugged the baby in her arms [- This action shows that I have the ability to protect, comfort and care for my inner baby, but it is only done when prompted. And this action sometimes I just do it, not because I really care about my inner baby (shown in the saying of my inner Kasara). This shows that inside I still have a disinterest, indifference to myself and to the world around me. This probably comes because I'm too much overprotected by my inner Phuong (the old best friend I'm asking about). I rely on Phuong too much, so it can be assumed that Phuong will always protect me, so this part has created my lack of ability to protect, care and express on the outside AND BECAUSE DEEP INSIDE, YOU HAVE ALSO MEMORIES OF OVER-CONFIDENCE AND SPIRITUAL EGO... SOMETIMES YOU CAN DIMINISH YOURSELF IN ORDER TO RECEIVE ATTENTION AND COMPLIMENT... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF COURSE... ] and said that if my child died, I would not regret it HERE THIS IS ON THE EXTREME SIDE OF BEING DETACHED. THIS PART OF DREAM SHOWS YOU TO DEVELOP THE EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN ATTACHMENT AND DETACHMENT, FIRST AND FOREMOST BY UNDERSTANDING THEIR REAL MEANING AND THEN BY BEING RESPONSIBLE AND DETACHED AT THE SAME TIME BUT IT TAKES TIME DEAR NHU, FIRST IT REQUIRES WORKING ON MEMORIES OF DEPENDENCIES AND UNDERSTANDING THE MEANING OF TRUE SPIRITUAL AUTONOMY, SO THIS DREAM IS A PRECISE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION WITH HELP OF WHICH YOU CAN EMBARK OF THE BEAUTIFUL JOURNEY OF DEVELOPING A TRUE SPIRITUAL AUTONOMY... Then she put the baby inside, between herself and me. I was amazed and thinking: oh, how can Kasara be so independent, so determined and so unattached like this? [- I think too positive. The action of my inner Kasara can be interpreted in a positive sense, but here is the negative case, and that should not be with a newborn baby so should be viewed in a negative light. WELL UNDERSTOOD, IT'S MORE LIKE BEING ATTRACTED TOWARDS THE CAPACITIES OF OTHERS (LIKE BECOMING A FAN) AND THIS WAY OF SEEING OTHERS BLOCKS THE DISCERNMENT ] AND WHEN YOU HAVE THIS LINE OF CODE, IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO BE IMPRESSED BY "FALSE" SPIRITUAL PROFESSORS THAT YOU CAN EASILY ENCOUNTER NOWADAYS... YOU CAN WRONGLY PERCEIVE THE QUALITIES OF SOMEONE WHILE THE SPIRITUAL PROFESSOR IS NOT REALLY RIGHT... THAT IS WHY AT UCM, IT TAKES A MINIMUM OF 5 YEARS TO BECOME A THERAPIST... AND THEN WITH THE EXPERTISE DEGREE, THERAPISTS CAN BECOME PROFESSORS IF THEY WISH... THE TRAP FOR A SPIRITUAL PROFESSOR IS TO LET THE SPIRITUAL EGO DEVELOP... AND THE MORE YOU WILL EVOLVE AND FREE YOURSELF FROM EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES, THE MORE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THOSE PATTERNS IN YOU AND OTHERS... YOU SEE HERE THAT YOU CAN BE TOO DETACHED AND IT IS NOT GOOD EITHER... AS SAID ABOVE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP BOTH THE QUALITIES OF RESPONSIBILITY AND DETACHMENT... A moment later, Kasara was talking to me about Ha's problems. She stood next to the bed, pointed directly at Ha [- self-judge (my inner Ha), because my inner Ha is so fragile, even at times I think it can be too weak ] who was lying on the bed and holding the baby in her arms, and said: emotional dependence. AND YOU SEE HOW YOUR INNER KASARA CAN BECOME VERY INTENSE AND LACK DIPLOMACY... AND THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF SPIRITUAL EGO, BECAUSE YOUR INNER KASARA COULD HAVE SHARED PRIVATELY TO YOUR INNER HA... BUT DOING THAT IN FRONT OF OTHERS CAN BE TOO INTENSE FOR YOUR INNER HA... IT SHOWS THAT THE SPIRITUAL EGO FROM YOUR INNER KASARA CAN SOMETIMES DIMINISH OTHERS... YOU SEE THAT IF YOU ARE IN A POSITION OF TEACHING OTHERS, YOU CAN LACK LOVE AND BE TOO DIRECT, YOU CAN LACK DIPLOMACY... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... AND REMEMBER ALSO, THIS DREAM IS HAPPENING IN ONE OF THE MOST INTIMATE PLACE, IT MEANS THAT THOSE MEMORIES ARE STILL WITHIN YOU AND PROBABLY NOT MANIFESTED ON THE CONCRETE LEVEL... BECAUSE YOU COULD ACT CONCRETELY VERY DIFFERENTLY AS A FRAGILE AND SHY PERSON BUT INSIDE, YOU CAN FEEL THE SUPERIORITY COMPLEX, THE NEED TO TEACH OTHERS, MIXED WITH EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES AND 23/07/2025, 12:14 Kasara and baby | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/108818 2/3 THE NEED OF RECOGNITION... THAT BEING SAID, YOU NEED TO ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT A DREAM IS A PERCENTAGE OF YOU... IT IS NOT THE WHOLE YOU YOU HAVE WONDERFUL QUALITIES WITHIN YOU... I followed Kasara's hand pointing at Ha and was a bit surprised. THIS SURPRISING ENDING IS HOWEVER NOT POSITIVE BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL MEMORIES THAT BLOCK THE RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TOWARDS SELF... I have a certain % that can judge others, based on the spiritual knowledge I have learned, I can see a % of what knowledge I am relying on to be able to tend to want to teach others. Perhaps the fact that I have found myself tending to judge others, however, here my surprise at the fact that my inner Kasara was the one to speak out shows that I still lack humility, too knowledgeable, and use the knowledge they know to believe that I am superior to others and have the ability to judge people. IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE THE HUMILITY IN DESCRIBING THE SITUATION... IT IS VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD... The dream also made clear the answer I asked about the resonances with my old best friend: emotional dependence. NOT ONLY EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES BUT OTHERS MEMORIES THAT ARE DESCRIBED ABOVE... And having 3 women in my dream shows that I have built my inner self (Angel 3 Sitael) in these memories since childhood (Phuong is my best friend and Ha is my biological elder sister outside in real life). WELL DECODED During working with Angel Leuviah this week, I feel my physical body is quite tired, sluggish, lethargic, I have a sore throat and a little nausea (manifestations like having a cold). At the same time this week I am also in the new phase of going to the gym, so maybe these events, which are similar to this dream, show me about illness, lack of ability to protect myself outside (weak physical body). BUT ALSO AN ABILITY TO WORK ON THE MEMORIES OF EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES TOO. REMEMBER AS THIS IS A DREAM, IT IS SHOWING YOU A %, YOU ALSO HAVE WONDERFUL QUALITIES DEAR NHU THAT ACTUALLY HELPED YOU TO GET A PRECISE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IN THIS DREAM... When I reflect on myself, during the last time I worked at the company, I realized that my ability to express myself (talk, give opinions and act) was quite weak. In most of the meetings, I keep silent, listen and act WHILE INSIDE YOU HAVE PROBABLY, AT TIMES, YOUR INNER KASARA THAT IS INTENSE OR CRITICIZING CERTAIN ACTIONS , however, recently the results of the implementation have been unsatisfactory and always need to be revised. I've been thinking back to myself for the past 2-3 years, at work (jobs that carry energy fueled by excessive material needs, authority, feminine tends to dominate, masculine sometimes a bit soft), I feel like I'm stuck, not able to show my full potential like before. I also tried, but failed. Perhaps in myself, there is resistance, self-limitation, and self-protection against the desire to receive these energies (in the direction of denial). SOMETIMES WHEN THERE ARE MEMORIES OF EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES OR ANY OTHER FORM OF DEPENDENCIES IT CAN RESULT IN LOW SELF-CONFIDENCE VERSUS OVER-CONFIDENCE... . THIS CAN CREATE DIFFICULTIES IN ACTIONS, BECAUSE OF A SENSE OF ENSURING PROTECTION ALL THE TIME, MEMORIES OF PLEASING OTHERS IN ORDER TO BE IN THEIR GOOD BOOKS, EGO IN CERTAIN % THINKING THAT OTHERS WON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAY/EXPRESS, PLAYING SAFE ALL THE TIME, ETC MAKES YOU FEEL STUCK, BUT WITH A DREAM LIKE THIS ANSWERING DIRECTLY, PRECISELY AND GUIDING YOU TOWARDS THE CAUSE CAN HELP YOU RE-GAIN THAT SELF- CONFIDENCE AND HUMILITY BACK DEAR NHU.

PDF text: Dream date: Friday, 7 April 2023 Angel: 19 Leuviah Dream mood: Surprise Dream and Analysis: Angelic hello teachers ANGELIC HELLO DEAR NHU I continue my intention: please help me understand the memories of my old best friend. During the day SO THE DAY HERE SYMBOLICALLY REPRESENTS THE ACTION WORLD THAT HAS MEMORIES OF EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES. IT'S LIKE SOMETIMES THE DECISIONS THAT YOU MAY TAKE RELATED TO WORK/ACTION WORLD IS IMPACTED BECAUSE OF THE DISTORTED MEMORIES OF DEPENDENCIES ON OTHERS, TO PLEASE OTHERS... , on the bed SO THIS CAN HAVE AN AFFECT ON YOUR PERSONAL INTIMACY AND RECEPTIVITY, I lie in the innermost , Kasara [- a part of my feminine polarity and my emotional world: too rigid, too frank, outspoken (so straightforward that sometimes may not pay attention to the listener's feelings), lack of empathy, tolerant, overly emotionally independent, high ego, disinterested in others, tendency to judge others VERY WELL DEEPENED...

HERE THE NEWBORN BABY ALSO INDICATES A LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY IN THE WAY YOU MATERIALIZE, WITHOUT PROPER CARE, OR THE ABILITY TO DECIDE. YOU ARE SHOWN EMOTIONAL AND OTHER FORMS OF ATTACHMENTS AND DEPENDENCIES. AND AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS TOO INTIMATE TO BE ON THE SAME BED WITH YOUR INNER KASARA, THE INNER NEWBORN BABY AND YOUR INNER HA... IT SHOWS THE DEEP NEED OF SPIRITUAL LOVE THAT YOU ARE SEEKING... ] , Ha [- she is my elder sister in reality, she is 7 months pregnant with a baby boy. She represents a part of my femininity and the emotional world: too soft, too open, too receptive, fragile, lacks ability to defend herself, lacks opinions, choices for herself, easily listen to the arrangement of others SO SYMBOLICALLY REPRESENTING YOUR FEMININE POLARITY AND IN A WAY YOUR BEHAVIOUR IN EARLIER YEARS WHEN YOU WERE WITH PHUONG AND DEPENDENT ON HER SO YOU CAN SEE HOW PROFOUND THE UNIVERSE ARRANGES DREAMS AND CERTAIN LIFE SITUATION TO LEARN FROM IT AND EVOLVE... ] 's child. The opening dream shows that I am being overly protective of myself, too secure, lacking in outward expression (my position is in the innermost). At the same time, on the outside action side, I sometimes appear too soft, fragile, to be protected, attracted attention, too open, joking. My inner Kasara in the middle is like a protective wall that I built to protect myself. HERE THE MAIN MEANING IS ABOUT WANTING TO FUSE TOO MUCH WITH OTHERS... AND THE BED IS ALSO A SYMBOL OF LAZINESS AS IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE VERY COMFORTABLE REGARDING YOUR SPIRITUAL PATH... YOU WOULD LIKE TO FEEL THE WARMTH OF LOVE... BUT IN A COMPENSATORY WAY... AND THIS WILL LEAD YOU TO CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES AS YOU OBSERVE IN THE FOLLOWING SCENE... Ha told me and Kasara to look after the baby carefully, so as not to let him fall off the bed [- lack of ability to protect oneself on social level, in intimate aspect, difficulty in expressing, actualizing, lack of concentration, sometimes having a slightly careless attitude, joking WE CAN CONNECT THIS WITH THE PART WHERE YOU SHARED IN YOUR PREVIOUS SUBMISSION HOW YOU SEE PHUONG AS SYMBOL TO PROTECT YOU THEREBY WE SEE HERE TOO MUCH DEPENDENCIES ON OTHERS THAT CAUSE DIFFICULTIES IN YOUR ACTION WORLD ALSO. ] . It seems the baby is a bit naughty. I feel a dangerous position, but I trust Kasara, so I still focus on talking to Kasara [- too much self- centeredness, lack of proper attention to my ability to express ] SO YOU CAN SEE AGAIN YOU TRUST ON SOMEONE ELSE WHEN A RESPONSIBILITY IS GIVEN TO YOU. HERE SYMBOLICALLY YOUR INNER HA GAVE A CHANCE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR INNER BABY (REPRESENTING ACTIONS) BUT THE MEMORIES OF DEPENDENCIES ARE STRONG TO BLOCK THE ABILITY TO DECIDE TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL AND DEVELOP YOUR DISCERNMENT WHEN YOU ARE IN FRONT OF SPIRITUAL PEOPLE... KASARA IS ALSO A COLLECTIVE SYMBOL THUS, SHE ALSO REPRESENTS A PART OF YOU THAT HAS THE POWER TO DIFFUSE KNOWLEDGE ON A COLLECTIVE SCALE... SO YOU SEE HERE THAT YOU CAN LACK DISCERNMENT WHEN YOU ARE IN CONTACT WITH A SPIRITUAL PROFESSOR... IT SHOWS THAT WHEN YOU BECOME SPIRITUAL, YOU CAN DEVELOP A SPIRITUAL EGO, HAVING CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES LISTENING TO OTHERS THAT HAVE AN INFERIORITY COMPLEX AND LACK OF SELF-CONFIDENCE... IT IS VERY PROFOUND TO UNDERSTAND THAT... YOU ARE SHOWN HOW YOU COULD REACT IF ONE DAY YOU BECOME A SPIRITUAL PROFESSOR... SO YOU SEE, YOU CAN GO FROM ONE EXTREME TO ANOTHER...FROM BEING FRAGILE TO BEING TOO CONFIDENT... I was too focused on protecting myself, because it was so safe that no one could interfere, and because it was so easy. And because of the lack of self-interest on the outside (expression, even appearance), my inner baby has a tendency to be disruptive, mischievous to get attention, and as natural of a baby when not cared for or guided. YES, BUT THIS WAY OF SEEING IS MORE ON THE OUTSIDE. HERE IN THIS PART, THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR YOU TO TRANSFORM THE DEPENDENCIES BUT INSTEAD, YOU CHOSE TO BE DEPENDENT... YOU CAN COMPLETE THE UNDERSTANDING WITH THE COMMENTS ABOVE... When Ha passed by, she saw that the baby was slightly rocking and seemed to be about to fall off the bed. Ha reminded myself and Kasara. At this time, Kasara hugged the baby in her arms [- This action shows that I have the ability to protect, comfort and care for my inner baby, but it is only done when prompted. And this action sometimes I just do it, not because I really care about my inner baby (shown in the saying of my inner Kasara). This shows that inside I still have a disinterest, indifference to myself and to the world around me. This probably comes because I'm too much overprotected by my inner Phuong (the old best friend I'm asking about). I rely on Phuong too much, so it can be assumed that Phuong will always protect me, so this part has created my lack of ability to protect, care and express on the outside AND BECAUSE DEEP INSIDE, YOU HAVE ALSO MEMORIES OF OVER-CONFIDENCE AND SPIRITUAL EGO... SOMETIMES YOU CAN DIMINISH YOURSELF IN ORDER TO RECEIVE ATTENTION AND COMPLIMENT... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF COURSE... ] and said that if my child died, I would not regret it HERE THIS IS ON THE EXTREME SIDE OF BEING DETACHED. THIS PART OF DREAM SHOWS YOU TO DEVELOP THE EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN ATTACHMENT AND DETACHMENT, FIRST AND FOREMOST BY UNDERSTANDING THEIR REAL MEANING AND THEN BY BEING RESPONSIBLE AND DETACHED AT THE SAME TIME BUT IT TAKES TIME DEAR NHU, FIRST IT REQUIRES WORKING ON MEMORIES OF DEPENDENCIES AND UNDERSTANDING THE MEANING OF TRUE SPIRITUAL AUTONOMY, SO THIS DREAM IS A PRECISE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION WITH HELP OF WHICH YOU CAN EMBARK OF THE BEAUTIFUL JOURNEY OF DEVELOPING A TRUE SPIRITUAL AUTONOMY... Then she put the baby inside, between herself and me. I was amazed and thinking: oh, how can Kasara be so independent, so determined and so unattached like this? [- I think too positive. The action of my inner Kasara can be interpreted in a positive sense, but here is the negative case, and that should not be with a newborn baby so should be viewed in a negative light. WELL UNDERSTOOD, IT'S MORE LIKE BEING ATTRACTED TOWARDS THE CAPACITIES OF OTHERS (LIKE BECOMING A FAN) AND THIS WAY OF SEEING OTHERS BLOCKS THE DISCERNMENT ] AND WHEN YOU HAVE THIS LINE OF CODE, IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO BE IMPRESSED BY "FALSE" SPIRITUAL PROFESSORS THAT YOU CAN EASILY ENCOUNTER NOWADAYS... YOU CAN WRONGLY PERCEIVE THE QUALITIES OF SOMEONE WHILE THE SPIRITUAL PROFESSOR IS NOT REALLY RIGHT... THAT IS WHY AT UCM, IT TAKES A MINIMUM OF 5 YEARS TO BECOME A THERAPIST... AND THEN WITH THE EXPERTISE DEGREE, THERAPISTS CAN BECOME PROFESSORS IF THEY WISH... THE TRAP FOR A SPIRITUAL PROFESSOR IS TO LET THE SPIRITUAL EGO DEVELOP... AND THE MORE YOU WILL EVOLVE AND FREE YOURSELF FROM EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES, THE MORE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THOSE PATTERNS IN YOU AND OTHERS... YOU SEE HERE THAT YOU CAN BE TOO DETACHED AND IT IS NOT GOOD EITHER... AS SAID ABOVE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP BOTH THE QUALITIES OF RESPONSIBILITY AND DETACHMENT... A moment later, Kasara was talking to me about Ha's problems. She stood next to the bed, pointed directly at Ha [- self-judge (my inner Ha), because my inner Ha is so fragile, even at times I think it can be too weak ] who was lying on the bed and holding the baby in her arms, and said: emotional dependence. AND YOU SEE HOW YOUR INNER KASARA CAN BECOME VERY INTENSE AND LACK DIPLOMACY... AND THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF SPIRITUAL EGO, BECAUSE YOUR INNER KASARA COULD HAVE SHARED PRIVATELY TO YOUR INNER HA... BUT DOING THAT IN FRONT OF OTHERS CAN BE TOO INTENSE FOR YOUR INNER HA... IT SHOWS THAT THE SPIRITUAL EGO FROM YOUR INNER KASARA CAN SOMETIMES DIMINISH OTHERS... YOU SEE THAT IF YOU ARE IN A POSITION OF TEACHING OTHERS, YOU CAN LACK LOVE AND BE TOO DIRECT, YOU CAN LACK DIPLOMACY... IN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE... AND REMEMBER ALSO, THIS DREAM IS HAPPENING IN ONE OF THE MOST INTIMATE PLACE, IT MEANS THAT THOSE MEMORIES ARE STILL WITHIN YOU AND PROBABLY NOT MANIFESTED ON THE CONCRETE LEVEL... BECAUSE YOU COULD ACT CONCRETELY VERY DIFFERENTLY AS A FRAGILE AND SHY PERSON BUT INSIDE, YOU CAN FEEL THE SUPERIORITY COMPLEX, THE NEED TO TEACH OTHERS, MIXED WITH EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES AND 23/07/2025, 12:14 Kasara and baby | DSSI Portal - Universe/City Mikaël https://dssi.ucm.ca/en/dream/108818 2/3 THE NEED OF RECOGNITION... THAT BEING SAID, YOU NEED TO ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT A DREAM IS A PERCENTAGE OF YOU... IT IS NOT THE WHOLE YOU YOU HAVE WONDERFUL QUALITIES WITHIN YOU... I followed Kasara's hand pointing at Ha and was a bit surprised. THIS SURPRISING ENDING IS HOWEVER NOT POSITIVE BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL MEMORIES THAT BLOCK THE RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TOWARDS SELF... I have a certain % that can judge others, based on the spiritual knowledge I have learned, I can see a % of what knowledge I am relying on to be able to tend to want to teach others. Perhaps the fact that I have found myself tending to judge others, however, here my surprise at the fact that my inner Kasara was the one to speak out shows that I still lack humility, too knowledgeable, and use the knowledge they know to believe that I am superior to others and have the ability to judge people. IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE THE HUMILITY IN DESCRIBING THE SITUATION... IT IS VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD... The dream also made clear the answer I asked about the resonances with my old best friend: emotional dependence. NOT ONLY EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES BUT OTHERS MEMORIES THAT ARE DESCRIBED ABOVE... And having 3 women in my dream shows that I have built my inner self (Angel 3 Sitael) in these memories since childhood (Phuong is my best friend and Ha is my biological elder sister outside in real life). WELL DECODED During working with Angel Leuviah this week, I feel my physical body is quite tired, sluggish, lethargic, I have a sore throat and a little nausea (manifestations like having a cold). At the same time this week I am also in the new phase of going to the gym, so maybe these events, which are similar to this dream, show me about illness, lack of ability to protect myself outside (weak physical body). BUT ALSO AN ABILITY TO WORK ON THE MEMORIES OF EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES TOO. REMEMBER AS THIS IS A DREAM, IT IS SHOWING YOU A %, YOU ALSO HAVE WONDERFUL QUALITIES DEAR NHU THAT ACTUALLY HELPED YOU TO GET A PRECISE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IN THIS DREAM... When I reflect on myself, during the last time I worked at the company, I realized that my ability to express myself (talk, give opinions and act) was quite weak. In most of the meetings, I keep silent, listen and act WHILE INSIDE YOU HAVE PROBABLY, AT TIMES, YOUR INNER KASARA THAT IS INTENSE OR CRITICIZING CERTAIN ACTIONS , however, recently the results of the implementation have been unsatisfactory and always need to be revised. I've been thinking back to myself for the past 2-3 years, at work (jobs that carry energy fueled by excessive material needs, authority, feminine tends to dominate, masculine sometimes a bit soft), I feel like I'm stuck, not able to show my full potential like before. I also tried, but failed. Perhaps in myself, there is resistance, self-limitation, and self-protection against the desire to receive these energies (in the direction of denial). SOMETIMES WHEN THERE ARE MEMORIES OF EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCIES OR ANY OTHER FORM OF DEPENDENCIES IT CAN RESULT IN LOW SELF-CONFIDENCE VERSUS OVER-CONFIDENCE... . THIS CAN CREATE DIFFICULTIES IN ACTIONS, BECAUSE OF A SENSE OF ENSURING PROTECTION ALL THE TIME, MEMORIES OF PLEASING OTHERS IN ORDER TO BE IN THEIR GOOD BOOKS, EGO IN CERTAIN % THINKING THAT OTHERS WON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAY/EXPRESS, PLAYING SAFE ALL THE TIME, ETC MAKES YOU FEEL STUCK, BUT WITH A DREAM LIKE THIS ANSWERING DIRECTLY, PRECISELY AND GUIDING YOU TOWARDS THE CAUSE CAN HELP YOU RE-GAIN THAT SELF- CONFIDENCE AND HUMILITY BACK DEAR NHU. IF YOU WISH, YOU CAN WORK WITH ANGEL 27 YERATHEL, TO REGAIN CONFIDENCE BACK IN YOUR DECISIONS...
