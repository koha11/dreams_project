file: A weird proposal; last dream id: D0000; Date of dream: Tuesday, February 15, 2022 Angel: 18 Caliel State of mind: Surprised, Angry, Afraid, Disappoited Dream and analysis: Good morning, my professor and assistant professor! Thank you for guiding me on this journey. I worked with the angel Caliel with the important question: "Is my boyfriend a husband fit for my developing quality" (I have asked it for two months) Here is my first dream: My boyfriend and I came back to his home - not his present house. His family had dinner but we have not eaten . I prepared the meal for both of us. His younger sister showed me the place to take the food. The preparation was nearly completed with a lack of fish sauce so he was taking it. I went down to the ground floor while he was on the high floor . Then he finished making fish sauce, I went up without his call. When I am on the highest floor, he and my old girlfriend swinged down by rope and he dropped the friend off. He intended to ask me to marry but I was at the beginning position and I was looking down. The second dream: "I was attacked by a white strong light from both sides when I ran after a friend I could not open my eyes . I did Tai Chi weakly before I fainted." I am too strict on myself, it prevents me from receiving the reality related to 2 polarities. The third dream: " My friend, Y and I discovered a white strange paint stain falling down from the roof when my paternal family gathered to celebrate flew down to find us but we escaped so it flew away. A next scene, a white paint stain from the roof fell down on some children , they just dissolved, a big creature attacked, luckily a man hit the creature and it disappeared. A next scent, when the family gathered in the attic , my mother and I saw a paint stain, and I announced dissolving immediately. Everyone except I and Y ran to the door . We hid to the back, jumped to other roofs to hide and find the signal of the creature. Some of the adults also found it when he was preparing to attack but it ran away in our way. I was protected by my cousin when I was on the roof. Then, I was on the way back home . I have just been on a bridge then a big water flowed and brought a big shark . I held the bridge and pretended to die and escaped. When I was at home, I decided to pick my lover up to my house to have dinner. His home is in a military area . It used to be a school where I spent my time when I was a child. I guaranteed to protect him and I believed I can do it. When I crossed the military school, it was a big wind but I still took him to his home." Third dream is "I was in a class and prepared for an examination . A woman teacher guided me using a cow replace a pig for the examination ." Fourth dream is " a registration of marriage " There are some memories let me leave off the spiritual way. Fifth dream is "I, Oanh Quang , Nguyen and some friends gathered at a place on a floor to chat and then moved to a party . We needed to walk to the party. The street was like a street coming to . There were. many groups dressed in different clothes . I was suddenly called from a group. The group is 3 girls wearing hoodies . I was invited to dance together with them on the platform. Then I moved to another place. All my friends disappeared . I knew they were coming back in the first place, I was waiting for them in anger. After a long time, they rode across me to leave." Thank you very much.

file: Binh Yen Noi campsite; last dream id: D0006; Date of dream: Thursday, May 5, 2022 Angel: 9 Haziel State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana Wish you have a nice day!!! This period time, I continue focusing to the question: "Is my present job still suitable for my life program?" I received some dreams from the Up-Above but I cannot remember. My company has a big change in the next time. My boss confirmed to sell our company. I can continue working at the present position. The new owner will invest and expand the company with a big mission. Is it a good sign for myself? I have not met the new owner. My manager told me the new owner was a rich group. Buying our company is just a small project. The company can join to a supply chain with other companies in the group. I think I should ask the Up Above to have an answer more clearly. I also noted a dream this week as below: 1. I came to Binh Yen Noi - in English, it means a peace place where I and my friends went camping as I told you in last dream journal. I came to take a birthday cake ..I reserved. 2. I was on the way coming to my company. I try a new way. I went up following 2 young men They gave up when they were in the middle of a slope. I felt the way was not right but I still wanted to try. I went to the highest of the slope and saw Binh Yen Noi . I told the waiter I was lost, he guided me went down because of no other ways. will be late at my work. I tried to run to my company . The company was in a building. I forgot bringing the elevator card I ran to the elevator and received the help from the guards. Coming in the company, I saw two men who were threatening me There were a man who we had a deep relationship and a man who I was in a love relationship. They were protecting me . Duyen Thank you

file: Vegetable Rows in a House; last dream id: D0008; Date of dream: Wednesday, April 2, 2025 Angel: 15 Hariel State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle, I would like to analyze this dream as below: I saw vegetable rows in a house , and I want to water them. There were Vy and Sao . I pulled the hose to water them, and had to go around in all sorts of ways. I also met a female water seller in front of the house, who didn't want me to pull the hose through her position because she felt it was quite annoying. She still let me pass. AS SAID ABOVE, Everyone told me to water them too much . The seller accidentally had an unexpected event at home and needed money. , so she asked Sao if he could pay back some of the money he owed. He went in and took out some of the water bottles to pay. That morning, before going to work, I dropped a small bottle of perfume on the ground. The bottle did not break, but a little spilled out. I did not realize that the perfume had spilled into the box of vegetables I cooked to bring to the company to eat. When I analyzed my dream, I asked myself how emotions ("water") can nourish emotions ("vegetables"). I did not realize that point consciously and it's time to work on that. It shows that I think too much more than I feel. Emotions are something that I have, but I didn't know how to nourish them. That is the reason why I am at the intellectual level more than at the emotional level. Sometimes, I just find a way to adjust my thoughts and then adjust my feelings. I also see that I do not notice my feelings enough, but I can discern my thoughts when it has a problem. This is one of the reasons making me have difficulty analyzing this dream. I asked myself: "How am I nourishing my emotions? Are emotions important to me?" There were some confusions in me for this topic. I realize that I am trying to go deeply into a topic instead of ignoring that. Thank you Duyen Reviewer's Message: A lovely hello Ân, I would like to share this interpretation with you, it took me a while to do it and I'm not completely sure. Angélique gratitude, Danièle 🙏🌸

file: A deny to connect; last dream id: D0009; Date of dream: Saturday, April 12, 2025 Angel: 44 Yelahiah State of mind: Uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle, I am so touched when I read your revision. Everything is synchronicity when I am working on my emotions with Angel Damabiah, then I receive your revisions. They help me understand myself at the emotional level. , I am on the Besides journey to research a scholarship to learn a Master's in Supply Chain Management in Europe. I want to dive deeply into the major. I have an intention to develop my patience, concentration, and perseverance. Because I discovered that I used to give up many times in learning English, it showed my difficulties in manifestation, and this year, I would like to understand it deeply. I spend every day writing down any subject like a journal, and I see myself giving many reasons not to do things, and I could persuade myself to do my best. I asked myself why I do not write down the beautiful things and the improved things I learned instead of giving up. The resistance is big and I need more time to understand it, coming from and transforming. When I practiced Yana breathing, I felt so heavy in my heart chakra. I tried to breathe through the heaviness, and at the end of this practice, I felt softer and had a strange feeling at my third chakra. I also heard a voice that why I need to force myself to breathe like this, I need to love myself, and do the soft things. I heard this voice many times, when I wanted to learn English deeply after working. The voice told me that I was forcing myself, I needed to respect my rhythm, so I do not make efforts, and I need to change to relax. And I also see my fear that I am not qualified enough to learn a Master's with a scholarship. But this time, I would like to learn to manifest in the right way, so I continue searching, learning English, and listening to Up Above's guidance through my dream and my concrete life. I was recently reminded by a DSSI friend that the spiritual journey is autonomy, I should be careful not to have a dependency on Up Above like I pray, but I do not move my feet. I would like to analyze a dream when I invoked the Angel Yelahiah - my emotional birth angel and I would like to understand why I refuse to face a conflict: I sat down with Ai somewhere. I needed to contact Bang Tuyen urgently in my hometown, because I was careless and gave the wrong information to Tuyen. When Ai knew my fault, she was very angry and required me to fix it immediately. She even started calling and gave the phone to me. But on the other side, some people were joking, so they did not reply . I was uncomfortable, and I asked her to turn off the call, and I would call again later. The previous morning, Ai was a person who asked me whether my relationship with my ex-boyfriend continued or not. Because she and another female friend wanted to kick him out of my friends' chat group that we had been added to. I said he and I stopped, and she could do what she wanted. I asked myself if it was right. He came to my friends' group, but he can be our friend even though he and I broke up. I think I am growing more and more when I improve my concentration and patience in doing the right things. Of course, it can not lack love, but it also has to have the right rigor. Thank you Duyen Reviewer's Message: A lovely hello, An, thank you for your help and comments. I would like to send you this review, as well as for the advice given. Angelic thoughts, Danielle 🙏

file: Nourishing a Right Love; last dream id: D0010; Date of dream: Thursday, May 1, 2025 Angel: 22 Yeiayel State of mind: Comfortable Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle, I came home for a 4-day holiday and I am working with Angel Yeiayel. I would like to analyze my dream: I was sitting in a restaurant . There were two friends sitting in front of us and turning around to talk to us and two male friends sitting to my left. While we were there, I overheard something about an upcoming birthday but I wasn't sure whose it was. I also listened to some bad news but I couldn't remember. Eventually, a birthday cake appeared, and we all celebrated— it turned out to be for the male friend beside me, whose nickname was " Mouse ". Another male friend joined in, pretending it was his birthday too, making everyone laugh. The atmosphere was joyful, and the male friend next to me—who felt like my boyfriend —was gentle and kind and I felt a warm connection between us. Later, the other male friend mentioned that he liked cheerful work, like the kind I do, and asked me to let him know if I heard of any similar job opportunities. That day, I met with some friends who are now very busy with their children. Even though they came to a gathering, they couldn't spend much time with the group. One of my friends called me by an ugly name many times, this time, I stood up for myself and told him not to speak to me that way, but he continued, and it exhausted me. During a short conversation, he asked what I had learned from DSSI and how I could prove my level. I felt uncomfortable. I didn't feel it was the right time or place to explain what I had learned, especially since he seemed focused only on concrete results. I refused to go into detail and kept evolving his questions, though apart from me feared that might damage our friendship. Finally, one of my friends wanted to share something she was passionate about and asked me to listen. But I started to sense that some of what she shared didn't feel right to me—it seemed to deny something negative or even harmful. I felt conflicted. I didn't think she would accept my perspective. I'm still unsure what the right thing is—for me or for her. I know she means well and wants to help, but I also know I need to be true to what I've learned and believe. Additionally, I hurt my right thumb twice recently, which reminded me how easy it is to judge others without seeing the full picture. Maybe what we see as someone's mistake is actually tied to a deeper story—or even karma from past lives. This helped me remember not to judge others. Coming home and observing the way my parents live I understand that there are some renunciations I should do deeply on myself and change myself, not changing others. THANK YOU Duyen Reviewer's Message: A lovely hello, An. I'd like to send you this review for the advice you gave. Thank you for your help; I'm learning a lot of practical things with Duyen.

file: ; last dream id: D0011; Date of dream: Thursday, May 15, 2025 Angel: 57 Nemamiah State of mind: Uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle, I would like to analyze the dreams I received in one night when I asked the Up Above if I chose to learn a Master's in a foreign country, is right for my evolution: Dream 1 : I lived in an unknown place, and my sister-in-law 's house was located on the main road. To see my niece, Cat, I passed by and looked into. Dream 2 : When I lived with a friend In my countryside, . I unintentionally scared a male friend who felt I was harassing him. I didn't explain because I mistakenly thought it was just because he was handsome. Dream 3: I was sitting at the dining table with Quang , Hoang . Then Oanh came in and wanted me to decode her dream. Hoang's attitude is very unpleasant. Dream 4 : Phap and another friend cycled past where I lived. I've also felt more connected to the love I receive in my life. For example, when some colleagues made mistakes, I initially felt frustrated and thought they should have been more careful. But instead of reacting, I stayed calm and shared my point of view gently. I've become more aware that I'm working with human beings, not robots, and that awareness makes me feel more connected to them. My mother recently reminded me that while I can be a vegetarian, I should consider eating what others eat in social situations, so I can be more easily accepted. At first, I might have resisted this advice, but now I understand it came from a place of love and concern. She's worried about me, and I no longer feel the need to argue like I used to. Instead, I appreciate her perspective and even encourage her to take care of her own health, especially since she was unhappy at the time. I respect the rhythm of my family and the wisdom it brings. I feel happy and softer than before. Of course, I'm still working on my insecurities — especially the desire for love and attention from others — but I'm starting to see that everything I seek already exists within me. And I'm learning to recognize and trust that more each day. THANK YOU Duyen Reviewer's Message: A beautiful hello Ân, Short dreams, very subtle, for his guidance. I didn't note the niece's name "Cat", I imagine she dreams in Vietnamese, to avoid creating a judgment. Even if in the next dream we still see a bit of cat-like behavior. Angélique gratitude 🙏🌸, Danièle

file: Restructure; last dream id: D0015; Date of dream: Friday, May 30, 2025 Angel: 68 Habuhiah Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle This week, I achieved significant efficiency by restructuring my coffee business. A team member suggested a better salary, prompting me to reconsider. After discussions with my boss and manager, I implemented a new KPI and Revenue structure for my coffee team, offering increased bonuses for goal achievement. Other new structures were also introduced. While not exactly what she expected, it confirmed I had listened to her concerns. I reflected on why this weighed so heavily on me, realizing my appreciation for her efforts in the store. However, I recognized a need to improve how I manifest my intentions. I must commit to following my structure, including random task evaluations, which will offer a new perspective to the team. I need to act more as a manager and less as just a guide. I accept who I am and will do my best. I also found myself frustrated with a supplier who repeatedly made the same mistake. Attempts to explain were met with refusal, leading to monthly errors. I realized my energy is stronger now, and I questioned whether I could change her or if a different approach would yield better results. I need to use the right energy to communicate with her. I felt paralyzed when I realized I only had a week to submit my exercises. While I made progress this month—preparing the PR early, the Source Code in the middle, and the Angelica Yantra at the beginning—leaving me with less work, I was still exhausted this week. To counter this, I dedicated one evening to meditation and relaxation, simply lying down without doing anything. I understand this exhaustion is an accumulation of memories, and I am learning to transform them. I would like to analyze this dream: The large campus featured a study area and a residential zone, divided by a stream. I ARRIVED early, hoping to rent a temporary room for a nap However, upon entering the right building , I found every room occupied. I spoke with the female manager , alongside two other girls, also seeking accommodation. She informed me that rooms were only rented monthly and that this was the male section. She then led the two girls to the female area across the way. I sensed her discomfort with my presence, but thankfully, one of the girls pulled me along. On the other side, the other male manager said something like There were no rooms available. I saw Ngan there, though she seemed unfamiliar. Then I left. I stopped by the food court and ran into several old friends, both male and female, whom I hadn't seen in a while. They were enjoying themselves at the counter, picking out food, chatting before heading off. I was in another scene, like in a class, and there was a reaction related to lightning . I recently had a dream where I was driving my ex-boyfriend to his company, making a right turn. It felt like a stark reminder that I'm repeating old patterns. I spoke to him that he should be the one driving me. This dream makes me think about how recently I am trying to make myself in work, I have a fear that if I do not do anything, I will be like a die, I will go down, I will not develop. So even when I want to watch something, I use the English video to help me learn it and become familiar with it. I think I can give myself a little time for breaking to breathe and doing the mantra. Relaxing in the right way is a good thing for my evolution. When I think about the symbol of my boyfriend in my dream, I realize that he is a part of me and he spends most of his time working. Even when his work is over, he can cut all of his time to just work and some basic activities for a long time. He just spent a little time on our relationship after he arranged for his sport, his party with his colleagues. I accept that he needs to relax when he works a lot like that. But his balance is not easy, even though he rarely calls his family. He thinks that he should earn money for the future of my parents, but when he comes back to his home with his family, he spends most of the time gathering and drinking beer. His mother told me that he did not share anything." This dream resonated with something I learned from a video about a book, which described a teacher asking four-year-old students if they wanted to repeat the same lesson or try something new. A portion of them chose the familiar option, and I realized I have a similar tendency to stick with what's comfortable, indicating a difficulty in embracing new challenges to learn step by step. Thank you Duyen Reviewer's Message: A lovely hello, Ân. I'm sorry to send you so many validations; I do it less often for other students. Angélique, gratitude, Danièle

file: A Box of Butterflies; last dream id: D0018; Date of dream: Saturday, June 7, 2025 Angel: 44 Yelahiah Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle Initially, I read this dream in Vietnamese in my journal, but I couldn't understand what happened, so I chose something else. However, when I returned to select a dream again, I understood this one and would like to analyze it. There's something crucial I need to grasp because while working with my emotional birth angel Yelahiah, I've noticed continued resistance. I even avoid sleeping well and struggle to remember my dreams in detail. My friends came over to my place, including Dieu and her second son , who could already talk, plus two or three other friends . We were doing something when her son wanted to leave . I went to the convenience store to buy something. Then I called a ride for her and her son. When the car arrived, she and her sat in the back with a large car seat . They sat next to another passenger. The car dropped that person off first, then her and her son. After I got back and we continued hanging out, I suddenly remembered I had a meeting at 2 PM that I'd completely forgotten about. A friend even messaged me asking why I wasn't online. I thought to myself, if I'd remembered, I wouldn't have been goofing around like this. Then I noticed the bedroom had a display box on the wall filled with butterflies and other winged insects I'd forgotten to clean it out. Before I could even touch it, they all flew out. This week, I've been reflecting on my struggle with sharing and having deep conversations, one of my ex-boyfriend symbol's distortions that I had a resonance with. Diving deeper, I realized a root cause lies in my childhood: during a conflict with my brother, my mom told me to "keep silent, don't say anything." This left me crying uncontrollably, trying to make no sound. This experience created a shadow, leading me to withhold problems from my parents, even in the abuse cases I've mentioned. To this day, they remain unaware of what happened to me. This has formed a blocking within me, preventing me from sharing any feelings. Additionally, I'm now more prone to realizing my own actions, sometimes fearing that current issues, if repeated, could create similar future blockages. Additionally, I've felt itchy and my nose has been stiff ever since hearing about a dream of a man's infidelity. I find that it comes from my resonances when I do not follow my principles. I also need to work on it. THANK YOU Duyen Reviewer's Message: A lovely hello, An, I would like to send you these tips. I wasn't sure if we should bring up the question of whether she could communicate with her parents. But with a program where she has never said things, she might be led to do so. I thought that Heaven will send her dreams and that it might not be necessary to bring up the subject now. What do you think? Thank you with all my heart, Angélique, Danièle Angelic thoughts from the bottom of my heart dear DANIèlE, thank you for the beautiful review,

file: An investment; last dream id: D0021; Date of dream: Friday, May 27, 2022 Angel: 36 Menadel State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana, This week, I am busy working more than normal to prepare for transferring the owner of our company. I work hard such as completing my tasks, supporting my teammate, receiving some new tasks ...I see two opinions appearing: "feeling happy to have more work" and another "feeling tired because of too much" in my company. A percentage of myself does not like to do too much But I understand it lasts a short period. Besides, I hope that I can have more work to do in the future. In my department, this time, there is a member who has to handle more work than us. We offer to help her but she refuses because it takes more time to guide us than do by herself She mentioned many times she was too busy because of too much work. I have a feeling I want to have more work to do this time to balance among our department . In the afternoon today, I have a small meeting with my manager. He guides me to do a sales report for the future and he also has a wish to promote me to Deputy Manager. He gives me pluses: "eager to learn, manage data, work hard, be careful" and minus "communication". He gives me some ways to improve that soft communication, Taking care of others,... I am good at an independent job but I am not sure what I can do for other members if I have a higher position. What can I do in this case? I would like to share a dream as below: An owner - a man allowed me to invest money a long time to his forest I saw some trees be cut down The cut spots were smeared with substance . I asked him about that. He said those trees cannot grow again. Thank you very much Duyen

file: A complex thought; last dream id: D0022; Date of dream: Friday, August 19, 2022 Angel: 2 Jeliel State of mind: Afraid Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana This week, I am working with Angel Jeliel and Angle Haziel. I have asked "Is my boyfriend a suitable husband for my program?". I received some dreams and I just remembered some images from them. I would like to share with you the following: - I forgot to wear a bra when I went somewhere. When I found that , I quickly tried to find something to cover. - I am standing on a small object floating on a large water Last week, my boyfriend and I went to a wedding of my best friends. Two of my best girl friends asked my boyfriend about the time we will marry. I heard from them one of the reason is that my boyfriend is following many goals in his life but I never heard from him or asked him about it. Is there a point I need to improve? Out of the confirmation from the Universe, what do I need to do for my couple, for my boyfriend and for myself? I don't understand him enough. I am not sure I take care of him enough. I also have a thought many times to reject our relationship. Sometimes, I want to be married, sometimes I don't want it. Why do I need to be married? Sister Vandana, what is the right thing? What should I do? Nearly a long vacation, I do not want to come home or my boyfriend's home, because I will hear the question: "When do we have a wedding? Why do we not make the final decision?" Additionally, I would like to share another story with you. I will leave the present company at the end of this month. My previous manager offered me a job related to accounting and sales admin in a building for lease. I have not had experience in accounting but I accept to be trained. My boss is good and the environment is good. My experience does not relate to it but I would like to do it. I will have a chance to organize, arrange documents, service customers ... Besides, I have studied sql to explore data analytics. It is the beginning of a journey. I see it is not easy at this age. But I still want to enjoy it. I feel happy when I solve a problem. I do not know how far I can go but I still continue to discover it. My friend asked me where I want to gain in the long term but I do not have an answer. Is that right? Thank you very much, Duyen

file: Marriage; last dream id: D0024; Date of dream: Friday, August 26, 2022 Angel: 18 Caliel State of mind: Surprise, neutral Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana, I would like to share with you the next story related to my couple's relationship. My boyfriend had told me that he had made a decision for our relationship but he needed more time to inform me officially. Last weekend, I shared my feelings and thoughts with my boyfriend. I asked him his emotions and opinions realted to marriage. I talked a lot about my negative thoughts, bad feelings, pressures, some intentions in marriage and raising a child... He listened to my sharing. I reasked his opinion. He required me to ask him yes-no questions instead of what, how, why questions Then, I asked him if we were married? If we will get married in September as per Lunar calendar?. He said yes and he let me know that his house in his hometown is being fixed. His family will come to my home early. I am a little happy but a big worry because I have not received the answer from Up Above for our relationship. Observing myself and receiving some advice from a DSSI friend, I realized I gave myself many reasons to avoid marriage - My wrong intention is perfection so I do not accept mistakes, learn from them. The friend reminded me of my intention on a new journey. I do not follow to be a better person. I let the outside things, the memories, the future affect me a lot and I focus on the negative too much. Although, I discussed becoming a better person to my boyfriend in the past. Mantra is one of the ways to help me remember my final intention, rectify my memories and it is a process to be a better person. - I use the sentence: "My parents do not teach me about this topic" to avoid taking responsibility. I have a right to improve myself in it. - I need to communicate properly with my boyfriend. It is a lesson. I usually keep silent on the subjects related to marriage, babies, the things I love, the things I hate, money ... with him because I am not confident to show myself. - I did not improve myself to be a better person every day. I just asked the Up Above and hope they will give me the final answer. This situation helps me to face the truth, the problems I need to rectify instead of delay. Last night, I had two dreams like the one below: First dream: I dreamed of a case from the Harry Potter series. There was a man who tried to save a person but his younger sister died . Second dream: It happened in my home. There was an elderly man who could not talk . He chose a kind of medicine in a wardrobe . I took 3 perfect pills and 1 urgly pill . I asked him to take the urgly pill first to delete it. Thank you very much, Duyen

One night, after our date , when I crossed an old woman who was riding a bike at a turn , my motorbike fell because it hit a stone . I just injured my knee a little. I also received a dream as below: My friends and I had a party . After I got drunk , I had a short sleep I came back to the party and sat with my female friends in the middle of the table while the male friends sat at two sides of the table. My attitude was not friendly at that time I ate some dishes on the table. Then I saw myself at a large land. I went to a big road by bicycle and chose a direction. Firstly, I turned right on my intuition. There was something incorrect I checked the google map and discovered I should turn left . So I turned left and I saw a woman with two barriers and two spaces between them. She would like to collect a fee But I ignored her and continued my direction . I passed by a pagoda where it had a billboard selling a thing in porcelain. I guessed it should be broken to define a real porcelain thing. I have had a 4-day holiday at my boyfriend's hometown. My boyfriend spent his time at some parties with his friends. He got drunk. After a party, he came home and found me. I saw my attitude was the same as my mother's when my father came home after a party. The attitude is an uncomfortable feeling and a little angry. I used to hate this attitude from my mother and also wished I would not repeat it. Thank you very much Duyen

Anthony and Vandana, The first DJ is a reminder for me on this spiritual way. Thank you for your guiding and sharing . I would like to share my dream interpretation this week. My mother and I came to check-in at a luxury beautiful hotel . Firstly, we were in line with a crowd attending an event of Pros. Kaya and Pros. Christian to take hotel slippers Everyone I met were easily angry . I saw two pairs of pink slippers in the basket; I took one slipper and another from a person. I suddenly recognized and apologized him but he was so angry to accept . He took a slipper without retaking. Some girls were noisy so I lost my attention. I needed to take a paper for check-in. My mother and I went along the corridor to our room, we could see all beds in all rooms there. Their walls were like a door to go through. A woman staff stood in the middle of the corridor to test and she asked me. I answered rightly so she let my mother and I go through. Two old friends helped us bring our luggage to our room I said something made my mother angry. She moved to the hotel lobby. The friends and I asked the reason but she kept silent and found something until my aunt appeared. She was angry and left. I am practicing to recognize myself three positive things and one improved thing every day. It is not easy for me. It also makes me less hard to others, now I still rarely appreciate or give compliment to other people who do the good things. It is a journey and I continue to do it. Wish you have a nice day!!!

I accepted that the story reflected my inner world which was unclear about my marriage so I met that case. I came back to work with the question - "Marrying my boyfriend is the right decision?". I received a dream as below: I would like to go to the toilet knew that I could find that in my grandmother's room . I went to that room . I saw the first grandmother who was eating at a table near the door. And the second grandmother was taking the toilet beside the room . I waited for the second grandmother. After going to the toilet, the second grandmother came to the room and asked the first grandmother to clean her . The first grandmother was trying to complete her meal to do it. I went to the toilet and it has not flushed . I pushed the button two or three times continuously. Suddenly my younger brother and an animal sat on it. They made the toilet clogged then the whirlpool was very strong then splashed out. When I ran out , I remembered there was something near it. In another day, I had a dream as below: I saw my male colleague He talked to me to focus the coffee project by whispering . After that, I woke up at night. Thank you Duyen

file: Sea; last dream id: D0031; Date of dream: Thursday, September 22, 2022 Angel: 2 Jeliel State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana, After the seminar of Angel Jeliel, I came back to within more . I am so glad when I can remember the below dream a lot. I also discovered some memories causing me trouble in my relationship. Firstly, I would like to share my dream as below: I drove a motorbike with my female younger cousin to visit a beach in my hometown . I couldn't see clearly but I still tried to move. My cousin and I talked a lot about her trip with her parents before they came to my home. Then, we met two of my male friends - Ngoc and Hoang They also drove a motorbike. We greeted each other and talked, then we continued our way. I thought too much, my sharing and my action is not enough so there is a discrepancy My cousin and I came to a place where her sister slept in an object on the beach. We woke her up. These days, I continue working with the angle on the intention of my boyfriend. We must be fit at 4 levels - spiritual, lectual, emotions and physical. For me, they are still general. Could you explain to me in detail? I also shared developing qualities, my learning DSSI, some things I learned from DSSI with my boyfriend. I asked him his opinion, he still wants to marry me. I saw I didn't pay enough attention to him. He has good actions but I do not say anything, do not encourage, do not record. I focus more on his wrong actions. I let my negative memories affect me a lot. I used to let my thoughts take control and this time, I am studying and doing a way to let them go, to give myself and my boyfriend better taking care. . My boyfriend and I make love. My thought is always that he just wants my body when he does not take care of me enough I am scared to face it if it becomes true. The thought came to nature and last night, when it came, I observed it and understood it is one of the reasons why I do not believe him fully, I did not record his other good actions, his personality. I just thought about my insecurity. Thank you Duyen

file: Advance by a stick; last dream id: D0032; Date of dream: Friday, September 30, 2022 Angel: 2 Jeliel State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana I would like to share my dream. I am asking the Up Above "is my boyfriend the right person for me in this life?". Is it right to ask too much one question? I use a masculine wooden ruler fly with my female friend . It was like a broomstick We went through a forest to somewhere. THEN I lost her so I came back to find my friend. The dream shows me the uncomfortable part I am trying to avoid doing that. It causes myself the inside too much thought, too much emotion. As I shared I thought negatively too much, I used to force myself to do something instead of analyzing the meaning of my thoughts. It was a wrong way because it is still there without fixing. In meditation, I can focus on one thought and find the memories causing that to fix. I have not met my friend in a long time. She used to be one of my best friends. We spent our time in our childhood. Once, she and another friend misunderstood each other. I knew the reason so I explained the story to the friend to help them fix their relationship. My friend knew that so she thought I was a talkative, unreliable friend and she did not want to meet me anymore. Although I apologized to her, she did not accept. We didn't meet anymore from that. My parents have just called me and asked me an option for my relationship. My family want us to organize a pre-wedding party at my home on the day a feng shui master told for our couple. I have not received the answer from the Up Above so I do not follow that fully. I just let my boyfriend know that. I do not dare to share I am waiting for the answer from the Up Above. I only delay and delay. I saw myself putting my attention to my boyfriend too much. I always put all of my priorities for him. I schedule my time following his schedule. It is not right. I like to stand by him. What should I do to fix it? Because it is unbalanced. Thank you Duyen

file: My family; last dream id: D0033; Date of dream: Thursday, October 13, 2022 Angel: 35 Chavakhiah State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony And Sis Vandana How are you? Is everything okay? I have not contacted you since our scheduled meeting at 5:30 p.m. 12.10.2022. This week the Up Above gives me an opportunity to work with the Angel Chavakiah. I see the synchronization from the Up Above in this week. My brother is getting married in 2019. He keeps a relationship with a woman in chat, not his wife from a long time. His wife knew that and she felt unacceptable. She heard the story from the sister of the woman. And she also saw some messages from my brother's phone. She felt terrible and angry, so she shared it with me. Until now, my brother and she have not solved it clearly. Besides, my sister-in-law is pregnant. My family wants my brother to take a trip to HCM city to check his health. But my sister-in-law did not want that, she said my family made the decision without discussing it with her. She thought he just found a reason to gather with his friends. She was so angry. Then my brother must delay his trip. I also received a dream as below: I shared with my mother many kinds of sweet soups . Besides, last night, I also caught the card of Angel Chavakhiah and it reminded me to continue working with it. I look forward to hearing from you soon, Thank you Duyen

file: A step; last dream id: D0034; Date of dream: Friday, October 21, 2022 Angel: 35 Chavakhiah State of mind: Stressful, tired Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony And Sis Vandana I am glad to hear that everything is okay. I set a new schedule at 5:00 p.m. 25/10 for our meeting. I hope you can fix that. I would like to share my story this week. At the end of last week, after setting up basically the coffee store all day, I felt tired, exhausted and terrible. I would like to stop working. When I shared my feelings and my work with my mother, she told me this was a job I chose and I was silly choosing that. The job does not belong to my major. Besides, some old colleagues also told me the job is more simple than my ability. I also felt alone when I could not share with anyone. I reminded myself the purpose of working is developing quality. My feelings at that time were so strong. I cried a lot. I shared them with my boyfriend and he encouraged me to continue because the job will let me study how to manage a store, staffs. I hugged myself softly. The next day I continued working in my tired body. My mind still had a thought about quitting the job. It lasted two days then I became more comfortable. I have not found the memories causing that. Last night, I got a dream as below I was on the way to my grandfather's house . Then I drove around an area two times . I put a male stranger But I avoided him. I moved to my female friend's house . Thank you Duyen
