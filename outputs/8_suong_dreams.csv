C0171,D0001,18/10/2024,"my group of university friends .went on a trip to a place by the seaside When we arrived, my friend (she is a woman) and I went for a walk and took some pictures . At first, she took photos in the garden area where we were staying, but then I suggested she turn towards the sea for better pictures. Next, she climbed onto some rocks along the shore to take more photos. Then I saw a group of children appear, a lot of children , on the same rocks where she was sitting These children pulled her by the hand to follow them, and somehow, she fell into the sea (in the dream, she didn’t know how to swim) . The children watched her fall. I called for help, and her husband and one of our friends jumped into the sea to save her, but they couldn’t find her. A while later, I saw our friend standing in the sea, but the water was only waist-deep. The sea then transformed into a wide lake , and the water dried up, leaving a dried field . But we still couldn’t find her. Her husband came back with a sad face, announcing that she had died . We were all worried about how to break the news to her parents and her child. Her husband told us to stay calm while he figured out how to inform his family. Outside, the children found her lying in a hole on the field, and she was dead. They showed me, but I didn’t dare to run out and look, so I just informed our group of friends. And then I woke up.","indifferent, with a slight sense of fear",From PDF: Accident at sea.

Me: No, I don’t, sir. Guard: I’ll give you a piece of advice. If you meet someone who is bald , make sure to marry that person. I was very surprised by his words. I’m not close to this security guard, and we don’t know each other in real life. Me: Why is that, sir? Guard: Because that person will love the family very much and take care of them.

C0174,D0001,11/11/2024,"Angelic blessing hello dear Prof. Sophie Rubi’s parents asked me to take him to school. Today, Rubi had a class at a different branch of UTS, located in District 2 . I drove Rubi and one of his friends to the school . As we approached the school area, although I could see the school from a distance , I couldn’t find the entrance. I used Google Maps to navigate but still struggled for quite some time. I felt very anxious, worrying that Rubi might be late, but fortunately, we had left early, so there was still time to find the way. Eventually, I saw the school right in front of us, but I still couldn’t identify the main entrance. We realized we were standing on the other side of the river from the school, so I decided to walk along the riverbank to find the route. After many attempts, we finally arrived at the school. When we got there, two teachers, a man and a woman , came out to greet us. The main instructor was the female teacher She asked which student I was accompanying, and I pointed to Rubi, explaining that today was his first day at this branch. I also introduced his friend, who was already familiar with the school. The teacher seemed displeased and reminded me that for a first day, it was necessary to bring all required documents and complete registration procedures before attending class. This made me wonder why Rubi’s parents had transferred him to this school when the previous one was much closer to home. Later, when I asked Rubi’s mother, I learned that today, he was only attending for a single day to perform in a celebration for Teachers’ Day on November 20th, not to transfer permanently to a new school. When I picked Rubi up after class, he excitedly shared that studying there was more enjoyable and the facilities were better. Rubi was visibly thrilled as he recounted his experience. Thank you so much Thu Suong","At first, I felt anxious, then came curiosity and surprise, and finally, joy. However, I also realized that I need to take responsibility and complete this task to the best of my ability.",From PDF: Transfer to a new school.
C0175,D0001,23/11/2024,"I saw myself feeling torn and standing between two choices regarding which university I should attend . My hesitation was about the convenience of commuting during my studies, and both universities are prestigious and belong to the top national universities in Vietnam. It seemed like I had been accepted into both schools. The first university is Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology and Education, where I graduated in 2012. It is located in the center of Thu Duc City. From my house, there is only one bus route to get there, and I would need to walk about 1 kilometer to reach the campus . The second university is the University of Social Sciences and Humanities, where I am currently pursuing my second degree in reality. It is located in the university village, far from the city center, but there are many bus routes to this campus, and the buses can drop me off right in front of the school gate. I chose to study at the University of Social Sciences and Humanities because I could arrive right at the school gate without needing to walk. However, in the dream, I saw myself walking to school , and I even got lost because I didn’t know which path would lead to my university. Most of the roads to the school were still dirt roads, narrow, and not clean. As I made my way to school, it started raining heavily, flooding the roads . The rainwater flowed rapidly, carrying a lot of garbage that polluted the water . I walked barefoot through the flooded roads to get to school. Later, I felt like I wanted to return to studying at the university in the city center. I contacted a friend who studied there to talk about the issues I was facing while attending the current school and told them that the next day, I would start studying there instead and not at the current school anymore. Then, I woke up.",I feel very confused.,From PDF: Choosing a school.
C0176,D0001,04/05/2022,"Truong, Lux, Lieu and me go to traveling together by Car , the people here don't look like Vietnamese but they know how to speak Vietnamese. On the way, Truong suggested that the 3 people of us (Truong - lux and I, without Lieu) would visit a few acquaintances' houses , but I and Lux did not heed his suggestion . In this place, the population is very sparse,the roads are red- brown dirt roads .. We stopped at a Small roadside restaurant, in the restaurant there were 2 male customers eating there they spoke their language , 3 of my friends came and sat next to the 2 customers' tables and stuck in a very tight corner. When I came in later, I asked to change to another table on the left side of the table of those 2 guests. We ate and drank together, Truong repeated the suggestion that after eating we would visit an acquaintance's house, Lux didn't seem to like this , (and I'm neutral, I will follow everyone ) so when we went out, Lux and A.T had an argument . I went to first and encountered the rain , so I stood in the back of a house near the parking lot, Lieu also came out after and entered the front door of that house. Lux and Trương they came out last and argued as they walked. A moment later, Truong came to me, his hands were very dirty covered with luyn, the oil of the car was black . I asked him why his hands were dirty and he said the car was broken, he just fixed the car. I told him to wash his hands and I would go get lemons so he could remove the grease on his hands. I went into home and met a baby , I to buy his lemon and bring it to Truong, Lux also went to get water for Truong to wash his hands, when I came back Truong washed the oil stain. But I still insisted asked Truong take this lemon wash his hand again to remove odors and bacteria, finally he washed it, I went back to pay for the baby, the baby said he received enough money because my friend (Lieu) from the front of the house go down and already pay for the baby. We continue our journey. My sincerest and most heartfelt gratitude for your guide I have a question: In the example you shared in my dream for 2 last week “you know you should be gentle and calm at work or with your parents, but inside you are melting with anger, frustration, need, etc and you don't say anything, you seem to be in complete control but that's wrong”. Like this: The show my outwardly gentle, calm, outwardly gentle action is not seen as a mean action consciousness to transform the instinctive (unconscious) energy my inner. Because I think: By suppressing the natural biological instincts within I will obtain energy for the development of a conscious mind. Please help me understand more about this and how should I deal with my instinctive needs.",Happy,From PDF: The Travel.
