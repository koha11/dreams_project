C01,D0010,01/05/2025,"I was sitting in a restaurant . There were two friends sitting in front of us and turning around to talk to us and two male friends sitting to my left. While we were there, I overheard something about an upcoming birthday but I wasn't sure whose it was. I also listened to some bad news but I couldn't remember. Eventually, a birthday cake appeared, and we all celebrated— it turned out to be for the male friend beside me, whose nickname was "" Mouse "". Another male friend joined in, pretending it was his birthday too, making everyone laugh. The atmosphere was joyful, and the male friend next to me—who felt like my boyfriend —was gentle and kind and I felt a warm connection between us. Later, the other male friend mentioned that he liked cheerful work, like the kind I do, and asked me to let him know if I heard of any similar job opportunities. That day, I met with some friends who are now very busy with their children. Even though they came to a gathering, they couldn't spend much time with the group. One of my friends called me by an ugly name many times, this time, I stood up for myself and told him not to speak to me that way, but he continued, and it exhausted me. During a short conversation, he asked what I had learned from DSSI and how I could prove my level. I felt uncomfortable. I didn't feel it was the right time or place to explain what I had learned, especially since he seemed focused only on concrete results. I refused to go into detail and kept evolving his questions, though apart from me feared that might damage our friendship. Finally, one of my friends wanted to share something she was passionate about and asked me to listen. But I started to sense that some of what she shared didn't feel right to me—it seemed to deny something negative or even harmful. I felt conflicted. I didn't think she would accept my perspective. I'm still unsure what the right thing is—for me or for her. I know she means well and wants to help, but I also know I need to be true to what I've learned and believe. Additionally, I hurt my right thumb twice recently, which reminded me how easy it is to judge others without seeing the full picture. Maybe what we see as someone's mistake is actually tied to a deeper story—or even karma from past lives. This helped me remember not to judge others. Coming home and observing the way my parents live I understand that there are some renunciations I should do deeply on myself and change myself, not changing others.",Comfortable,From PDF: Nourishing a Right Love

C01,D0014,15/05/2025,"Phap and another friend cycled past where I lived. I've also felt more connected to the love I receive in my life. For example, when some colleagues made mistakes, I initially felt frustrated and thought they should have been more careful. But instead of reacting, I stayed calm and shared my point of view gently. I've become more aware that I'm working with human beings, not robots, and that awareness makes me feel more connected to them. My mother recently reminded me that while I can be a vegetarian, I should consider eating what others eat in social situations, so I can be more easily accepted. At first, I might have resisted this advice, but now I understand it came from a place of love and concern. She's worried about me, and I no longer feel the need to argue like I used to. Instead, I appreciate her perspective and even encourage her to take care of her own health, especially since she was unhappy at the time. I respect the rhythm of my family and the wisdom it brings. I feel happy and softer than before. Of course, I'm still working on my insecurities — especially the desire for love and attention from others — but I'm starting to see that everything I seek already exists within me. And I'm learning to recognize and trust that more each day.",Uncomfortable,"From PDF: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle, I would like to analyze the dreams I received in one night when I asked the Up Above if I chose to learn a Master's in a foreign country, is right for my evolution: "

It does not want to change, to step. I asked myself what the thing I wanted to do. It is the way I must step but I am scared to step. I am not sure I can commit to do it or not. I am scared that one time I will run away, I will compromise. I thought I used to do it. I compromised many times and I got karmas so the light is clear and I need to step although my negative parts are there to keep me. These days, I got dreams every night, and I practiced mantras every time I have time. I saw an important thing it is the way I sing for myself. In the previous sometimes my way is not polite, not sacred. I change the way I sing, I would like to give the best voice with the softness for my soul. It is so blessed, so beautiful.

I thought it was time to apply this principle deeply in my life. She studied a lot from many courses during this period time. She shared with us for example: energy, music affects energy, and developing ourselves, ... Our team is more connected after sharing their evaluation about three aspects: personal, family, and work, and their wish to improve them. The sharing has minuses and pluses.

It compensates my lack inside of me. Today, my roommate invited me to paint a picture following a video. It is a simple picture of the flower in the air.

He had just drunk wine with his colleagues. He has still drunk beers although he is sick - pulmonary tuberculosis as I shared. We talk naturally about some activities with each other. I felt a little bit uncomfortable at the beginning then peaceful, and happy during this experience. After that, we went to karaoke. During this period time, I invoked Angel Vasariah in my mind every moment I was alone to let me do the right thing in this situation. I slept at his cousin's house. When I slept on the couch, suddenly I felt someone look at me. I opened my eyes and saw my ex-boyfriend looking at me. I lost control and asked him how he felt about our relationship now. He said he still has feelings for me. I shared my feelings related to sad to him after his decision but I respect his choice. I asked him which option he chose for now. He needed more time and he will answer me later. We hugged each other. I see the difficulty of committing changes in the way we think, feel, and act.

I didn't have my elevator card to move to my 6th floor, so I needed to go to the reception hall on the 1st floor. It was noon, so there were a lot of employees going down. I lined up and waited for my turn. There were 3 service machines for going down on the left. When it was my turn to go down, I used the first machine, it was delayed because the machine had a problem and was stuck with the command to print company stamps. A woman ran up to take and fix half of it, but she wanted to go to the toilet so she had to leave and then come back. At that time, I realized that they were using a photo machine to go down.",Surprise,From PDF: A photocopy machine

I experienced camping in a higher land with my friends. 12 members separated to 3 camps. We made BBQ with alcohol. We drank too much. One of my friends got tired because of his heart.

It is a practice I do for myself. Thank you so much. I am so touched and have more hope and love. I had an intense conversation with my manager about insurance for our company. My company is an office rental company. We need to deal with our office tenant to buy insurance for their assets and their public liability to third parties. In the beginning, I contacted a person from an insurance company to ask some questions and understand some points. After that, I discussed it with my manager. Then we talk more deeply about the risks that may happen. When he talked more and more, I felt tired. The more we discussed, the more our conservation became very angry. I was more rebellious and did not want to go deeply into the problem anymore. I feel disturbed, I am tired. When we stopped our conversation, two of us were very angry. We kept silent after that. I also thought I was not wrong to say sorry immediately after finishing it. The atmosphere was too heavy. I took time and calmed down. I sent him a message to say sorry to him for my attitude. That evening, I felt so tired and I cried a lot. It was very heavy for me and I couldn't handle it. My manager replied and gave me some hints to understand the case of that including the way he presented the matter to me. I thought it was right. But under the Law of Resonance, it was more than that the conversation triggered my memories of the past when I had many conversations with my brother . I was in a survival mode to protect myself. I used to avoid it. I lost the global vision of our conversation. We were discussing to see the risks for our company more clearly, find suitable solutions.

C01,D0136,22/11/2024,"I was so touched when I got the DSSI certificate, which marked an important step in my spiritual journey. The right codes are like seeds in a garden nourished in my life. My life has gone up and down and up and down many times, I studied step by step to stabilize my life. It is an effort to discover myself and reconnect with the Up Above. Sometimes, I have a vague thought that I cannot accept my negative aspects. I tend to repress them when they go up by the right things like a robot. Yesterday, a DSSI student shared her stories about working with the negative parts of her life, I discovered that the way I do this is by repressing myself. She told me that I could spend more time talking, understanding, and educating it correctly. I realize that apart from it is not wrong, it also has its pluses. I can experience before jumping to the results right or wrong immediately. I realized that this week, I almost stayed up too late to watch an anime series . It is a little bit different that I read some books, meditate and do the mantra, and then watch one anime episode. While I watched it, sometimes, my mind analyzed it under plus and minus codes. But it is not right when I do not sleep enough and I cannot remember my dreams well. I resist when I do a wrong thing covered by some right things and just one wrong thing. I see myself too strictly when I just want to do the things that seem positive and reject the things that seem negative or useless. I may enjoy it like a hobby but adjust the watching time earlier. I also have a fear that I am addicted to reading light novels, manga, or watching anime. Because there are so many kinds of them. Sometimes, I doubt why I do not stay up late to watch the DSSI videos but I can do like that with manga or anime. Because the DSSI videos are very profound and good for me. I am rebellious to face the prohibited things. The negative forces are stronger than I know. How do I improve my intention? I sometimes do not pay attention to my intentions. Usually I do it as a habit. I need to give myself more time to understand myself. I would like to analyze a dream in which I cut myself at the right palm with a shape like a mountain . (The dream reminds me the way I am doing is hurting myself and losing vital enery. ) Thank you so much for revising, guiding, and supporting me with a lot of love, wisdom, and compassion ... I was inspired to continue to go on this journey with more care for my unconscious. Now I feel a little bit so fast when I study DSSI. Everything is changing in many ways in my life. I registered for the TD certificate. Could you give me some advice? Sometimes, I feel unconfident about myself when I may not study as hard as I expected over the years :) :) :).",Angel: 5 Mahasiah,From PDF: Be nice to myself
