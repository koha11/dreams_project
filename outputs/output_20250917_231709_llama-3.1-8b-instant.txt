file: A weird proposal; last dream id: D0000; Date of dream: Tuesday, February 15, 2022 Angel: 18 Caliel State of mind: Surprised, Angry, Afraid, Disappoited Dream and analysis: Good morning, my professor and assistant professor! Thank you for guiding me on this journey. I worked with the angel Caliel with the important question: "Is my boyfriend a husband fit for my developing quality" (I have asked it for two months) Here is my first dream: My boyfriend and I came back to his home - not his present house. His family had dinner but we have not eaten . I prepared the meal for both of us. His younger sister showed me the place to take the food. The preparation was nearly completed with a lack of fish sauce so he was taking it. I went down to the ground floor while he was on the high floor . Then he finished making fish sauce, I went up without his call. When I am on the highest floor, he and my old girlfriend swinged down by rope and he dropped the friend off. He intended to ask me to marry but I was at the beginning position and I was looking down. The second dream: "I was attacked by a white strong light from both sides when I ran after a friend I could not open my eyes . I did Tai Chi weakly before I fainted." I am too strict on myself, it prevents me from receiving the reality related to 2 polarities. The third dream: " My friend, Y and I discovered a white strange paint stain falling down from the roof when my paternal family gathered to celebrate flew down to find us but we escaped so it flew away. A next scene, a white paint stain from the roof fell down on some children , they just dissolved, a big creature attacked, luckily a man hit the creature and it disappeared. A next scent, when the family gathered in the attic , my mother and I saw a paint stain, and I announced dissolving immediately. Everyone except I and Y ran to the door . We hid to the back, jumped to other roofs to hide and find the signal of the creature. Some of the adults also found it when he was preparing to attack but it ran away in our way. I was protected by my cousin when I was on the roof. Then, I was on the way back home . I have just been on a bridge then a big water flowed and brought a big shark . I held the bridge and pretended to die and escaped. When I was at home, I decided to pick my lover up to my house to have dinner. His home is in a military area . It used to be a school where I spent my time when I was a child. I guaranteed to protect him and I believed I can do it. When I crossed the military school, it was a big wind but I still took him to his home." Third dream is "I was in a class and prepared for an examination . A woman teacher guided me using a cow replace a pig for the examination ." Fourth dream is " a registration of marriage " There are some memories let me leave off the spiritual way. Fifth dream is "I, Oanh Quang , Nguyen and some friends gathered at a place on a floor to chat and then moved to a party . We needed to walk to the party. The street was like a street coming to . There were. many groups dressed in different clothes . I was suddenly called from a group. The group is 3 girls wearing hoodies . I was invited to dance together with them on the platform. Then I moved to another place. All my friends disappeared . I knew they were coming back in the first place, I was waiting for them in anger. After a long time, they rode across me to leave." Thank you very much.

file: Binh Yen Noi campsite; last dream id: D0006; Date of dream: Thursday, May 5, 2022 Angel: 9 Haziel State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana Wish you have a nice day!!! This period time, I continue focusing to the question: "Is my present job still suitable for my life program?" I received some dreams from the Up-Above but I cannot remember. My company has a big change in the next time. My boss confirmed to sell our company. I can continue working at the present position. The new owner will invest and expand the company with a big mission. Is it a good sign for myself? I have not met the new owner. My manager told me the new owner was a rich group. Buying our company is just a small project. The company can join to a supply chain with other companies in the group. I think I should ask the Up Above to have an answer more clearly. I also noted a dream this week as below: 1. I came to Binh Yen Noi - in English, it means a peace place where I and my friends went camping as I told you in last dream journal. I came to take a birthday cake ..I reserved. 2. I was on the way coming to my company. I try a new way. I went up following 2 young men They gave up when they were in the middle of a slope. I felt the way was not right but I still wanted to try. I went to the highest of the slope and saw Binh Yen Noi . I told the waiter I was lost, he guided me went down because of no other ways. will be late at my work. I tried to run to my company . The company was in a building. I forgot bringing the elevator card I ran to the elevator and received the help from the guards. Coming in the company, I saw two men who were threatening me There were a man who we had a deep relationship and a man who I was in a love relationship. They were protecting me . Duyen Thank you

file: Vegetable Rows in a House; last dream id: D0007; Date of dream: Wednesday, April 2, 2025 Angel: 15 Hariel State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle, I would like to analyze this dream as below: I saw vegetable rows in a house , and I want to water them. There were Vy and Sao . I pulled the hose to water them, and had to go around in all sorts of ways. I also met a female water seller in front of the house, who didn't want me to pull the hose through her position because she felt it was quite annoying. She still let me pass. AS SAID ABOVE, Everyone told me to water them too much . The seller accidentally had an unexpected event at home and needed money. , so she asked Sao if he could pay back some of the money he owed. He went in and took out some of the water bottles to pay. That morning, before going to work, I dropped a small bottle of perfume on the ground. The bottle did not break, but a little spilled out. I did not realize that the perfume had spilled into the box of vegetables I cooked to bring to the company to eat. When I analyzed my dream, I asked myself how emotions ("water") can nourish emotions ("vegetables"). I did not realize that point consciously and it's time to work on that. It shows that I think too much more than I feel. Emotions are something that I have, but I didn't know how to nourish them. That is the reason why I am at the intellectual level more than at the emotional level. Sometimes, I just find a way to adjust my thoughts and then adjust my feelings. I also see that I do not notice my feelings enough, but I can discern my thoughts when it has a problem. This is one of the reasons making me have difficulty analyzing this dream. I asked myself: "How am I nourishing my emotions? Are emotions important to me?" There were some confusions in me for this topic. I realize that I am trying to go deeply into a topic instead of ignoring that. Thank you Duyen Reviewer's Message: A lovely hello Ân, I would like to share this interpretation with you, it took me a while to do it and I'm not completely sure. Angélique gratitude, Danièle 🙏🌸

file: A deny to connect; last dream id: D0008; Date of dream: Saturday, April 12, 2025 Angel: 44 Yelahiah State of mind: Uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle, I am so touched when I read your revision. Everything is synchronicity when I am working on my emotions with Angel Damabiah, then I receive your revisions. They help me understand myself at the emotional level. , I am on the Besides journey to research a scholarship to learn a Master's in Supply Chain Management in Europe. I want to dive deeply into the major. I have an intention to develop my patience, concentration, and perseverance. Because I discovered that I used to give up many times in learning English, it showed my difficulties in manifestation, and this year, I would like to understand it deeply. I spend every day writing down any subject like a journal, and I see myself giving many reasons not to do things, and I could persuade myself to do my best. I asked myself why I do not write down the beautiful things and the improved things I learned instead of giving up. The resistance is big and I need more time to understand it, coming from and transforming. When I practiced Yana breathing, I felt so heavy in my heart chakra. I tried to breathe through the heaviness, and at the end of this practice, I felt softer and had a strange feeling at my third chakra. I also heard a voice that why I need to force myself to breathe like this, I need to love myself, and do the soft things. I heard this voice many times, when I wanted to learn English deeply after working. The voice told me that I was forcing myself, I needed to respect my rhythm, so I do not make efforts, and I need to change to relax. And I also see my fear that I am not qualified enough to learn a Master's with a scholarship. But this time, I would like to learn to manifest in the right way, so I continue searching, learning English, and listening to Up Above's guidance through my dream and my concrete life. I was recently reminded by a DSSI friend that the spiritual journey is autonomy, I should be careful not to have a dependency on Up Above like I pray, but I do not move my feet. I would like to analyze a dream when I invoked the Angel Yelahiah - my emotional birth angel and I would like to understand why I refuse to face a conflict: I sat down with Ai somewhere. I needed to contact Bang Tuyen urgently in my hometown, because I was careless and gave the wrong information to Tuyen. When Ai knew my fault, she was very angry and required me to fix it immediately. She even started calling and gave the phone to me. But on the other side, some people were joking, so they did not reply . I was uncomfortable, and I asked her to turn off the call, and I would call again later. The previous morning, Ai was a person who asked me whether my relationship with my ex-boyfriend continued or not. Because she and another female friend wanted to kick him out of my friends' chat group that we had been added to. I said he and I stopped, and she could do what she wanted. I asked myself if it was right. He came to my friends' group, but he can be our friend even though he and I broke up. I think I am growing more and more when I improve my concentration and patience in doing the right things. Of course, it can not lack love, but it also has to have the right rigor. Thank you Duyen Reviewer's Message: A lovely hello, An, thank you for your help and comments. I would like to send you this review, as well as for the advice given. Angelic thoughts, Danielle 🙏

file: Nourishing a Right Love; last dream id: D0009; Date of dream: Thursday, May 1, 2025 Angel: 22 Yeiayel State of mind: Comfortable Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle, I came home for a 4-day holiday and I am working with Angel Yeiayel. I would like to analyze my dream: I was sitting in a restaurant . There were two friends sitting in front of us and turning around to talk to us and two male friends sitting to my left. While we were there, I overheard something about an upcoming birthday but I wasn't sure whose it was. I also listened to some bad news but I couldn't remember. Eventually, a birthday cake appeared, and we all celebrated— it turned out to be for the male friend beside me, whose nickname was " Mouse ". Another male friend joined in, pretending it was his birthday too, making everyone laugh. The atmosphere was joyful, and the male friend next to me—who felt like my boyfriend —was gentle and kind and I felt a warm connection between us. Later, the other male friend mentioned that he liked cheerful work, like the kind I do, and asked me to let him know if I heard of any similar job opportunities. That day, I met with some friends who are now very busy with their children. Even though they came to a gathering, they couldn't spend much time with the group. One of my friends called me by an ugly name many times, this time, I stood up for myself and told him not to speak to me that way, but he continued, and it exhausted me. During a short conversation, he asked what I had learned from DSSI and how I could prove my level. I felt uncomfortable. I didn't feel it was the right time or place to explain what I had learned, especially since he seemed focused only on concrete results. I refused to go into detail and kept evolving his questions, though apart from me feared that might damage our friendship. Finally, one of my friends wanted to share something she was passionate about and asked me to listen. But I started to sense that some of what she shared didn't feel right to me—it seemed to deny something negative or even harmful. I felt conflicted. I didn't think she would accept my perspective. I'm still unsure what the right thing is—for me or for her. I know she means well and wants to help, but I also know I need to be true to what I've learned and believe. Additionally, I hurt my right thumb twice recently, which reminded me how easy it is to judge others without seeing the full picture. Maybe what we see as someone's mistake is actually tied to a deeper story—or even karma from past lives. This helped me remember not to judge others. Coming home and observing the way my parents live I understand that there are some renunciations I should do deeply on myself and change myself, not changing others. THANK YOU Duyen Reviewer's Message: A lovely hello, An. I'd like to send you this review for the advice you gave. Thank you for your help; I'm learning a lot of practical things with Duyen.

To see my niece, Cat, I passed by and looked into. Dream 2 : When I lived with a friend In my countryside, . I unintentionally scared a male friend who felt I was harassing him. I didn't explain because I mistakenly thought it was just because he was handsome. Dream 3: I was sitting at the dining table with Quang , Hoang . Then Oanh came in and wanted me to decode her dream. Hoang's attitude is very unpleasant. Dream 4 : Phap and another friend cycled past where I lived. I've also felt more connected to the love I receive in my life. For example, when some colleagues made mistakes, I initially felt frustrated and thought they should have been more careful. But instead of reacting, I stayed calm and shared my point of view gently. I've become more aware that I'm working with human beings, not robots, and that awareness makes me feel more connected to them. My mother recently reminded me that while I can be a vegetarian, I should consider eating what others eat in social situations, so I can be more easily accepted. At first, I might have resisted this advice, but now I understand it came from a place of love and concern. She's worried about me, and I no longer feel the need to argue like I used to. Instead, I appreciate her perspective and even encourage her to take care of her own health, especially since she was unhappy at the time. I respect the rhythm of my family and the wisdom it brings. I feel happy and softer than before. Of course, I'm still working on my insecurities — especially the desire for love and attention from others — but I'm starting to see that everything I seek already exists within me. And I'm learning to recognize and trust that more each day. THANK YOU Duyen Reviewer's Message: A beautiful hello Ân, Short dreams, very subtle, for his guidance. I didn't note the niece's name "Cat", I imagine she dreams in Vietnamese, to avoid creating a judgment. Even if in the next dream we still see a bit of cat-like behavior. Angélique gratitude 🙏🌸, Danièle

file: Restructure; last dream id: D0014; Date of dream: Friday, May 30, 2025 Angel: 68 Habuhiah Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle This week, I achieved significant efficiency by restructuring my coffee business. A team member suggested a better salary, prompting me to reconsider. After discussions with my boss and manager, I implemented a new KPI and Revenue structure for my coffee team, offering increased bonuses for goal achievement. Other new structures were also introduced. While not exactly what she expected, it confirmed I had listened to her concerns. I reflected on why this weighed so heavily on me, realizing my appreciation for her efforts in the store. However, I recognized a need to improve how I manifest my intentions. I must commit to following my structure, including random task evaluations, which will offer a new perspective to the team. I need to act more as a manager and less as just a guide. I accept who I am and will do my best. I also found myself frustrated with a supplier who repeatedly made the same mistake. Attempts to explain were met with refusal, leading to monthly errors. I realized my energy is stronger now, and I questioned whether I could change her or if a different approach would yield better results. I need to use the right energy to communicate with her. I felt paralyzed when I realized I only had a week to submit my exercises. While I made progress this month—preparing the PR early, the Source Code in the middle, and the Angelica Yantra at the beginning—leaving me with less work, I was still exhausted this week. To counter this, I dedicated one evening to meditation and relaxation, simply lying down without doing anything. I understand this exhaustion is an accumulation of memories, and I am learning to transform them. I would like to analyze this dream: The large campus featured a study area and a residential zone, divided by a stream. I ARRIVED early, hoping to rent a temporary room for a nap However, upon entering the right building , I found every room occupied. I spoke with the female manager , alongside two other girls, also seeking accommodation. She informed me that rooms were only rented monthly and that this was the male section. She then led the two girls to the female area across the way. I sensed her discomfort with my presence, but thankfully, one of the girls pulled me along. On the other side, the other male manager said something like There were no rooms available. I saw Ngan there, though she seemed unfamiliar. Then I left. I stopped by the food court and ran into several old friends, both male and female, whom I hadn't seen in a while. They were enjoying themselves at the counter, picking out food, chatting before heading off. I was in another scene, like in a class, and there was a reaction related to lightning . I recently had a dream where I was driving my ex-boyfriend to his company, making a right turn. It felt like a stark reminder that I'm repeating old patterns. I spoke to him that he should be the one driving me. This dream makes me think about how recently I am trying to make myself in work, I have a fear that if I do not do anything, I will be like a die, I will go down, I will not develop. So even when I want to watch something, I use the English video to help me learn it and become familiar with it. I think I can give myself a little time for breaking to breathe and doing the mantra. Relaxing in the right way is a good thing for my evolution. When I think about the symbol of my boyfriend in my dream, I realize that he is a part of me and he spends most of his time working. Even when his work is over, he can cut all of his time to just work and some basic activities for a long time. He just spent a little time on our relationship after he arranged for his sport, his party with his colleagues. I accept that he needs to relax when he works a lot like that. But his balance is not easy, even though he rarely calls his family.

This dream resonated with something I learned from a video about a book, which described a teacher asking four-year-old students if they wanted to repeat the same lesson or try something new.

Thank you Duyen Reviewer's Message: A lovely hello, Ân. I'm sorry to send you so many validations; I do it less often for other students. Angélique, gratitude, Danièle

file: A Box of Butterflies; last dream id: D0018; Date of dream: Saturday, June 7, 2025 Angel: 44 Yelahiah Dream and analysis: Angelic Hello Dear Danièle Initially, I read this dream in Vietnamese in my journal, but I couldn't understand what happened, so I chose something else. However, when I returned to select a dream again, I understood this one and would like to analyze it. There's something crucial I need to grasp because while working with my emotional birth angel Yelahiah, I've noticed continued resistance. I even avoid sleeping well and struggle to remember my dreams in detail. My friends came over to my place, including Dieu and her second son , who could already talk, plus two or three other friends . We were doing something when her son wanted to leave . I went to the convenience store to buy something. Then I called a ride for her and her son. When the car arrived, she and her sat in the back with a large car seat . They sat next to another passenger. The car dropped that person off first, then her and her son. After I got back and we continued hanging out, I suddenly remembered I had a meeting at 2 PM that I'd completely forgotten about. A friend even messaged me asking why I wasn't online. I thought to myself, if I'd remembered, I wouldn't have been goofing around like this. Then I noticed the bedroom had a display box on the wall filled with butterflies and other winged insects I'd forgotten to clean it out. Before I could even touch it, they all flew out. This week, I've been reflecting on my struggle with sharing and having deep conversations, one of my ex-boyfriend symbol's distortions that I had a resonance with. Diving deeper, I realized a root cause lies in my childhood: during a conflict with my brother, my mom told me to "keep silent, don't say anything." This left me crying uncontrollably, trying to make no sound. This experience created a shadow, leading me to withhold problems from my parents, even in the abuse cases I've mentioned. To this day, they remain unaware of what happened to me. This has formed a blocking within me, preventing me from sharing any feelings. Additionally, I'm now more prone to realizing my own actions, sometimes fearing that current issues, if repeated, could create similar future blockages. Additionally, I've felt itchy and my nose has been stiff ever since hearing about a dream of a man's infidelity. I find that it comes from my resonances when I do not follow my principles. I also need to work on it. THANK YOU Duyen Reviewer's Message: A lovely hello, An, I would like to send you these tips. I wasn't sure if we should bring up the question of whether she could communicate with her parents. But with a program where she has never said things, she might be led to do so. I thought that Heaven will send her dreams and that it might not be necessary to bring up the subject now. What do you think? Thank you with all my heart, Angélique, Danièle Angelic thoughts from the bottom of my heart dear DANIèlE, thank you for the beautiful review,

I work hard such as completing my tasks, supporting my teammate, receiving some new tasks ...I see two opinions appearing: "feeling happy to have more work" and another "feeling tired because of too much" in my company. A percentage of myself does not like to do too much But I understand it lasts a short period. Besides, I hope that I can have more work to do in the future. In my department, this time, there is a member who has to handle more work than us. We offer to help her but she refuses because it takes more time to guide us than do by herself She mentioned many times she was too busy because of too much work. I have a feeling I want to have more work to do this time to balance among our department . In the afternoon today, I have a small meeting with my manager. He guides me to do a sales report for the future and he also has a wish to promote me to Deputy Manager. He gives me pluses: "eager to learn, manage data, work hard, be careful" and minus "communication". He gives me some ways to improve that soft communication, Taking care of others,... I am good at an independent job but I am not sure what I can do for other members if I have a higher position. What can I do in this case? I would like to share a dream as below: An owner - a man allowed me to invest money a long time to his forest I saw some trees be cut down The cut spots were smeared with substance . I asked him about that. He said those trees cannot grow again. Thank you very much Duyen

I have asked "Is my boyfriend a suitable husband for my program?". I received some dreams and I just remembered some images from them. I would like to share with you the following: - I forgot to wear a bra when I went somewhere. When I found that , I quickly tried to find something to cover. - I am standing on a small object floating on a large water Last week, my boyfriend and I went to a wedding of my best friends. Two of my best girl friends asked my boyfriend about the time we will marry. I heard from them one of the reason is that my boyfriend is following many goals in his life but I never heard from him or asked him about it. Is there a point I need to improve? Out of the confirmation from the Universe, what do I need to do for my couple, for my boyfriend and for myself? I don't understand him enough. I am not sure I take care of him enough. I also have a thought many times to reject our relationship. Sometimes, I want to be married, sometimes I don't want it. Why do I need to be married? Sister Vandana, what is the right thing? What should I do? Nearly a long vacation, I do not want to come home or my boyfriend's home, because I will hear the question: "When do we have a wedding? Why do we not make the final decision?" Additionally, I would like to share another story with you. I will leave the present company at the end of this month. My previous manager offered me a job related to accounting and sales admin in a building for lease. I have not had experience in accounting but I accept to be trained. My boss is good and the environment is good. My experience does not relate to it but I would like to do it. I will have a chance to organize, arrange documents, service customers ... Besides, I have studied sql to explore data analytics. It is the beginning of a journey. I see it is not easy at this age. But I still want to enjoy it. I feel happy when I solve a problem. I do not know how far I can go but I still continue to discover it. My friend asked me where I want to gain in the long term but I do not have an answer. Is that right? Thank you very much, Duyen

file: Marriage; last dream id: D0030; Date of dream: Friday, August 26, 2022 Angel: 18 Caliel State of mind: Surprise, neutral Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana, I would like to share with you the next story related to my couple's relationship. My boyfriend had told me that he had made a decision for our relationship but he needed more time to inform me officially. Last weekend, I shared my feelings and thoughts with my boyfriend. I asked him his emotions and opinions realted to marriage. I talked a lot about my negative thoughts, bad feelings, pressures, some intentions in marriage and raising a child... He listened to my sharing. I reasked his opinion. He required me to ask him yes-no questions instead of what, how, why questions Then, I asked him if we were married? If we will get married in September as per Lunar calendar?. He said yes and he let me know that his house in his hometown is being fixed. His family will come to my home early. I am a little happy but a big worry because I have not received the answer from Up Above for our relationship. Observing myself and receiving some advice from a DSSI friend, I realized I gave myself many reasons to avoid marriage - My wrong intention is perfection so I do not accept mistakes, learn from them. The friend reminded me of my intention on a new journey. I do not follow to be a better person. I let the outside things, the memories, the future affect me a lot and I focus on the negative too much. Although, I discussed becoming a better person to my boyfriend in the past. Mantra is one of the ways to help me remember my final intention, rectify my memories and it is a process to be a better person. - I use the sentence: "My parents do not teach me about this topic" to avoid taking responsibility. I have a right to improve myself in it. - I need to communicate properly with my boyfriend. It is a lesson. I usually keep silent on the subjects related to marriage, babies, the things I love, the things I hate, money ... with him because I am not confident to show myself. - I did not improve myself to be a better person every day. I just asked the Up Above and hope they will give me the final answer. This situation helps me to face the truth, the problems I need to rectify instead of delay. Last night, I had two dreams like the one below: First dream: I dreamed of a case from the Harry Potter series. There was a man who tried to save a person but his younger sister died . Second dream: It happened in my home. There was an elderly man who could not talk . He chose a kind of medicine in a wardrobe . I took 3 perfect pills and 1 urgly pill . I asked him to take the urgly pill first to delete it. Thank you very much, Duyen

One night, after our date , when I crossed an old woman who was riding a bike at a turn , my motorbike fell because it hit a stone . I just injured my knee a little. I also received a dream as below: My friends and I had a party . After I got drunk , I had a short sleep I came back to the party and sat with my female friends in the middle of the table while the male friends sat at two sides of the table. My attitude was not friendly at that time I ate some dishes on the table. Then I saw myself at a large land. I went to a big road by bicycle and chose a direction. Firstly, I turned right on my intuition. There was something incorrect I checked the google map and discovered I should turn left . So I turned left and I saw a woman with two barriers and two spaces between them. She would like to collect a fee But I ignored her and continued my direction . I passed by a pagoda where it had a billboard selling a thing in porcelain. I guessed it should be broken to define a real porcelain thing. I have had a 4-day holiday at my boyfriend's hometown. My boyfriend spent his time at some parties with his friends. He got drunk. After a party, he came home and found me. I saw my attitude was the same as my mother's when my father came home after a party. The attitude is an uncomfortable feeling and a little angry. I used to hate this attitude from my mother and also wished I would not repeat it. Thank you very much Duyen

Christian to take hotel slippers Everyone I met were easily angry . I saw two pairs of pink slippers in the basket; I took one slipper and another from a person. I suddenly recognized and apologized him but he was so angry to accept . He took a slipper without retaking. Some girls were noisy so I lost my attention. I needed to take a paper for check-in. My mother and I went along the corridor to our room, we could see all beds in all rooms there. Their walls were like a door to go through. A woman staff stood in the middle of the corridor to test and she asked me. I answered rightly so she let my mother and I go through. Two old friends helped us bring our luggage to our room I said something made my mother angry. She moved to the hotel lobby. The friends and I asked the reason but she kept silent and found something until my aunt appeared. She was angry and left. I am practicing to recognize myself three positive things and one improved thing every day. It is not easy for me. It also makes me less hard to others, now I still rarely appreciate or give compliment to other people who do the good things. It is a journey and I continue to do it. Wish you have a nice day!!!

I am so glad when I can remember the below dream a lot. I also discovered some memories causing me trouble in my relationship. Firstly, I would like to share my dream as below: I drove a motorbike with my female younger cousin to visit a beach in my hometown . I couldn't see clearly but I still tried to move. My cousin and I talked a lot about her trip with her parents before they came to my home. Then, we met two of my male friends - Ngoc and Hoang They also drove a motorbike. We greeted each other and talked, then we continued our way. I thought too much, my sharing and my action is not enough so there is a discrepancy My cousin and I came to a place where her sister slept in an object on the beach. We woke her up. These days, I continue working with the angle on the intention of my boyfriend. We must be fit at 4 levels - spiritual, lectual, emotions and physical. For me, they are still general. Could you explain to me in detail? I also shared developing qualities, my learning DSSI, some things I learned from DSSI with my boyfriend. I asked him his opinion, he still wants to marry me. I saw I didn't pay enough attention to him. He has good actions but I do not say anything, do not encourage, do not record. I focus more on his wrong actions. I let my negative memories affect me a lot. I used to let my thoughts take control and this time, I am studying and doing a way to let them go, to give myself and my boyfriend better taking care. . My boyfriend and I make love. My thought is always that he just wants my body when he does not take care of me enough I am scared to face it if it becomes true. The thought came to nature and last night, when it came, I observed it and understood it is one of the reasons why I do not believe him fully, I did not record his other good actions, his personality. I just thought about my insecurity. Thank you Duyen

file: Advance by a stick; last dream id: D0038; Date of dream: Friday, September 30, 2022 Angel: 2 Jeliel State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Sis Vandana I would like to share my dream. I am asking the Up Above "is my boyfriend the right person for me in this life?". Is it right to ask too much one question? I use a masculine wooden ruler fly with my female friend . It was like a broomstick We went through a forest to somewhere. THEN I lost her so I came back to find my friend. The dream shows me the uncomfortable part I am trying to avoid doing that. It causes myself the inside too much thought, too much emotion. As I shared I thought negatively too much, I used to force myself to do something instead of analyzing the meaning of my thoughts. It was a wrong way because it is still there without fixing. In meditation, I can focus on one thought and find the memories causing that to fix. I have not met my friend in a long time. She used to be one of my best friends. We spent our time in our childhood. Once, she and another friend misunderstood each other. I knew the reason so I explained the story to the friend to help them fix their relationship. My friend knew that so she thought I was a talkative, unreliable friend and she did not want to meet me anymore. Although I apologized to her, she did not accept. We didn't meet anymore from that. My parents have just called me and asked me an option for my relationship. My family want us to organize a pre-wedding party at my home on the day a feng shui master told for our couple. I have not received the answer from the Up Above so I do not follow that fully. I just let my boyfriend know that. I do not dare to share I am waiting for the answer from the Up Above. I only delay and delay. I saw myself putting my attention to my boyfriend too much. I always put all of my priorities for him. I schedule my time following his schedule. It is not right. I like to stand by him. What should I do to fix it? Because it is unbalanced. Thank you Duyen

Is everything okay? I have not contacted you since our scheduled meeting at 5:30 p.m. 12.10.2022. This week the Up Above gives me an opportunity to work with the Angel Chavakiah. I see the synchronization from the Up Above in this week. My brother is getting married in 2019. He keeps a relationship with a woman in chat, not his wife from a long time. His wife knew that and she felt unacceptable. She heard the story from the sister of the woman. And she also saw some messages from my brother's phone. She felt terrible and angry, so she shared it with me. Until now, my brother and she have not solved it clearly. Besides, my sister-in-law is pregnant. My family wants my brother to take a trip to HCM city to check his health. But my sister-in-law did not want that, she said my family made the decision without discussing it with her. She thought he just found a reason to gather with his friends. She was so angry. Then my brother must delay his trip. I also received a dream as below: I shared with my mother many kinds of sweet soups . Besides, last night, I also caught the card of Angel Chavakhiah and it reminded me to continue working with it. I look forward to hearing from you soon, Thank you Duyen

I set a new schedule at 5:00 p.m. 25/10 for our meeting. I hope you can fix that. I would like to share my story this week. At the end of last week, after setting up basically the coffee store all day, I felt tired, exhausted and terrible. I would like to stop working. When I shared my feelings and my work with my mother, she told me this was a job I chose and I was silly choosing that. The job does not belong to my major. Besides, some old colleagues also told me the job is more simple than my ability. I also felt alone when I could not share with anyone. I reminded myself the purpose of working is developing quality. My feelings at that time were so strong. I cried a lot. I shared them with my boyfriend and he encouraged me to continue because the job will let me study how to manage a store, staffs. I hugged myself softly. The next day I continued working in my tired body. My mind still had a thought about quitting the job. It lasted two days then I became more comfortable. I have not found the memories causing that. Last night, I got a dream as below I was on the way to my grandfather's house . Then I drove around an area two times . I put a male stranger But I avoided him. I moved to my female friend's house . Thank you Duyen

I am happy because no one pushes me to drink beer. I didn't belong to that. I did not know which subject I could share with them. I kept silent and smiled. This week, I had a date with two girlfriends. We had a dinner meal in a vegetarian restaurant. One of them talked a lot about what another friend and I should do and live in this life esp marriage. I did not feel comfortable because the conversation was more negative. She tried to push us to take action. But another friend and I needed to have more time to make decisions under our natural speed. I observed it, I felt uncomfortable but I knew if I tried to talk at this time, my tone was not good. I would protect myself. I chose to listen and understand I used to put my opinions on others. My energy went down after the date. I should be careful in a conversation. Sometimes I can take energy from others. She had a difficult period when she must show her ability to prove herself in her work. She is a part of myself which is trying to put other parts following. I am too hard on myself. I continue to work with myself, to give more love to myself and respect others' opinions. , she is on her Besides journey so I should respect it. I would like to share my dream of this week as below: I and my relatives sat and had a party at my grandfather's house together . I sat next to my grandfather. One relative constantly speaks provokingly to me . I felt angry. I throw a bowl four times to remind him. At the end of the party my grandfather told me a story from yesterday . My relatives asked a feng shui master about their good day but no one asked for me . He asked for me . My good day is December 14th according to the Lunar Calendar . Then he left. I stayed to clean. I did while I cried. I felt sad because no one took care of me. My cousin asked for help from me. But I rejected him. I cried in reality after this dream. I was reminded Evil is education. The negative dream shows the thing I should work. Thank you Duyen

I came to a relative's house (I just felt that) . The house had a bathroom for a woman in another house A man and I were in front of our house. He confessed his love to me. I was happy and confused because I also had feelings for him and I was in a relationship with my present boyfriend. I didn't say anything to him. I came into the house. I met 3 female friends going to play badminton . Then the man and his male friend came into the house to take a shower . He tries to show his erect penis to me before going into the bathroom. At that moment, my brother was also there. I went out of the house to move to the bathroom for women. I didn't remember exactly where the bathroom was. I went into the wrong house where I saw a female was sleeping with a very cold atmosphere from the referee She woke up and saw me. I apologized to her . She presented the cute things which she was selling I promised to buy them later. Then I went down her staircase. I realized I was lost, I forgot the relative's house. Thank you for your guide. I feel more touched when I have learned more about the dream. The message from Up Above is so profound, the root cause of my matter. Duyen

I am not sure about my feelings for my boyfriend. I am not sure I want him to become my husband or a father of my children. Sometimes I want, sometimes, I don't want. I usually arrange my schedule to spend my time with him rather than with my friend or myself. He schedules and spends his time playing football, having parties with his colleagues, his friends. I asked myself what kind of our relationship is, what our common things are. Sometimes, we walk in a park, visit his relatives but our topic is so limited. Besides, he has never discussed our future plans. Sometimes I asked him about our marriage. He told me he needed more time. I do not know whether I should talk about this topic because I have not received the guide from Up Above so I avoided mentioning it. This week, Prof Kaya will decode dreams via zoom. I had an opportunity to join with 2 friends. But I have not shown my invitation to my boyfriend. I hope that we can share the same topic related to symbolic language with the life purpose of developing qualities. Going to within, I am scared to be alone. It is one of the reasons why I do not want to lose him. This week, my work is not easy. My staff for the coffee store are sick and I spend most of my time working in the coffee store. I found more staff to expand the business but I have not found out. I should develop the business but it is not easy. I want to give up. I give myself the reason related to spiritual way. Then I remind myself the life purpose. This situation helps me not to be too airy, more realistic. I would like to share my dream this week: My boyfriend and I were in my room in my house . He did not wear clothes . We went out of the room to go somewhere. My grandfather and my father saw us. He came back to my room. I talked with them about my boyfriend. They advised me not to do that. Thank you a lot to be by my side, ... Duyen

These days, I have not slept well. I am easy to wake up at midnight. I felt uncomfortable, and tired in the morning. It likes I have a sleep from midnight and I have not slept enough. There are something raising from my unconsciousness and I should accept it and meditate with the Mantra to understand it . This week, I asked the Up Above whether it is the right time to change my job. I want to share my dream I received this week: I went to my relative's house on my boyfriend motorbike . I drove while my friends rode a bicycle. The road was terrible. I have not come to a specific point. I'm coming back. On my way, there was a point - a low wall . My motorbike could not cross and I should find another road. Two old women wanted me to put my motorbike next to the wall to let them climb over it, but I rejected it. They could climb on its ledges. I continue my way. Suddenly I found that the license plate was lost. I must go on the previous track. Then I saw the place I crossed but now it was closed to motorbikes. I stopped it. One of the two women kicked the ball to my face . She didn't say sorry. I was angry and shouted at her. Thank you Duyen

A lot of thoughts come to me. I felt tired and wanted to sleep back. I do not feel at ease at this time. I saw many problems in me. I want to become better in every aspect of my life. I separate my life into some fields like my work (What I can do, What should I move in the next step), my physical body (my skin sick and nose sick), my couple relationship (my marriage), my friend relationship (some friends have trouble and they are learning spiritual)... I stick to them. I am trying to fix all of them as quickly as possible. I ask for help from everyone except myself to find an easy way to all of my problems. I am escaping my life. All my problems are not from the outside. They come from my heart. I just remember that they are one from a teacher. They are different experiences to help me evolve qualities and purify my distortions. I should come back. I want to share my dream this week: I, my boyfriend , her younger sister , his cousin-sister , and his cousin-sister's daughter were in a strange place. . The sister, the cousin, the daughter, and I went along a lake . I made the daughter fall into the lake. The baby did not know how to swim. We didn't know how to swim. So we went near the lake and blared to find help. No one appeared. The daughter was taken near the bank. The cousin took her up. The sister said it was my fault. My boyfriend came to the daughter. He didn't notice me. I felt guilty and angry when I left. I am also thinking whether the right time to leave my present job. I shared my thoughts with my manager. He gave me one week to think about it carefully. Because this time is not good to change. My director wants to help me when she heard that I have a question from my colleague. I said it was another time. I notice a point. I am not ready to exchange my opinion with my director. There is a space and I asked myself the reason why I felt that. She is an excellent person in business. She runs her previous factory very well under government laws. She taught my manager very well. She is finding some new projects to expand her business after leaving the factory. I rarely talk with her. Everyone has a life program. I am not right when I looked at her results at the physical level. I should respect her rightly and recognize her qualities and distortions. , I am just besides trying to escape my work more than developing my quality. Thank you Duyen

He gave me some primary information about my personality, strengths, and weaknesses depending on my birthday. He applied not only the East's but also the West's knowledge. The most important thing I should do first is to find my core values. He guided me on some ways to find that like reading I Ching or Buddhist books. And I thought that it is developing qualities from UCM last year. These qualities are my core values and they help me make decisions. Do I understand rightly? I would like to share the dream I received before my above meeting as below: I met the person at a place. When he shared a part of myself, he called my female friend - my high schoolmate to join our meeting. From that point, he taught her his job and ignored me. There was a friend which went around the place. Then he went out. We moved to another room. He came back with low energy so he could not share anything with me. Thank you Duyen

The school was too strict Firstly, Some friends and I investigated the death of a beautiful girl our school. I was chased when I tried to solve it. Secondly, my class had almost started but I had not brushed my teeth . I moved out of the classroom to go to the toilet. I moved the movable barrier to get out. But the time was over, so I returned to the class without brushing my teeth. I received a message to move to another better class I have not solved my problem, I have a superior thought, so I moved to another matter . My female teacher checked the message before letting me out. I went to the new class. In the front of the class, I saw some students who were punished. The male teacher did not want to receive me because the class was full. But I was still there. , I had another dream Besides that I was being chased by something. I wanted to solve it, so I stopped and fought against it. My way was not right, and I died. How can I solve a case in a dream? We will have many cases and many solutions.

A couple in my boyfriend's team invited me to go out. I got a stomachache, so I went back to a toilet. His female colleagues lived full a room so I should move to another room.

Vandana, Your revising my dreams is so great . I am encouraged to face difficult memories by compassion, love, wisdom ... Thank you very much. Last night, I spent my time watching two series of Korea with two multiples at speed. The contents were not good, the characters fell in love and had sexuality too fast or they had sexuality without love. I slept around 11:45 p.m. and woke up around 3 am. I was affected by two films. I did not make a good choice for my soul. I would like to share a dream for this week. This dream appeared when I watched the Good Doctors on Netflix After school, I went to the library where Dr. Glassman is a bookkeeper. I was looking for my name in a newspaper . I also felt that I almost found that. But I have not seen it. Some friends had the same purpose as me. Then a person, Hoang , found the newspaper having his name. We finding continued over lunch. Dr. Glassman went to take the lunch and reminded us of having lunch. I still paid attention to finding it in anger because I nearly had it. I would do it quickly to come home and my mother would not be angry with me. After looking for a long time, I felt hungry so I stopped to eat. I came out and met Dr. Glassman came back, I also saw our school was preparing for the final meeting. I saw many teachers were walking. One of them was Nhan , a homeroom teacher. He was coming back to the room for homeroom teachers. I remembered I have not completed the exercises from Dr. Glassman. He gave them to me at the end of this morning. I continued looking for the newspaper. I brought high newspapers on a window to check but nothing. I realized the exercises are more important than looking. Thank you for being here Duyen

I asked my boyfriend if he was ready for our wedding. He said yes and he will propose to me. I waited. He didn't do or say anything. I asked him when he did it. He said it would be soon. Last week, I thought we can prepare some things for our wedding constantly. When I asked him if he was ready for our wedding. He said ready does not exist in this matter. But he did not answer directly so I reasked him the next day. He talked he was not ready at this time. I felt a little bit disappointed and did not understand what was wrong. I came back home and asked the Up Above if he was the right person. I doubted. I used to ask about him and I received a dream he proposed to me with the UCM Vietnam team at the beginning of this year. That night, I had a dream: I was alone in the big field at night . I felt scared. I didn't know where I should go. I suddenly woke up after this dream. I fell into a scared state. I felt lost, insecure, and alone. I tried to be calm by invoking Angel 24 but I cannot remember the name of Angel 24th although I worked with the angel many times and it was also my angel of this year. Every time, I closed my eyes, I was in a large black area. My scare appeared. I opened my eyes. It lasted about 30 minutes. I can sleep again and I received another dream named Preparing a Wedding. My relatives came to my house to congratulate my marriage . My house was beside the sea . . My parents and she came to the place to take wedding photos first. I saw the guests off before leaving there. We had thought about how many clothes we should bring. I thought it should be four . I also wanted to bring a dress but I could not because . I brought jeans and shirts. When I took clothes to the place, I should go to a canal. The place to take photos was far. I could not walk so I rented a bicycle for 5 hours. Then I came to the place.

My father became a tiger trying to chase my mother and me. My mother hid in a small house near our house. I was afraid so I ran back and forth along the corridor to see where my father was. Then my father discovered me, so I ran to my mother to ask her to let me hide. My mother and I hid in that tiny house. We were scared. The door was closed and bolted inside. The door had a large gap at the bottom. My father started to scratch continuously at the gap but we could avoid it. He lifted the roof , took the whole bucket of water next to the house, and poured it on us. The thoughts and feelings appear to try to solve. This dream shows me, my model, when I feel insecure. I have a tendency to seem okay but my inner world is terrible. This dream lets me review my childhood. When I was a child, I stole my parents' money to give to my brother. He used it to play games on the Internet and bought something for me. My parents discovered that and it is the first time my father beat me (my mother used to beat me for my faults). They said I was the one who ruined my brother's future when I gave him money to play games. He was addicted to that and he did not want to study more. I felt guilty for a long time. The second time, my father beat me when I lied to my parents I said I would go to study but I joined an event at my school. My father felt angry. I am not ready to show my opinion to my family. I become too sensitive every time like that. I hide my personality, my decisions, and my opinions. Thank you Duyên

file: A sick; last dream id: D0057; Date of dream: Friday, May 12, 2023 Angel: 13 Iezalel 18 Caliel State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Dr. Mayur Thank you for your profound sharing. After receiving your last message on my DJ, I am a little bit shocked because I am known I am not open enough with my boyfriend. I was so certain about what I should do for our relationship as I shared. I realize that he was so difficult to share every time I asked him about his thoughts and feelings. I asked myself what I should do to let him open with me. Last night, I had a date with him after a silent period. I reminded myself to open with him in my mind. I thought I need to ask and listen to him fully. I learn to be patient, not compare, and let him feel free to share his opinion, right? I asked him how he felt at this period of time. He took a lot of time to say what he thought. He said his mind has been confused about our relationship from the time when his family visited my family in 2021 and we have been in a couple since 2018. This meeting happened from his parents' plan, not from him and at that time he did not have enough courage to exchange his opinion with his family. From that time, every time, he puts me, he has pressure, and over time, his feeling decreases for me. Until now, he does not know what he should do with me, continue or not. I also do not know what I can do for myself and for him. Why do we fall into this situation? What should I do for myself and for him? The couple is not depending on feelings , it should include physical level, emotion level, thought level, and spiritual level. I used to think about how we can have the best emotions, and look forward to making them... It limits the way we experience when we just think and focus on the emotional level. It comes from the memories we recorded in our lives. I accept what he feels, what he thinks, and what he acted. It is his choice and he is learning like me. He is thinking is a plus. He wants to do the right thing for him and for me. What do I suggest to him to help him have the right choice? How about we review our past without living in the present? Is it right when he and I have discussions about our past experiences and what we learn from them? I do not want to put my opinions, emotions on him. They should be shared and understood by each other. I also have a thought, I observe his past actions, and I still see them as love gestures. It is not his complete responsibility to lie to me. Every thought and every feeling should be noticed and rectified when they are not right. I would like to analyze a dream I received from Up Above recently when I worked with the Angel 18 Caliel if I continue or not with him. My paternal family had a big party with many adults and children. Some of them were my uncles and aunts. I feel competitive so I took a beer for my younger sister after she borrowed a beer from someone. But she rejected me so I must drink and I was drunk. I walked around to find someone who helped me drink the balance of my beer. Everyone was drunk but the children. I met my boyfriend . He was also drunk too. He took me to find a place to sleep. We go up the stairs. He tripped. After that, he took his phone to talk with Bo, his cousin in Ha Noi about an upcoming football match. At this time, I got a cold. It is a sign for me not to transform quickly. It takes time. Thank you Duyen

file: Separating class; last dream id: D0059; Date of dream: Monday, May 22, 2023 Angel: 19 Leuviah State of mind: Embarrassed Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Dr Mayur, I am okay at this time. I learned a lot in this seminar. It is an opportunity to apply the Law of Resonance for my relationship. A part of myself prevented me from accepting this is my fault. I open another view. Sometimes I try to please someone to get love. To a point, I felt too lost, empty so I asked myself who I was. There was a discrepancy between my inner world and my outer world. I feel very touched after reading your revision this week. It encouraged me to continue working. I saw a part of my resistance. It does not want to change, to step. I asked myself what the thing I wanted to do. It is the way I must step but I am scared to step. I am not sure I can commit to do it or not. I am scared that one time I will run away, I will compromise. I thought I used to do it. I compromised many times and I got karmas so the light is clear and I need to step although my negative parts are there to keep me. These days, I got dreams every night, and I practiced mantras every time I have time. I saw an important thing it is the way I sing for myself. In the previous sometimes my way is not polite, not sacred. I change the way I sing, I would like to give the best voice with the softness for my soul. It is so blessed, so beautiful. The mantra helps me calm through the feelings alone, emotional dependencies, and emotional difficulties when my negative thoughts appear. Firstly, when I put a tax officer. I was scared because it is related to justice, sometimes I felt difficult every time it was related to government. This time, I just felt a little bit scared and everything is okay, he guided me clearly on what I should do. It can be easy to ask about my concerns. Secondly, today I just realize the love I received. As I shared, sometimes I felt disconnected. I can't feel the love for me. This morning, my boyfriend's sister contacted me to give me a present from my boyfriend's mother. I was confused if it is right to receive it at this time. I feel it is okay, it is a gift and I receive it with my appreciation. I called to my mother and talked about my niece and some normal stories. Sometimes I felt a little bit uncomfortable when my mom talked something. Then I spent one hour to talk with my boyfriend's mother about her gift, her life, ... naturally. After these two conversations, I felt a stranger feeling. I remembered the questions my mom asked me about the food, my difficulty, ... I feel so appreciated. I feel the love from my mother when I am far from my family. I feel the love from my boyfriend's mother. She told me the stories, and answered my questions. She also shared her health, her work naturally. Calling is one of the ways to show our love, our care. One more time, it helps me realize she represents my boyfriend's inner world, it always has pluses and minuses. My relationship is an experiment for us to learn and to do the right things. Sometimes, I felt difficult to deal with my negative thought. But I remember a guide from Prof Kaya in this seminar. Life is always a challenge. I am studying the way to give unconditional love with wisdom. I would like to analyze this dream as below: Separating class , Y and I studied with another female teacher about civic education. In the beginning, the teacher sat between I and Y at the round table. We joined the test. Y sat at the table beside the door, the teacher and I sat at the table opposite that table, between two tables was a wall. The test was the list of dishes. I arranged the order suitably. The principal appears with a friend. They sat on my right side. The principal asked me and watched me the way I cooked.

[{'case_id': 'C01', 'dream_id': 'D0060', 'date': '22/05/2023', 'dream_text': "Dear Prof Anthony and Dr Mayur, I am okay at this time. I learned a lot in this seminar. It is an opportunity to apply the Law of Resonance for my relationship. A part of myself prevented me from accepting this is my fault. I open another view. Sometimes I try to please someone to get love. To a point, I felt too lost, empty so I asked myself who I was. There was a discrepancy between my inner world and my outer world. I feel very touched after reading your revision this week. It encouraged me to continue working. I saw a part of my resistance. It does not want to change, to step. I asked myself what the thing I wanted to do. It is the way I must step but I am scared to step. I am not sure I can commit to do it or not. I am scared that one time I will run away, I will compromise. I thought I used to do it. I compromised many times and I got karmas so the light is clear and I need to step although my negative parts are there to keep me. These days, I got dreams every night, and I practiced mantras every time I have time. I saw an important thing it is the way I sing for myself. In the previous sometimes my way is not polite, not sacred. I change the way I sing, I would like to give the best voice with the softness for my soul. It is so blessed, so beautiful. The mantra helps me calm through the feelings alone, emotional dependencies, and emotional difficulties when my negative thoughts appear. Firstly, when I put a tax officer. I was scared because it is related to justice, sometimes I felt difficult every time it was related to government. This time, I just felt a little bit scared and everything is okay, he guided me clearly on what I should do. It can be easy to ask about my concerns. Secondly, today I just realize the love I received. As I shared, sometimes I felt disconnected. I can't feel the love for me. This morning, my boyfriend's sister contacted me to give me a present from my boyfriend's mother. I was confused if it is right to receive it at this time. I feel it is okay, it is a gift and I receive it with my appreciation. I called to my mother and talked about my niece and some normal stories. Sometimes I felt a little bit uncomfortable when my mom talked something. Then I spent one hour to talk with my boyfriend's mother about her gift, her life, ... naturally. After these two conversations, I felt a stranger feeling. I remembered the questions my mom asked me about the food, my difficulty, ... I feel so appreciated. I feel the love from my mother when I am far from my family. I feel the love from my boyfriend's mother. She told me the stories, and answered my questions. She also shared her health, her work naturally. Calling is one of the ways to show our love, our care. One more time, it helps me realize she represents my boyfriend's inner world, it always has pluses and minuses. My relationship is an experiment for us to learn and to do the right things. Sometimes, I felt difficult to deal with my negative thought. But I remember a guide from Prof Kaya in this seminar. Life is always a challenge. I am studying the way to give unconditional love with wisdom.", 'state_of_mind': 'Embarrassed', 'notes': 'From PDF: Separating class'}, {'case_id': 'C01', 'dream_id': 'D0061', 'date': '22/05/2023', 'dream_text': 'Separating class , Y and I studied with another female teacher about civic education.

file: My anger; last dream id: D0061; Date of dream: Friday, June 2, 2023 Angel: 37 Aniel State of mind: Sad Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Dr Mayur, This week my feelings are not good. I work concentrated but when I returned home, I felt tired and let myself watch short videos related to anime and cartoons. My feeling changes sometimes up sometimes down. My boyfriend still keeps silent after my message to exchange. I call him but he is busy with a party so I will call back later. This week, my mother asked me about my couple's status. I said it broke. She gently encouraged me to live freely. Another point I discovered was my anger. When I worked with Angel Aniel related to breaking the old pattern. I repeat a pattern . When someone did not agree with my work, I quickly became angry to show up my abilities and my other's wrong points. I have a tendency to find weak proof from others to force them to follow my point without listening fully although maybe their opinion is not suitable at this time but their intention is good. In the first story, I spent a lot of time making a file shortly, precisely but another colleague does not believe my data, so he tries to reject it. My manager also talked to me that if I am more receptive, he will let me support the customers more. Sometimes, the customer will not be satisfied and has some bad words but I should learn to deal with it politely. In the second story, my older brother called me about checking out a famous hospital for my father. It is the first time my father accepts going to check his health condition at a hospital in HCM city (now they are in my hometown far from HCM city around 600km). My father does not want to check because It will let him know his health status. My brother wants to choose the best hospital and do all the tests including gastroscopy although my father does not have pain in the stomach. I use our financial condition and the hurt in gastroscopy to reject his idea. My brother shouted at me. He said I only ignore his ideas for many reasons. I felt angry too and I do not want to continue our call. I observe my intensity. I keep silent for a minute, I see my resistance then I note his opinion. I told him I would do the things and replied to him later. We talked like that many times in a long time. Every time, he puts his opinion on others, he becomes too sensitive, he did not want to listen to others and he thought he understood this matter more clearly. I also have this like him. Esp when he is my brother. I do not like that, I used to become gentle with him in that case but it was a facade. Inside me, I still think I was right and he was wrong. I repressed my feelings and my thoughts until I didn't keep them inside anymore. When it was a facade it did not solve the matter. My brother triggered me many negative thoughts every time I met him. I see myself I have a tendency to avoid him . This lesson is very important and I should do it soon. In the third story, my roommate kept the gate key for almost a month since our owner gave her . When I asked her to give it to me because I need to go out in the early morning. She gave me two keys and said she could not remember what is the right key. I asked her to check and give me the right key. But she rejected it. I felt angry without understanding her case. And she ignored me and didn't say anything. These cases make me feel tired, hard and do not want to do anymore. I realized the Up Above brings them to teach me, to stop me nourishing my anger. It took a lot of energy and the aura was terrible. I practice a lesson. I imagined each above story and I changed the way of talking from my brother, my roommate, and mine around these matters to gentle and right before sleeping. I understand they are parts of me, and I am improving my communication. Do I understand right? These days, my stomach does not feel good. I felt a little bit uncomfortable. The stomach is related to my feeling centers, I have difficulty digesting and nourishing my feelings . I would like to analyze this dream: My boyfriend , my mother and I were on the way. I saw Hoang . So I called him, my mother became angry but I argued with her. Thank you Duyen

file: A movement; last dream id: D0062; Date of dream: Wednesday, June 7, 2023 Angel: 61 Umabel State of mind: Neutral Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Dr. Mayur This week, I observed one of my points of view in my life. Life is so short and I must save my time. Sometimes I make the decision in a hurry. If I didn't do it, I would regret it in the future. It is not right when we are a soul. We must follow the natural movement under developing the qualities. It is also an aspect of patience. I would like to share with you some good news. I met my boyfriend and we had a beautiful meeting. I almost felt soft and comfortable. I shared my feelings, and my intentions for my couple: developing qualities with 3 options (continue with the right intentions, pause in one month and stop our relationship). He had difficulty making decisions. I was patient to let him think, give him the plus and the minus of each option, and share what I have learned from UCM in the three years since I knew UCM and the way of making decisions under developing qualities. He did it. He chooses option 3, stopping our relationship. I respected his choice. I felt sad but the process of sharing gives me the courage to continue to advance. The pain is still there. I discovered some new parts of myself: some patterns in love, and some wrong intentions in owning a person, ...When I observed my miss of my boyfriend, I thought a part of it came from my possession , my instinctual needs. I love the knowledge from UCM but I see my resistance. How could I work it rightly? This week I would like to analyze this dream as below: I joined a party with my aunt 's friends and some of my uncles at a beautiful house , which was made from bamboo and raised on stilts over the surface of the soil. The party was done in the middle of the house. The front of the house is a beautiful lobby. People sit in a long line, female, male, and then female. I sat at the end of the line. Sitting a little bit, I went to the front to take photos of my aunt and nephew. But I couldn't take a beautiful photo. I took a rest. It rained. The ceiling was not sealed. Some friends started leaving. My aunt, uncle, and some nephews sat in a great place to take photos. Those friends needed to take shoes at the place I took photos so I was reminded to go out. But the photos were not beautiful so we stopped. One of those friends lost the vehicle card. Thanh Linh gave his card to the friend. My boyfriend was also at the party but in the beginning, he was so strange to me. Until now he reminded me Thanh Linh used to help me like this. Although at that time, his help was not successful, I did not remind. Then I leave but I still want him to keep me back but he was still strange to me. I heard from 2 men why the owner did not let the bank rent this place because the owner must rent the guard but letting the bank rent will get more money. Thank you Duyen

file: Visiting a cinema; last dream id: D0063; Date of dream: Monday, March 28, 2022 Angel: 38 Haamiah State of mind: Afraid Dream and analysis: Dear Prof. Anthony and Sis. Vandana, I hope you have a nice day! I would like to share a dream which I asked the Universe if the job was fit for my evolution. The dream is as below: My father and I went to a cinema by motorbike. We stopped at the parking lot which was opposite the cinema and at the foot-slope. There were two female street vendors offering us food and drink too much. Then we agreed to buy and we ate there. My father suddenly wanted to gamble with the lotteries of the vendor. He lost. When everything becomes difficult, I will just do a new thing with a hope of luck and lack of going deeply to clean the negative memories. After eating, my father and I left the waste for the vendor We also received a reminder of cleaning from a female guard standing far from us but we still continued. The vendor did not clean and left. My mother and I went to a cinema by motorbike. Inside of me, I continue comparing myself with others. An old girlfriend appeared and went with us. My ex-boyfriend wanted to meet me but I rejected and he followed us . My mother and I left our motorbike at a parking lot and walked to the cinema. The cinema was crowded. There were many people walking too. The old girlfriend told me a story about my ex-boyfriend. When I was taken to a country, he betrayed this country to take me back . My mother and I saw a crowd. I saw my boyfriend fixing his motorbike with my brother. The motorbike has a chain trouble. He tried to watch the movie with us. Two girl strangers told me his other problem - crossing the red light and getting punished. I was angry because he didn't tell me. Before bringing his motorbike to be fixed, he and I came to the cinema to buy a ticket for him. I did not want him to watch because I did not want him to see my ex-boyfriend. At the main door, there was a stranger who gave us a ticket - 30 thousand VND. I realized my ex-boyfriend was behind the scene. I rejected buying My boyfriend and I came to the ticket office. There were 2 women who sold the tickets for a couple Thank you very much, Duyen

file: A break; last dream id: D0065; Date of dream: Thursday, June 15, 2023 Angel: 16 Hekamiah State of mind: uncomfortable Dream and analysis: Dear Prof Anthony and Dr. Mayur This week I received some signs related to angle Achaiah, I woke up at 2:2 then I watched the online course from An Nguyen about skin, I read a message from my mother to inform my father was hurt in an accident. He got some damage but they are not significant. But his left shoulder was not good, his hand could not lift up. He took an X-ray scan but his bones are okay, Now he should follow it in a period of time. I watched the course "The Birth of a Dream" by Prof Kasara. It is so touching, profound, and inspiring. It is very very beautiful. Prof Anthony and Prof Kasara are joining the project in equilibrium. I asked myself why I miss my relationship and still hope when we are not balancing and mixing many things. I continue to work on my memories to be myself within and outside. My family has a problem related to my brother's couple. He does not share or give money to his wife esp when they have just had a baby. It is an accumulated matter for a long time since they married. Their marriage and their having a child are a push from family so it is not right in their attitude. His wife does not respect him. It is a lesson to let them learn. I also need to cleanse my memories related to that. Next, my brother found compensation from outside by talking to a woman. It is not the right way to solve a problem. How do I use money rightly at my personal, couple, and family level? When we move to a higher level, we must manage money in the right way. Maybe two members should give 50/50 or 40/60... to a common account and arrange it clearly. One day, I asked myself what next after our relationship's status. I felt scared to face the truth. When my friend asks me about our relationship, I am not ready to share it. I saw myself keeping hope to come back. That night, I received two dreams as below: 1. Quang returned home from the Philippines . He invited my friends, me and my ex-boyfriend) to meet for a drink . I sat at a table near their table. I needed to complete a task before meeting them. I missed my task a little bit. When I lack concentration, my task could take more time to complete and I just want to complete it quickly. My intention and the process are very important. When I completed my task, they were ready to leave the party after sitting overnight. I saw Oanh 's face was very wet. A difficulty to transform emotions in the right way when I have a facade and expectations. I stood at the parking at a distance from them. I only met Quang. I explained the reason why I could not join and my relationship's status because my ex-boyfriend was also in the party. He sympathized with my story. 2. The second dream I received after noting the first dream, most of the characters are strange. Some friends and I were in a rented house . That night, two girls were very noisy for a matter. One of the two girls must pick up her mother and boss at the airport. My ex-boyfriend, the other girl, and I sat next to the window for talking. Then a couple came. I thought it was a coincidence but the girl had an appointment with them. They left. I asked my ex-boyfriend how to use a notebook . I kissed his cheek before I left him to take my notebook while he arranged his notebook. I reminded myself it was not right in my mind. He did not react. When I come back, he guided me on how to use a notebook. Thank you for your support on this journey. Duyen
