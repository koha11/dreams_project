C0237,D0001,07/04/2023,"I continue my intention: please help me understand the memories of my old best friend. on the bed, I lie in the innermost, Kasara is in the middle, and the outermost is a newborn baby, Ha 's child. The opening dream shows that I am being overly protective of myself, too secure, lacking in outward expression (my position is in the innermost). At the same time, on the outside action side, I sometimes appear too soft, fragile, to be protected, attracted attention, too open, joking. My inner Kasara in the middle is like a protective wall that I built to protect myself. Ha told me and Kasara to look after the baby carefully, so as not to let him fall off the bed. It seems the baby is a bit naughty. I feel a dangerous position, but I trust Kasara, so I still focus on talking to Kasara. I was too focused on protecting myself, because it was so safe that no one could interfere, and because it was so easy. And because of the lack of self-interest on the outside (expression, even appearance), my inner baby has a tendency to be disruptive, mischievous to get attention, and as natural of a baby when not cared for or guided. When Ha passed by, she saw that the baby was slightly rocking and seemed to be about to fall off the bed. Ha reminded myself and Kasara. At this time, Kasara hugged the baby in her arms and said that if my child died, I would not regret it. Then she put the baby inside, between herself and me. I was amazed and thinking: oh, how can Kasara be so independent, so determined and so unattached like this? A moment later, Kasara was talking to me about Ha's problems. She stood next to the bed, pointed directly at Ha who was lying on the bed and holding the baby in her arms, and said: emotional dependence. I followed Kasara's hand pointing at Ha and was a bit surprised. I have a certain % that can judge others, based on the spiritual knowledge I have learned, I can see a % of what knowledge I am relying on to be able to tend to want to teach others. Perhaps the fact that I have found myself tending to judge others, however, here my surprise at the fact that my inner Kasara was the one to speak out shows that I still lack humility, too knowledgeable, and use the knowledge they know to believe that I am superior to others and have the ability to judge people. The dream also made clear the answer I asked about the resonances with my old best friend: emotional dependence. And having 3 women in my dream shows that I have built my inner self (Angel 3 Sitael) in these memories since childhood (Phuong is my best friend and Ha is my biological elder sister outside in real life). During working with Angel Leuviah this week, I feel my physical body is quite tired, sluggish, lethargic, I have a sore throat and a little nausea (manifestations like having a cold). At the same time this week I am also in the new phase of going to the gym, so maybe these events, which are similar to this dream, show me about illness, lack of ability to protect myself outside (weak physical body). When I reflect on myself, during the last time I worked at the company, I realized that my ability to express myself (talk, give opinions and act) was quite weak. In most of the meetings, I keep silent, listen and act, however, recently the results of the implementation have been unsatisfactory and always need to be revised. I've been thinking back to myself for the past 2-3 years, at work (jobs that carry energy fueled by excessive material needs, authority, feminine tends to dominate, masculine sometimes a bit soft), I feel like I'm stuck, not able to show my full potential like before. I also tried, but failed. Perhaps in myself, there is resistance, self-limitation, and self-protection against the desire to receive these energies (in the direction of denial).",Surprise,From PDF: 08 Dream - Kasara and baby [2023]
